There are many different types of chronology for this period, as it is based on a variant of the "Three Age System", and the dates are transferred from another region. Lack of exact information on the beginning date of the Middle period of the Chalcolithic era caused a 500-year gap between the Early and Middle Chalcolithic period. Also, the exact date of the end of the Late Chalcolithic and the start of the Bronze Age is not known. Based on data found in the literature, the duration of the Middle and Late Chalcocithic period in central Anatolia is dated to 5500-3000 BC. As already mentioned, those are contractual dates, transferred from other regions. It was not possible to determine the peak date for this period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]C. Renfrew’s hypothesis states that people in this region and era were using a language of Indo-European origin. There are many variations of the Middle and Late Chalcolithic culture, which depended mostly on geographical factors and external influences (e.g. the position of the settlement, sources of raw materials , beliefs , etc.).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Different groups and settlements reached the Early Bronze Age in many different ways. Archaeological sources show strong economic relationships between those settlements. Evidence for these relationships can be seen, among other kinds of proof, in some products, such as kitchen utensils, tools and materials used for manufacturing these.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Agriculture, hunting and gathering are seldom mentioned, due to the scarcity relevant research materials having been published throughout the years. Also, there is no information about farming techniques used by the Chalcolithic society. Their diet consisted mainly of plants grown next to their houses. Animal meat was consumed very rarely (some bones of both domesticated and wild animals have been found and there is evidence of fish and turtle consumption) .[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As was mentioned above, this era is considered as the dark ages. So, in order to obtain information about anything besides ceramics, a large number of publications had to be worked through. One of the issues that arose was that the sites that are considered Chalcolithic were studied in the late 60s of the last century and they resulted in rather poor quality information from those excavations. Also, due to Turkey’s ban on any foreign archaeological excavations in that area, it was nearly impossible to acquire any new samples for the analysis. The coding is mainly based on excavation reports, as the information in these has minimal additions from the writers.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Dead people were usually buried under the floors inside the houses - it can suggest that skeleton burial was in place. Bodies were very often tempered with - for example, laid on their side in a contracted position or hampered to fit into small pits. The dead were wearing jewelry upon the burial, and also had other grave goods, of which one of the most impressive was a bronze bracelet found with one of the skeletons (unfortunately, as no anthropomorphic studies very performed, we do not know what sex the buried person was). Very often, one grave had many bodies.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Artifacts resembling contemporary Balkan styles found at Çadır and similar regional sites may indicate that the peoples of the central plateau also had some contact with Southeast Europe"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Used to cover walls and floors.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In all Chalcolithic Age levels of Yumuktepe; baked clay spindle whorls and clay sling pallets are the dominant types.

Can Hasan[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Floors inside the houses are of clay, although in the south-east corner of House III there is a patch of pebble floor. Outside the houses there are the " courtyards ". These, usually, have a hard floor of white clay."

Support and reinforcement was given to each wall by small beams measuring up to o-o8 m. in diameter. These were placed first horizontally close to the outer edge of the wall and parallel with it ; then vertically, again near the two faces of the wall; and finally cross-wise through the wall. Each wall was thus efficiently and strongly held together."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Flint/Obsidian present [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Obsidian blades (Can Hasan)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Long obsidian blades[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Obsidian was not common and when it did occur consisted of simple blades.

Large free-standing one-room buildings - Can Hasan 1, Camhbel Tarlasi, Earlier also in Ikiztepe.Buildings built of mud brick, mud assumed. Brick or stone foundations situated on the mud. Use of wood to reinforce the structure. The construction of roofs was probably the same as in contemporary Can Hasan. Old walls were used to build new structures [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]markets present. We do not know whether they were polity owned or not. However, it is worth pointing out that something like this existed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Probably found shop for renting cooking ware:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Within were once wooden shelves holding dozens of vessels of all shapes and sizes, including Omphalos bowls with dimples in the bottom, a staple Çadır pottery tradition. Outside these buildings were large, apparently private, courtyard areas."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Trade existed in the Midlle and Late Chalcolithic. Evidence for this can be found in the settlement of Çadır Höyük: "Frequented perhaps for a major local market or a bazaar for exotic trade goods."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Shells[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]River and volcanic stones served as polishers and grinders[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ivory (bracelet), Can Hasan[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"From various squares came about fifteen pieces of imported ware of the Mersin XXIII-XX range."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>In Çadır Höyük, a source was found for the production of pottery production.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Interesting case is the miniature vessel found in Yumuktepe[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In this layer a large number of very typical and almost identical pottery, found almost intact, was found which had been produced on both a fast wheel and by hand.

Copper or bronze bracelet was found in the grave (Can Hasan) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Inside Çadır Höyük, a fairly well-provisioned house was found - the "burnt house" with a large courtyard and two stories. It had an assemblage indicative of craft activities such as stone tool production and textile production, as well as metal jewelry and a lot of pottery in its inventory[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sources revealed during excavations at Can Hasan, (layer the middle Chalcolithic) show pieces of polychrome ware. Polychrome ware was produced only in Can Hasan[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]A large number of various shells were found. They made them into necklaces and earrings, possibly also applied on fabrics. The remains suggest that it housed a workshop (shells worked and unworked)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"With the group of small objects in S 21 c was a large number of shells of several varieties The worked examples had been made into pendants of various types (P1.

Others were unworked or partially worked and confirm the impression that this may be the remains of some kind of workshop"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]On the basis of sources, we can suggest there were workshops producing figurines of clay or stone. Examples of findings:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]-Two clay figures depicting women. Characteristic features are excessively elongated head and neck. Together exceed the height of the lower part of the body(Can Hasan)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_TrClcLT].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]-"The position of the better preserved is squatting with legs tucked underneath. The body is distinctly obese. On the head fragment the eyes, ears and nose are portrayed plastically but the mouth is not indicated. There is also a crown or headdress. The clay of these figurines is coarse, heavily tempered with straw ; the surface was given a fine white slip and probably burnished.

Indeed, there is some evidence to support the idea that raw materials were exchanged over considerable distances. This is manifested, for example, in the exchange of obsidian; a site such as Aphrodisias contains obsidian from Cappadocian sources and the Aegean islands of Melos and Giali, and a similar situation has been documented at Dedecik Heybelitepe. However, there is also evidence for the exchange of artifacts produced especially for export purposes and produced in labor intensive local industries. The best evidence for this comes from the Middle Chalcolithic site of Kulaksizlar, located in western Asia Minor. At this site, there is evidence for the production of stone vessels and figurines. These were produced from marble, and a large number of blanks, waste by products, manufacturing rejects, and stone working tools were found here, constituting about 90 percent of the surface assemblage. The most common artifacts produced at Kulaksizlar are pointed beakers and ‘Kilia figurines"".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_TrClcLT][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Middle and Late Chalcolithic era in central Anatolia was dominated by agricultural villages, exploiting natural resources such as salt or obsidian, which could be also exchanged with other groups. At that time many specialized workshops existed that produced items used for exchange (dishes, blades, shell ornaments, etc.). One of the most important raw materials for the Chalcolithic society was clay, because of its wide use in the economy. We also should not forget about the importance of stone, which served not only for making tools and figurines but was also part of house structures (e.g. foundations). Timber was also a valuable resource - so when abandoning a house, all wooden structures were dismantled in order to re-use it for a new home. Obsidian was used mainly for manufacturing blades, while animal bones were used as a material for making tools and jewelry. Copper, just like wood, was a valuable raw material for every village. Many copper items such as maces, axes or bracelets have been found.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During this period, living quarters were based on a honeycomb model. Buildings formed large clusters, dividing into smaller ones as they got closer to the center. They were mainly built from mud-brick and probably had a few stories - this hypothesis is based on foundation excavations of the load-bearing structures such as pillars made of wood. The insides of these buildings consisted mainly of a few small rooms, of which some were used as storage areas or private quarters. The inside walls and floors were plastered, sometimes decorated (geometric patterns, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic decorations - very often showing bull as main subject of the drawing). The dwellings were built with wooden elements that were removed when vacating the house (hence pits in the foundations). The houses were used for a time period of 10 years up to a few decades, and after that time they were demolished to build new ones in their place (sometimes, the houses were burned down as a part of a ritual). Thus, the tallow settlement had risen - through the constant material accumulation. The settlement consisted of many different types of buildings. It was possible to distinguish the ones that belonged to the elite by their size and complexity.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ [2-3] ♥</b>1.

There is also evidence for a cult linked with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines. This was a common cult and the figurines related to this are found in many places. These figurines were made of clay and stone, sometimes painted with precision to show as many features as possible, and other times made schematically, not putting much emphasis on the details. The height of such figurines could vary from a few centimeters to even a meter or more. Interestingly, some of them do not have heads, and could have been intentionally deprived of them - thus suggesting a link with the cult of the skull, which started in the areas of Anatolia already in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A era.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Military levels ♣ [2-3] ♥</b>1.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2.<div>3.
