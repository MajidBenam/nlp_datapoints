Teotihuacan state built mutually peaceful relationships, while both states were more powerful than other neighbouring polities. Neither conquered the other (based on distinct material culture and architectural styles) but did trade with one another.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_MxAlb3A] Evidence for this includes the Lapida de Bazan (a carved stone slab at Monte Alban) which depicts a peaceful meeting between a Teotihuacan ambassador and Zapotec lord.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MxAlb3A] In addition, there is evidence for a "Oaxaca barrio" at Teotihuacan, with pottery styles dating to the MA II-III phases.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MxAlb3A] Political and ritual (as well as commercial) relationships were also probably maintained between the Zapotec state and former territories, such as the Sola Valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MxAlb3A]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supra-cultural_relations">Supra-cultural relations</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb2* ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The centre at Monte Albán continued to grow during this period, but the territorial extent of the Zapotec state outside of the Valley of Oaxaca declined.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ MxAlb3B ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Zapotec ♥</b> The valley became much more integrated during this period, with a consistent “Zapotec ceramic tradition”, Monte Albán stone monument styles and a wider distribution of settlements in the piedmont zone away from Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Monte Albán ♥</b> Monte Albán continued to grow during this period, and reached peaked in population size and settled area.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Zapotec ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxAlb3A]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4><div>The Monte Albán IIIA phase (200-500 CE) is generally regarded as the 'golden age' or Classic period of the Zapotec state,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxAlb3A] due to the widespread uniformity of ceramics and monumental construction as well as increased economic and political integration, centred at Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxAlb3A] The population of the capital, Monte Albán, continued to grow and the construction of monumental buildings at the site reached its peak. These buildings dominate what can be seen at the ruins of Monte Albán today.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxAlb3A] Additional settlements were established in the piedmont area (including Jalieza with 13,000 inhabitants in the southern sub-valley and Dainzú-Macuilxochitl-Tlacochahuaya-Guadalupe [DMTG] with 12,000 inhabitants in the eastern sub-valley).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxAlb3A] The movement of people into the piedmont areas may imply an increase in demand for agricultural labour during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxAlb3A] The territorial extent of the Zapotec state, on the other hand, decreased during this period in the face of increasingly powerful competitors on the borders of the state. Previously subordinate areas, such as the Sola Valley, became independent of the Zapotec state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Five named rulers are known for this 400-year period, identified in public monuments in the vicinity of the Main Plaza of Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MxAlb3A] Status appears to have been inherited and related to one's proximity to apical ancestors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MxAlb3A] Burial remains and the differences in construction of residential buildings suggest two class-endogamous strata during this period, with the majority of the population (an estimated 96-98 percent) belonging to the commoner class.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MxAlb3A] The Zapotecs focused on internal consolidation: an increasing proportion of settlements were in defensible locations or had fortifications, and there was agricultural intensification in the piedmont and high alluvium zones.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_MxAlb3A] There was also a pattern of settlement clustering around the main centres, similar to the pattern shown in the Monte Albán Late I phase (300-100 BCE), except the clustering occurred around secondary centres as well as around the primary centre, Monte Albán.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Archaeologists Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery estimate the population of the valley to have been around 115,000 people during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MxAlb3A] A population range of 15,000-30,000 for Monte Albán is based on the estimated number of people living in each of the households at the site. Larger households may have included 10-20 people, while 5-10 may have lived in the smaller households, although this may be an underestimate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MxAlb3A]</div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Complexity_variables">Social Complexity variables</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Alice Williams ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [3,000-20,000] ♥</b> squared kilometers.

The archaeological data indicate that much of this architectural complexity was in existence by Monte Alban II (100 B.C. through A.D. 200). Many of these buildings do not appear to have been residential and most likely served an array of religious (e.g., the various structures associated with two-room temples), military (such as Building J and perhaps the Ballcourt), and other "administrative" functions (including a variety of other public/institutional buildings the functions of which are still unclear). At the same time, it is probably also appropriate to consider the quihuitao (royal palace) to be another example of a public/institutional building. Both the main candidate for a quihuitao at Monte Alban (the Patio Hundido complex, according to Flannery) and also the example recently excavated at El Palenque (which was probably the capital of a rival independent state polity in Late Formative times) near San Martin Tilcajete (see Spencer and Redmond 2004 in Lat Am Antiq, and Redmond and Spencer 2017 PNAS) were not associated with tombs like other elite (and non-elite) residences; also, both examples had "residential" as well as "ceremonial/governmental" components. Note that the El Palenque quihuitao is securely dated to the Late Monte Albán I phase (300-100 B.C.)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_MxAlb3A]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_MxAlb3A]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_MxAlb3A]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ irrigation systems ♣ present ♥</b> There is some evidence for the use of irrigation systems during this period, but the evidence suggests that the irrigation systems were constructed at a small scale.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_MxAlb3A][MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_MxAlb3A] How much was polity owned is therefore difficult to determine.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_174_MxAlb3A] From Religion: "Mortuary evidence from the Central Valleys shows a concern with constructing and maintaining memories of the genealogical relations of household heads (Urcid 2005). Most people were interred beneath the rooms or patio of their houses, although occasionally burials were located outside, but in the general vicinity of residences (figure 7.3). Urcid (2005:28- 44) shows how conjugal pairs who were the heads of households in each generation were successively interred in tombs or, in the case of some lower-status residences, in stone-lined cists. Archaeologists often find that Zapotec tombs, when opened and explored, contain a jumble of skeletal remains of many individuals along with offerings such as pottery and jade with few articulated interments. Urcid argues that these remains represent a sequence of household heads with the bones of earlier interments disarticulated and mixed due to later openings of the tomb for rituals and burial of descendants (also see Middleton et al. 1998). "Other members of the domestic group from infants to elders were interred in stone-lined cists, graves, and occasionally in reused pit features. High-status residences often included burials of adult females with elaborate offerings that Urcid (2005:40- 1) interprets as the secondary wives of male household heads, which is consistent with evidence for polygyny among nobles at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Neonates and fetuses were often placed within ceramic vessels and usually did not include offerings, suggesting that they had not achieved full adult personhood. These patterns mean that individual residences usually had several different kinds of interments, including at least one tomb. In houses occupied over long periods, the tomb might be expanded, or additional tombs constructed. "The architectural elaboration of the tomb as well as the quantity and quality of offerings found in tomb and non-tomb interments correlates with other indicators of status such as the size and quality of domestic architecture (Urcid 2005; Winter 1986:353- 61). Mourners often decorated the bodies with shell, bone, and greenstone ornaments, suggesting beautification and the marking of status or other social roles of the interred. Tombs and burials were accompanied by offerings of ceramic vessels, sometimes including urns that symbolized deities or ancestors. Dozens of vessels recovered from some tombs suggest the wide social networks of the deceased. In tombs, Zapotecs used red pigment to decorate the bones of earlier interments and at times bones of ancestors were removed for use as heirlooms in validating status (Urcid 2005:36- 7). People often performed sacrificial rituals as part of the mortuary ceremony with dog sacrifices associated with both commoners and nobles, whereas bird sacrifice was restricted to nobles. Interments of rulers may have at times included human sacrifice."
