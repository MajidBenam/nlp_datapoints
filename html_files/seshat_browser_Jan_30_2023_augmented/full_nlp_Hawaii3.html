integration' again in the time leading up to Cook's arrival.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_Hawaii3] By about 1580 'Umi had ascended as ruler of the entire island.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_Hawaii3][MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_Hawaii3] In Kirch's reckoning, 'Umi was the first true <i>king</i> of the Big Island, as opposed to the mere <i>chiefs</i> who had governed the island until then. 'Umi did not fill a merely ceremonial role, as the previous chiefs had, but controlled the use of land, instituted a system of territorial administration and ahupua'a land parcels, intensified food production, specialized labour, and elaborated the religious system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_Hawaii3] I think we can consider this a unitary state. 'According to Kamakau, 'Umi divided his kingdom' between two of his sons, Keli'iokaloa-a-'Umi and Keawenui-a-'Umi, thus splitting the island, but Keli'iokaloa defeated his brother in battle and 'became the king of a once again unified island'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_Hawaii3] After the death of King Lonoikamakahiki c. 1630 'follows [a] phase of political fragmentation, when the leeward and windward regions came under the control of the Mahi and 'Ī lineages of Kohala and Hilo, respectively'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_Hawaii3] Nominally, Keakealanikane became king of the island, but 'his reign was either ineffectual or simply not recognized by the district chiefs'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_Hawaii3] After the death of Keakealaniwahine around 1690, her son Keawe-'ikekahi-ali'i-o-ka-moku 'established some degree of unity over the island, even though the district chiefs retained considerable power':[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_Hawaii3] this sounds like 'loose' control. After Keawe-'ikekahi-ali'i-o-ka-moku's death, 'A strong and powerful kingship reasserted itself again ... with Alapa'inui' c. 1710.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_Hawaii3] Around 1752 CE, a warrior chief with a claim to the throne, Kalani'ōpu'u, rose up against Alapa'inui and 'gained control of his natal districts of Ka'ū and Puna, while Alapa'inui ruled the rest of the island', so the Big Island became a quasi-polity once again.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_Hawaii3] After Alapa'inui's death, Kalani'ōpu'u managed to defeat Alapa'inui's son Keawe'ōpala and gain control of the whole island - this must have happened around 1755 as Kirch tells us that Keawe'ōpala's reign began c. 1754 but 'was short'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_Hawaii3] Kalani'ōpu'u 'devoted considerable attention to administration' and held onto power long enough to greet Captain James Cook off the windward coast of Maui in 1778.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_Hawaii3] (Dates are approximate here due to the oral-historical nature of the sources.

The more powerful of these <i>ali'i</i> held more than one ahupua'a.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_Hawaii3] Below the ahupua'a chiefs, <i>konohiki</i> land managers (often their junior relatives) oversaw the collection of tribute from the commoner farmers, known as <i>maka'āinana</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_Hawaii3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Overall, this period was characterized by a high-density but stable population settled in all ecological zones, a secondary intensification of the dryland field systems, and endemic conquest warfare.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_Hawaii3] The population of the entire Hawaiian archipelago by Cook's arrival was certainly very large, but there is a long-standing debate regarding exact numbers.

Royal/chiefly centre[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>2. Dispersed households</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Hawai'i lacked anything approaching urban centers, and although there were substantial differences in population density corresponding to an uneven topographic distribution of soil and hydrologic resources (see discussion that follows), the general trend was of dispersed households, each occupying and farming its own adjacent plots. Moreover, while the commoners were sedentary on their lands, the ali'i were known to move about in relation to available food stocks. This peripatetic pattern of chiefly movement is well described, and underlies the metaphor of the chief as a “shark who travels on the land” (He manōholo ̒āina ke ali'i; Pukui 1983:87: Proverb 799). Nonetheless, there were distinct chiefly and royal centers, marked by concentrations of larger residences adjacent to temples of the main state cults of Kū and Lono. [...] Surrounding the king's own extensive household compound were the residential courts of several principal ali'i and advisors, the houses of warriors, and the main Hale o Lono or temple to the god in whose name the annual tribute was collected. While this settlement plan has certain innovations reflecting Western contact (notably the gun drilling (p.51) field and the shipyard), in most respects it was probably typical of royal courtly centers in the late precontact era."

Only the kālaimoku had the regular privilege of holding secret meetings with the king, and he controlled the access of other al'i to royal audiences."

Ali'i-'ai-moku<div>"The districts (moku) into which the kingdom was divided were each under the control of a major chief of high rank, called the ali'i-'ai-moku. The operative term 'ai in this compound term has the core meaning of both 'food' and 'eat' but with metaphoric extensions connoting to 'consume,' 'grasp,' or 'hold onto' (Pukui and Elbert 1986:9). Thus the figurative extension of 'ai includes 'to rule, reign, or enjoy the privileges and exercise the responsibilities of rule.' The term ali'i-'ai-moku might thus be simply translated 'ruler of the moku,' but as in many Hawaiian expressions there are layers of kaona, 'hidden meanings', folded in. He is as well the chief who 'eats' the district (recall the metaphor of the chief as land shark), and literally 'eats from' its productions."

Thus the figurative extension of 'ai includes 'to rule, reign, or enjoy the privileges and exercise the responsibilities of rule.' The term ali'i-'ai-moku might thus be simply translated 'ruler of the moku,' but as in many Hawaiian expressions there are layers of kaona, 'hidden meanings', folded in.

Life literally depended on the continual transmission of mana from the gods to humans and earth, for mana was 'always linked to organic generativity and thus to all forces of growth and vitality' (Shore 1989:164).//But mana did not flow equally to all persons; quite the contrary, mana followed the pathways of rank and genealogical descent that also ordered Polynesian societies, and the more hierarchical these became, the more differentiated the distribution of mana across the social order. In all Polynesian societies, mana was concentrated in persons of rank, but in the more highly stratified societies the chiefs came to occupy particular roles as sources or vehicles of mana on which the society at large depended for its well-being. Nowhere was this more so than in late Hawaiian society. The Hawaiian divine kings, as gods on earth, were essential for the reproduction of society; they also held the power of life or death over the common people, most often exercised through the rites of human sacrifice. Death, as the polar opposite of life, is another aspect of mana." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_Hawaii3] NB This descriptive text refers to the period following European contact. The fact that certain elements of the ritual-religious system the Europeans encountered in Hawaii had probably been in place for a few centuries at first seemed sufficient to infer the presence of other elements, such as this one. However, this approach now seems too speculative.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "Clearly, the highest ranks of alii shared a number of attributes with the gods, and indeed were explicitly called alii akua or 'god-kings' (Valeri 1985a:143; Malo 1951:54; Kamakau 1961:4). Valeri (1985a: 142-53) discusses the ethnographic evidence for divine kingship in late Hawai'i, and I will reiterate only a few key points. As the ritual leader of his people, who intercedes with the gods to assure the flow of mana, the king 'instantiates different major gods or groups of their particularizations according to a precise ritual calendar' (1985a:142). Thus when he goes to war, the king offers a human sacrifice at the luakini temple of Ku, but at other times he consecrates temples to the agricultural gods Lono and Kāne. The king shares with these gods the right to the kapu moe, the prostrating kapu. Another sign of their divinity is the capacity of high-ranked alii to practice incestuous marriage, something that the gods provide the model for (as in the creation myth of Wākea and Papa, Beckwith [1940]). Gods and kings share other material insignia as well: the puloulou staff, and the wrapping of their bodies in feathered garments (see below). Holding the power of life or death over ordinary humans, the king is frequently described as the ultimate devourer, a shark (in particular, the tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvieri). [...] By the time of initial contact with Europeans, Hawaiians had taken the older Polynesian concepts of chiefship and rank, and subjected them to a form of hypertrophy, the logical extension of which was that their rulers, their kings, were now held to be divine."
