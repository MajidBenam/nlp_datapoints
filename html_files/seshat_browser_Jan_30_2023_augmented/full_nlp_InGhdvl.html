The rest of the empire can be grouped under the heads bhuati, mandala, zisaya, pathaka, chuturasitika and dvadesaka, bhukti was the biggest division. Next to it was the mandala. It was sub-divided into visayas; subdividion that we find also in feudatory States like Sakambhari. The pathaka stood next to it. The Varanasi Visaya had a division called Kasiparapathaka. .... it can be further concluded that the pathaka was a union of villages, the number of which could vary."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_InGhdvl] "The kotta or durga may be regarded as a representative of the durga constituent of a saptanga rajya.

Attached to it must have been a permanent office like the one a Pehoa which kept a record of transactions and agreements ... Its secretary might have been designated Karanika."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InGhdvl] An imperial officer, called tantrapala in a Harsa inscription of Vigraharaja II and some others, probably was tasked with "keeping the feudatories in check, looking after the interests of his master on the borders of his empire, and using diplomacy as well as force, to gain his objective. He was authorised also to make grants and sign important documents on behalf of his master."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InGhdvl] "The head of a visaya might have been known as the vasayapati but we have no idea of the titles used for the heads of the divisions lower than a visaya."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InGhdvl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Bhukti - Mandala - Visayas - Pathaka (union of villages) - Kotta/Durga? - Village[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Under chapter 9 "The Rajput Administration" pages 389-403 includes section on military administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InGhdvl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>From an essay on "The Rajput Administration".

We know from the narrative literature that it was easy to negotiate the moat and wall of the king’s palace by means of a pole or rope. The palace wall formed a police and not a military protection. Once besiegers had breached the city wall, the city lay at their feet. There was no last stand for the palace."".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_94_InGhdvl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Long walls ♣  ♥</b> km.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Modern fortifications ♣ absent ♥</b></div><h1><span id="Phase_II_Variables_(polity-based)"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Phase_II_Variables_.28polity-based.29">Phase II Variables (polity-based)</span></h1><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Institutional_Variables">Institutional Variables</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Limits_on_Power_of_the_Chief_Executive">Limits on Power of the Chief Executive</span></h3><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Power_distributed">Power distributed</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by government ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by non-government ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Impeachment ♣ ♥</b></div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Mobility">Social Mobility</span></h2><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Status">Status</span></h3><div><b>Elite status</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ elite status is hereditary ♣ present ♥</b> Gahadavala dynasty [MAJIDBENAM_REF_95_InGhdvl]</div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion_and_Normative_Ideology">Religion and Normative Ideology</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> “The magical power which pervaded the king at his consecration was restored and strengthened in the course of his reign by further rites, such as the ceremonial rejuvenation of the ‘’vajapeya’’ and the horse-sacrifice (‘’asvamedha’’, p. 42), which not only ministered to his ambition and arrogance, but also ensured the prosperity and fertility of the kingdom. Implicit in the whole brahmanic ritual was the idea of the king’s divine appointment, and though the rajasuya was replaced in later times by a simplified ‘’abhiseka’’, or baptism, the ceremony still had its magical flavour.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_96_InGhdvl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ present ♥</b> “Divinity was cheap in ancient India. Every brahman was in a sense a god, as were ascetics with a reputation for sanctity. Householders sponsoring and financing sacrifices were in theory raised to divinity, at least for the duration of the ceremony, while even sticks and stones might be alive with inherent godhead. Moreover the gods were fallible and capable of sin. If the king was a god on earth he was only one god among many, and so his divinity might not always weigh heavily upon his subjects.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_97_InGhdvl]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Equity_and_Prosociality">Normative Ideological Aspects of Equity and Prosociality</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ absent ♥</b> Caste system. "There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...] In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste.
