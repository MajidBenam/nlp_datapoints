As with other steppe polities, the term ‘‘tribe’’ was applied to groups that were part of the Khitan confederation but not necessarily ethnically Khitan.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_MnKhitn] "It may be more accurate to suggest that A-pao-chi took advantage of a political vacuum created by the gradual withdrawal of the Kyrgyz into their homeland in the Yenisei region.

The East Capital was near city of Liao-yang in the area of settlement of Bohai peoples. Two last capital cities were situated within the area of the Chinese people residence.

Under the leadership of Abaoji, the Khitan rapidly adopted a centralized royal form of organization, with clear similarities to Chinese traditions but also incorporating some of the familiar steppe pastoralist strategies (Wittfogel and Feng 1949, pp. 59-65). Although Buddhism was a central feature of the polity, as the empire expanded into Central Asia the majority of the population was actually Muslim (Biran 2006, p. 66; Dunnell 1996, p. 4)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Liao occupation of the Central Plains, 947"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Liao emperor did not conquer and govern the Central Plains directly. ... by dint of military success, he had become the legitimate emperor of the Central Plains. Familiar with T'ang protocols, and advised by formally educated ministers from both Liao and the Later Chin, Te-kuang observed such practices as declaring a new dynasty, wearing Chinese dress, and reemploying former officials. ... He appointed new governors, demoted K'ai-feng from its capital status, and established Chen-chou as a capital instead. But Te-kuang did not intend to stay. ... he treaded the conquest as a very large raid, in which public relations were irrelevant and only loot mattered. Perhaps most damaging to Te-kuang's image was the policy of "smashing the pasture and grain" (ta ts'ao-yu) ... The Liao armies devestated the region around the capital, foraging to supply themselves and practicing the all-too-common cruelties of soldiers in wartime. To reward his troops, claimed to number three hundred thousand, Te-kuang demanded from an already overtaxed population cash and cloth to be stockpiled for transport north. Most ambitious of all was Te-kuang's attempt to take north every material element of the Later Chin imperial institution, including palace women and eunuchs, the complete contents of the imperial storehouses, and every last bureaucrat. ... Te-kuang ... apparently wrote his younger brother listing his own three faults in this venture: demanding cash from the people. ordering indiscriminate foraging and plundering, and failing to return the governors to their provinces in good time. The letter, preserved in the Liao shih (Official history of the Liao), describes the "foreignness" of the Khitan: they are raiders (rather than tax collectors) and pastoralists (rather than farmers), and they keep their governors at court(rather than giving them active responsibility in their provinces)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Revolts against Liao: "Te-kuang, preoccupied with removing himself and his plunder north to the Liao homeland, was largely unresponsive to these events, although he did make an example of Hsiang-chou2, slaughting some hundred thousand men and children, and taking away the women." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Liao, for their part,did not vigorously defend the territory they had conquered. On the few occasions when they did fight, they did not try very hard."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The one region the Liao seemed concerned to hold was the key strategic city of Chen-chou, which controlled the main access between the Central Plains and the Liao homeland."

Cambridge.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The comitatus of the early Khitan, a Mongolic people, is known from the ac- counts of An Lu-shan’s Rebellion. For a detailed treatment of the later Liao Dynasty of the Khitan, including discussion of its imperial guard corps, see the outstanding early study by Wittfogel and Fêng (1949). “Each [Khitan Liao] emperor had a separate ordo, or camp, with a ‘heart and belly guard’ of 10,000 to 20,000 households. . . . The members of this guard, particularly the non-Khitans, were the emperor’s private slaves, but their proximity to him gave them high status. After the emperor’s death they guarded his mausoleum while his suc- cessor recruited a new ordo and guard” (Atwood 2004: 297). The Liao state, with its five capitals (ordo), seems to have been organized, theoretically, around the ideal of the “khan and four-bey” system. The khan of the Kereit, who were rivals of Temüjin during his rise to power, “had crack forces of ba’aturs, ‘heroes’, and a 1,000-man day guard, institutions Chinggis Khan would later imitate” (Atwood 2004: 296), along with the golden tent (ordo) connected to them."

The representatives of these clans were the first-rate proprietors in the country and held a major portion of the most important military and civil posts in the empire administration. Since the rule of the empire founder Apao-chi, the clan has been subdivided into two parts: Five or North Divisions and Six or South Divisions. These parts were governed by grand princes (wang). The family of the Kitans’ emperor was related to five divisions. The direct descendants of Apao-chi gave belonged to so called Horizontal Tents (hêng chang) while the descendants of two his uncles and brothers were known as Three Patriarchal Household (san fu fang). Jointly, they have formed four leading lineages (LS 73: 6b; Wittfogel, Feng 1949: 191-192)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The North part was considered to be higher than the South one by rank though, as for the administrative machine size and bureaucracy qualification, it ranks below the latter. The heartland of nomadic empire was headed by the Prime Minister of the Northern Administration (LS 1: 10b; Wittfogel, Feng 1949: 472) who, as a rule, has been appointed from the representatives of Yeh- lü and Hsiao clans. His competence included the most important affairs of state such as, for example, army control, supervision of the state sector of stock- raising business, participation in working out of the most important political decisions." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In accordance with the hierarchical principle of the steppe society organization, the nomads were divided into subdivisions by the decimal principle (Taskin 1979: 511-513). In this case, only a part of nomads has taken part in acts of war while the remaining warriors have always stayed put as the basis of a tribe (ibid: 426). The tribes being autonomous and independent formations before the Apao-chi accession to the throne have become main administrative units for a period of empire. Their duties included the following functions: [...] Second, the tribes were basic administrative-political units in the northern part of the country. Each tribe had its own particular territory for leading a nomad’s life. Each tribe had its own control organization being headed by a traditional chief (ilichin). A title of the tribal chief was transmitted hereditably. In the course of signification a pressure on the nomadic tribes has occurred.

T'ien-tso was demoted to the rank of a prince (it is for this reason that he was never granted a temple name). ' The Liao empire was now split: Tien-tso's authority, such as it was, was confined to the remote tribal areas of the far west. The territory controlled by Prince Ch'un was limited to the sedentary southern regions, and the Liao empire he ruled was reduced to a minor Chinese frontier state, its officials mostly Chinese, and the army, once almost entirely composed of Khitan tribesmen, now a motley mixture of Chinese troops and refugees from the east, under Khitan or Hsi commanders."

Above all, they resented his favorite Hsiao Feng-hsien's ability to prevent the emperor's hearing their own proposals or even from learning how truly desperate the situation was. In the spring of 1121 Lady Wen, the second wife of T'ien-tso and mother of the prince of Chin, conspired with her brother-in-law, General Yeh-lii Yii-tu, to depose the emperor and install her own son in his stead. The plot was uncovered by the emperor's favorite Hsiao Feng-hsien, who was the brother of a rival consort, Lady Yuan, and hoped to ensure the succession for one of her sons.

This practice fitted with the Khitans' widespread traditional use of hereditary succession (shih-hsiian) to office. Many offices were reserved for members of specific lineages of the Yeh-lii and Hsiao clans. Khitans were debarred from taking the Chinese examinations. Shortly after Sheng-tsung's death a prominent scholarly member of the imperial clan, Yeh-lii Shu-chen, was given two hundred lashes for allowing his precocious son to sit illegally for the chin-shih examination. The son was, nevertheless, employed and later gained preferment because he was also able to prove his mastery of a true Khitan skill, archery,' by killing three hares with three successive arrows." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_103_MnKhitn] "The southern commissioners were usually members of the Yeh-lii royal clan, the northern commissioners mostly members of the Hsiao consort clan. The administration of the Northern Region was mainly, though not exclusively, staffed by Khitan holding traditional Khitan titles. Its most powerful officers were the Khitan commissioners for military affairs, the prime ministers of the Northern and Southern administrations {Pei-fu tsai-hsiang, Nan-fu tsai-hsiang), the Northern and Southern Great Kings (Pei Ta-wang, Nan Ta- wang), both of whom were members of the royal clan, and the commander in chief {yu-yueh). These men controlled all military and tribal affairs, the selection of military commanders, the disposition of the tribal herds, and the allocation of pastures. Beneath them was a bewildering array of tribal officials, an office for the royal clan of the former Po-hai state, and a range of offices providing services to the imperial house: artisans, physicians, huntsmen, and commissioners responsible for the royal herds, stud farms, and stables. No one could possibly confuse the administration of the Northern Region with the orderly model of T'ang government. It was essentially a great tribal leader's personal retinue, and many of its offices were specifically reserved for members of one or another branch of the royal or consort clans and filled by hereditary selection (shih-hsiian)."

As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b>  The name of the research assistant or associate who coded the data.
