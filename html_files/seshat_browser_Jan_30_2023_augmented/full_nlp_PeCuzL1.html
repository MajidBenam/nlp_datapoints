[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"After AD 1000, the population of the Cusco Basin and Sacred Valley grew substantially, and the site of Cusco itself increased in size and population density." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The 1000-1250 CE period is before the Inca expansion into the Sacred Valley, which occurred during a time of drought dated 1250-1310 CE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_PeCuzL1] Administrative and temple buildings at Qhapaqkancha, Markasunay and Pukara Pantillijlla probably developed during the Inca expansion into the Sacred Valley (1250-1310 CE). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Another polity present in the Cuzco Valley during the Late Intermediate Period was the Pinagua polity based at Choquepukio in the Lucre Basin: "A few centuries later, circa AD 1300, a second building phase was initiated at Choquepukio, resulting in the construction of additional niched halls." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_PeCuzL1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b>Two main polities are known for this period; the Killke (Inca) and Pinagua of the Lucre Basin.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]For the Incas, chroniclers say earliest rulers had a small territory and lacked control over neighbouring groups. Mayta Capac* consolidated Inca control over the Cusco Basin. Military hierarchy increased from these times. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_PeCuzL1] *(c1290 CE)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Cuzco/Killke polity in the 1000-1200 CE period [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]influenced the Masca and Tambo regions[MAJIDBENAM_BR]had sustained interaction with the Chillque[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Paruro were possibly under Cusco domination [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_PeCuzL1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b>"The developing Inca polity is likely to have had direct control over, or close alliances with, some groups outside the Cuzco Valley even before it was completely consolidated." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PeCuzL1]"Inca alliances with a limited number of neighboring groups depended on the personal interactions of elite individuals who acted on behalf of small groups like the people of Huaro, as well as larger ethnic confederations like the Ayarmacas."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Pinagua-Moyna polity seems to have been the most powerful in the region before the reign of Inca Viracocha. These two groups jointly occupied the Lucre Basin and were likely the two moieties of a combined political unit. [...] Together with the Pinagua-Moyna alliance, the important settlements of Andahuaylillas, Huaro, and Urcos probably formed a powerful confederate mini-state, which was long able to prevent the Inca extension toward the east and Collao (Titicaca) region. It is noteworthy that these sites all contain the archaeological remains of major Wari occupations. This mini-state is very likely a fragment of the old Wari imperial structure." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_PeCuzL1]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supra-cultural_relations">Supra-cultural relations</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ PeWari* ♥</b> "their ascendancy began sometime after AD 1000, when they were just one of many highland societies jockeying for position following the decline of Wari and Tiwanaku." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_PeCuzL1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ [population migration; continuity] ♥</b> Linguistic and biological evidence suggests that Incas spoke Puquina and Aymara, and were genetically related to the altiplano populations. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_PeCuzL1]". Intriguingly, the Inca-era populace of the Cuzco area differs from earlier residents of the same zone; the latter group is biologically more closely affiliated with the Wari region. That evidence supports the idea that the Incas were latecomers to the Cuzco area, after ad 1000. Even so, they also found that some human remains recovered from Saqsawaman (just above Cuzco) had closer links to more northerly and coastal populations. They deduce from this evidence that there may have been some genetic mixing as a consequence of imperial programs (Shinoda in press). The complexity of this patterning emphasizes the difficulties of sorting out Inca history, whether political or biological. Overall, however, the suggestion that the Incas had a strong pre-imperial link to the Lake Titicaca area is far better supported now than it was a short time ago, even if we cannot quite argue that the issue is settled." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PeCuzL1] "Generally, there is little continuity between Cusco-dominated Wari Period styles and Killke period settlements, of which 83.5% (183/224) have no occupation from AD 400 to AD 1000." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_PeCuzL1]. However, another polity in the Cuzco Valley exhibited more continuity with the Wari: "The end of Wari occupation at Chokepukio is marked by the burial of some Wari temples and the complete razing of a number of very large buildings on the site. These were dismantled leaving only their foundations." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_PeCuzL1] "There is strong Wari cultural influence in the ceramics and architecture of the Late Intermediate Period at Chokepukio, suggesting a continuity of cultural elements after the collapse of the Wari Empire." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_PeCuzL1] Although it seems that the Killke and the Incas were not native to the zone, they might have been interpreted as genetically affiliated to the altiplano because of their conquest and subsequent mixing with the Lucre Basin Polity based at Choquepukio between 1300-1430 CE, as McEwan explains when referring to Choquepukio: "In a collaborative effort, Hiltunen and I (Hiltunen and McEwan 2004) have compared the archaeological evidence with the history given by Montesinos and suggest that descendants of the elite personages involved in the first migration to Cuzco later went on to found the Hanan (or upper moiety) of the Inca dynasty and united the various ethnic groups using K'illke ceramics, who were organized into the Hurin (or lower moiety)" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_PeCuzL1]. The Killke groups that mixed with the Lucre might have been a continuation of previous Cuzco quasi-polities.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ PeCuzL2 ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Wari cultural sphere ♥</b> The polity in the Lucre Basin (Pinagua) seems to have been in the Wari cultural sphere: "A few centuries later, circa AD 1300, a second building phase was initiated at Choquepukio, resulting in the construction of additional niched halls. Up to this point, the predominant postcollapse cultural influence had been derived from the Wari. The second building phase seems to represent the arrival of an elite group from the old Tiwanaku sphere of influence." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PeCuzL1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.  The Lucre polity was initially in the Wari cultural sphere: 320,000 km squared. The Killke polity could have been influenced by the Tiwanaku/Lake Titicaca cultural sphere, the extent of which  was 400,000 km squared in the Middle Horizon [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PeCuzL1] , so its later cultural influence could have been on a similar range.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Cuzco; Choquepukio ♥</b> 1000-1300 CE Cuzco became capital of the Killke polity. This has been confirmed by archaeological digs under Cuzco. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_PeCuzL1]Choquepukio was the capital of the Lucre Basin (Pinagua) polity. "Choquepukio was the most important settlement in the valley (McEwan 2006). Occupied by the Pinahua, it was quite an impressive town and may have even approached Killke-era Cuzco in scale and grandeur. Its ruins cover 60 ha on a low ridge and boast architecture bordering on the monumental - large stone enclosures and multi-storey buildings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Language</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ [Aymara; Puquina] ♥</b> "Linguists have recently arrived at the view that the Incas may have adopted Quechua for imperial rule precisely because it was already widespread. Before then, the Incas spoke one or two other languages, most likely Aymara and possibly Puquina." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_PeCuzL1] This refers to the pre-imperial Inca or Killke. The language used in other polities, such as the Pinagua of the Lucre Basin, seems to be undocumented.</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4><div>After the collapse of the Wari empire, the Cuzco valley once more underwent a phase of regionalization, known as the Late Intermediate Period (1000‒1476 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_PeCuzL1] In other valleys of Peru, this period saw the emergence of complex kingdoms such as the Chimu, the Chincha, the Ischma and the Chanchay.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Cuzco Valley, this period lasted from the early 11th century to the early 15th century and was characterized by incipient state formation in two areas. To the west, the Killke or K'illke  may have been the successors to the local Qotakalli chiefdoms of the Early Intermediate period and Middle Horizon.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_PeCuzL1] Centred around the location of modern Cuzco, where Killke material has been excavated,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_PeCuzL1] their sphere of influence extended south of Cuzco for around 20 kilometres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_PeCuzL1] Smaller undefended polities to the west of modern Cuzco may have been under Killke domination, while it is likely that the developing political units to the north were independent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Lucre Basin to the east, another powerful cluster emerged, referred to as 'Pinagua' or 'Pinagua-Moyna' by ethnohistorians. These polities developed around the sites of Choquepukio, Cotocotuyoc and Minaspata.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_PeCuzL1] They may have upheld the cultural legacy of Wari colonizers from the Middle Horizon,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_PeCuzL1] as their ceramics and architecture show profound Wari influence.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_PeCuzL1] Choquepukio in particular exhibits significant continuity with the Wari through its monumental architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_PeCuzL1] Even further to the east, another small state may have existed around the settlements of Andahuaylillas, Huaro and Urcos. It has been suggested that the Pinagua cluster and these polities together prevented the eastern expansion of the Killke until the late 14th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_PeCuzL1] Between these two extremities of the Cuzco Valley, the Oropesa Basin acted as a buffer zone.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Killke, centred in the Cuzco region, appear to have been the most influential and expansionary of these cultures during the Late Intermediate Period: their ceramics were widely used, in contrast to the limited spread of Lucre Basin styles.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Cuzco Basin and the Sacred Valley experienced significant population growth after 1000 CE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_PeCuzL1] although population estimates are extremely difficult to produce.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_PeCuzL1] The Lucre Basin cluster comprised at least 4 settlements extending over 10 hectares (e.g. Minaspata and Coto-coto), and Choquepukio covered 60 ha. These settlements may have housed several thousand people each.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_PeCuzL1] The capital of the Killke polity, now buried beneath modern Cuzco, may have covered 50 ha.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_PeCuzL1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Little is known about political organization at the beginning of the Late Intermediate period, but archaeological work has revealed that the Killke polity had a four-tiered settlement hierarchy[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_PeCuzL1] The second half of the Late Intermediate Period would lead to the consolidation of the Killke polity, to the detriment of the Lucre Basin.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_PeCuzL1] Eventually, the Killke elites laid the foundations of what would become the Inca empire.</div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Complexity_variables">Social Complexity variables</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner; Agathe Dupeyron ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [500-700] ♥</b> in squared kilometers.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>Map 1000-1200 CE "Territory of Cuzco Basin polity."

Speaking more generally, a chief's position often partly depends on his ability to control labor and its products, without owning the natural resources themselves. Since gift-giving advertises a chief's productive capacity, it can attract new adherents and create public obligations. Among the Incas, ritualized generosity may have helped to mediate political alliances and residential shifts among the Incas and their neighbors. Some authors also think that the manipulation of exchange obligations helped to underwrite the local rise of Inca power because their largess placed the recipients of gifts in an inferior social position (Rostworowski 1999:38-47)."
