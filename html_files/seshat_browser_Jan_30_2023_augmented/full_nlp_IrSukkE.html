the very diverse areas of the federation, the kings, being sovereign, strove to bind the minor princelings to themselves by ties of blood relationship. The result was a body politic constructed on lines that were unusual, complicated, and indeed unparalleled elsewhere. The ruling houses most adept at this task all seem to have sprung from the high land and not from Susiana, although Susa itself early attained the status of capital' (Hinz 1972: 69). ... Steinkeller described the six Shimaskian lands defeated by Shu-Sin as a 'confederation' (Steinkeller 1988a: 119), while Stolper called them 'an extensive interregional union' (Stolper 1982: 49)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Without exaggeration, the Elamite federated system of government can be considered as perhaps the earliest formal federalism on a large scale in history." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Elam's political structure was characterised by its confederate nature. This aspect was typical of the region from as early as the Early Dynastic period. Therefore, the role of the sukkal-mah corresponded to the Elamite confederation and the single sukkal correspond to the individual regional districts. Among these, the role of the sukkal of Elam and Shimashki maintained its privilege as a legacy of the former supremacy of the dynasty of Shimashki at the beginning of the second millennium BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrSukkE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supra-cultural_relations">Supra-cultural relations</span></h4><div>Below code cultural relations between the coded (quasi)polity and the preceding one, as well as those nearby.

This lead to the formation of a coalition between Mari and Babylon, along with their allies Larsa, Yamhad, Zalmaqum and all the kings in the Jezira. Within a few years, Elam was forced to retreat, although it still managed to plunder Eshnunna."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The documentation on Elam predominantly comes from Susa. The city had a central role as the residence of the sukkal-mah, but also a marginal one from an Elamite perspective due to its proximity to the Lower Mesopotamian border. Therefore, it is hypothetically possible that other Elamite regions and cities had a similar triad of offices, sharing the same sukkal-mah, but with different people in the other two roles."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"the Sukkal-mah Dynasty replaced the one of Shimashki perhaps as a repercussion of the incursion of Gungunum of Larsa against Susa.

During the Mari Age, the sukkal-mah (probably Shiruduh I) was engage in diplomatic and commercial relations with Mari and even more distant Qatna. ... Elam's influence extended all over the Zagros, reaching Shemshara, which was very close to Assyria. At the death of Shamshi-Adad ... the anti-Babylonian front along the Tigris was under the supremacy of Elam. Hammurabi's victory, however, helped in lowering the expansionistic ambitions ... The Babylonians never conquered Elam and the local dynasty continued to rule, leaving only Susiana vulnerable to the consequences of the military developments taking place in Mesopotamia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Just like in the rest of the Near East, even in the case of Elam there is a lack of documentation for the sixteenth century BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At the time of the sukkal-mah, the choice of Susa as capital showed a clear intention of becoming a constitutive part of the Mesopotamian political system and of Babylonian culture."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Babylonian official language at this time: "The official language (also for royal inscriptions) was once again Elamite, and not Babylonian, as it had been before the dark age."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Among the major administrative achievements of the Elamite Iran were the development and management of a gigantic system of underground irrigation, qanats, an earlier Iranian invention turning an unworked country into an agricultural land; the invention and development of the written language of Elamite and its extensive use in the administration of the federated state; and the construction and maintenance of numerous public enterprises like roads, bridges, cities and towns, communication centers, and economic trade centers with the neighboring states. Elamite Iran was relatively prosperous because of its rich minerals and precious metals, as well as other industries and arts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IrSukkE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The earliest experiences of state tradition and administrative functions on a massive scale began around 6000 B.C. in Susa. As one of the oldest sites of ancient civilization, Susa began political and administrative life first as a city-state contemporary and rival to Sumer in the Mesopotamia, then as the capital of one of the oldest empires of antiquity, Elam. Established in the late fourth millennium B.C., the Elamite Empire was the first Iranian experience in empire building and state tradition. ... the federated state of Elam practiced public administration ... The federal system of Elam was composed of several major kingdoms (the Kassite, the Guti, the Lullubi, Susiana, and Elamite), all being of the same racial group of the pre-Aryan people. The Elamite over-lordship in Susa was the main power of the federated states, the heads of which frequently assembled for political and military purposes.
