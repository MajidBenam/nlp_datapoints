[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The dating of the Killke era from ad 1000 until about 1400 is still based on relatively few radiocarbon dates, but they are consistent with one another (Dwyer 1971; Kendall 1985; Bauer 1992; Adamska and Michecsynski 1996). Carbon dates taken from Pumamarca architecture end in the fourteenth century (Hollowell 1987), while the Inca-style rectangular and ceremonial constructions at Pukara Pantillijlla are also earlier than we would expect from the historical chronology (Covey 2006b: 163). In light of the early dates, Bauer (1992: 47) has ventured that some structures usually thought to belong to the imperial era were actually raised during the Killke period. As noted in chapter 2 (section entitled “Time frames”), carbon dates suggest that the transition from the pre-Inca to Inca eras at Chokepuquio seems to have occurred 1400 - 30, which is in keeping with the idea of a late incorporation of the Lucre region."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"During the 14th century, the Inka state annexed new territory through increasingly protracted military campaigns. Local resistance or rebellions led to the territorial consolidation of the increasingly large parts of the Inka heartland, while long distance diplomatic contacts became more sustained and formalized."

Valcárcel (1934-5) made a major advance in understanding the early settlement through his extensive excavations in the early 1930s at that site. There, he recovered abundant ceramics, about one-quarter to one-third of which were later determined to be pre-imperial Inca (Killke style)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_PeInca*]  For the regions conquered outside of the Cuzco Basin, the previous polities are Late Intermediate Period polities.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity; cultural assimilation; population migration ♥</b> Wthin the Cuzco NGA, continuity: "Continuing studies by Peruvian archaeologists have recovered Killke pottery from at least seven more locations, distributed across an area that approximates imperial-era Cuzco. Their work in and around the Qorikancha has yielded exceptionally high-quality pottery (Bauer and Covey 2004: 77-8). The planning of parts of the early town apparently foreshadowed the imperial capital’s layout. Building foundations under the present-day Hotel Libertador were found to have orientations like those of nearby imperial masonry. From that evidence, we may infer that at least part of the most prestigious imperial layout overlaid an existing design. In turn, that suggests that there was some sort of conceptual continuity from the pre-imperial to imperial eras (González Corrales 1984; Hyslop 1990: 30-4)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_PeInca*] Outside the Cuzco NGA, the Incas conquered and either assimilated these polities culturally, as with the Chimu [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_PeInca*] or relocated groups inside these zones, as in the case of Cerro Azul [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_PeInca*].  Farrington mentions the presence of Killke pottery in urban excavations in Cuzco [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_PeInca*], but he explains the growth of the site in terms of a post-1438 urbanization project by Pachakutiq [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_PeInca*].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ EsHabsb ♥</b> Spanish Empire - Viceroyalty of Peru</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Cuzco ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PeInca*] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The city of Cuzco is the principal one of all those where the lords of this land have their residence; it is so large and so beautiful that it would be worthy of admiration even in Spain; and it is full of the palaces of the lords, because no poor people live there, and each lord builds there his own house, and all the caciques do likewise, although the latter do not dwell there continuously." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Language</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Quechua ♥</b> 160 different languages within the empire, 16 language groups.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PeInca*] "Drawing from historical linguistic and toponymic (place-name) evidence, some linguists suggest that the Incas probably spoke Aymara well into the early imperial era, since that was the language of the southern Peruvian highlands in late prehistory and Aymara place-names are even found as far north as the central Peruvian highlands (Adelaar and Muysken 2004; Cerrón-Palomino 2004, 2008; Heggarty and Beresford-Jones 2012; figure 2.6b). Quechua and Aymara speakers apparently interacted a great deal, to the extent that the two languages now overlap about 30 percent (e.g., in lexicons).6 Such a scenario raises the questions as to when the Incas adopted Quechua as their administrative language, and why. The leading Andean linguist today, Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino (2012), suggests that the shift may have occurred as late as the rule of Wayna Qhapaq, that is, no more than three or four decades before the Spanish.’ arrival, because its widespread use in the lands to the north made it an effective sociopolitical tool." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_PeInca*]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4><div>The Inkas or Incas were just one of the multiple chiefdoms competing for power after the collapse of the Wari and Tiwanaku polities of the Middle Horizon.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_PeInca*] And yet, they developed to become the largest indigenous empire in the Americas, known as Tawantinsuyu ('the four parts together').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_PeInca*] Growing from the Killke confederation, they started to expand in the Cuzco Valley and beyond over the late 14th and 15th centuries CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_PeInca*] Over a short period from 1480 to 1532, three successive rulers ‒ Pachakuti, Thupa Inka Yupanqui and Huayna Capac ‒ pursued an expansionary policy which saw the empire stretch from southern Colombia to central Chile, covering most of the Andes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_PeInca*] Its geographical extent may have covered between 500,000 and 2 million square kilometres,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_PeInca*] including dry coastal deserts, snow-capped mountains, and the fringes of the Amazon rainforest.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Because of their expansionary policy over huge swathes of land, the Inkas needed to establish adequate ruling strategies. They could exert indirect control through their hegemony over local allies. At Farfán in northern Peru, the blend of Chimú and Inka architectural styles may indicate that local elites were the vessel through which Inka rule was manifested.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_PeInca*] Over the areas they conquered by force, the Inkas established new settlements and imposed their own regional administrators. Near Cañete, they massacred the local Guarco population and installed their own colonists at the site of Cerro Azul.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_PeInca*] The dispersion and relocation of unruly people was one of their strategies to avoid uprisings, and could also serve to foster the empire's productivity. Indeed, resettled populations could be clustered to create specialized centres of production, such as the weavers and potters of Milliraya, Bolivia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In addition to these violent methods, however, the Inka elite used ideological strategies to create a sense of community among conquered populations. Inka art employed a uniform geometric style, easily recognizable throughout the empire. Apart from the fine textiles and metals crafted for the royal lineages by chosen craftspeople, the rest of their ceramics and textiles were mass-produced and mass-distributed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_PeInca*] This meant that Inka identity could be easily replicated and grafted onto existing cultures. The Inka 'package' included ceremonial vessels known as <i>k'eros</i> and <i>aribalos</i>,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_PeInca*] used to distribute maize beer or <i>chicha</i> in state-sponsored feasts. The Inkas also reused previously important ceremonial shrines (<i>wak'as</i>) ‒ Muyu Orco, for example, was revered from the Late Formative period to the arrival of the Spanish.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_PeInca*] ‒ and incorporated them into the network of shrines (<i>z'eque</i>) radiating outwards from Cuzco.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_PeInca*] Every year, important state rituals manifested this state ideology on an impressive scale: the Inti Raymi or solstice festival was a grand state ceremony lasting for eight or nine days.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_PeInca*] Cuzco acted as a great ceremonial centre with its sacred precincts; provincial administrators could be formally installed during the course of some of these rituals.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_PeInca*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The empire is also known for its elaborate infrastructure works. The royal highway, known as Qhapaq Ñan, was composed of two north/south axes linked by 20 east/west segments, and stretched over 40,000 kilometres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_PeInca*] Empire-sponsored storage facilities were located near every major town and village along the Inka roads. These units, known as <i>tampus</i>, were located no further than 15-25 kilometres apart,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_PeInca*] a distance that corresponds to a day's walk and facilitated the transport of armies and commodities throughout the empire.
