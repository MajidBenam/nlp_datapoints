Bologna and Perugia, deposing their lords and reincorporating them into the Papal State. Julius' pontificate furthermore was a highpoint of the Roman Renaissance, as he sponsored artists such as Rafael and Michelangelo; in addition to this, Rome in the first quarter of the sixteenth century was a major diplomatic and political hub.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_ItPapRn] This peak date should be bracketed, however, given that Julius was widely reviled during his own time (Erasmus wrote a famous dialogue between him and St. Peter, castigating Julius' worldliness) and by posterity as an excessively worldly pope. In addition, the almost completely secular orientation of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth-century popes was directly responsible for the Protestant Reformation, which would mark one of the greatest challenges to papal power the Church had ever faced.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Temporal_bounds">Temporal bounds</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1378-1527 CE ♥</b>The polity period begins with the return of the papacy to Rome, and ends with the Sack of Rome. Pope Urban V (r. 1362-70) attempted to return to Rome, but was driven out by the Romans and returned to Avignon in 1370.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_ItPapRn] The efforts of the papacy to return to Rome and the Patrimony were frequently stymied, and Urban VI's eventual success (1377-78) in returning to Rome provoked the Great Schism.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Alternate start: 1417. "popes in the century between ca. 1430 and 1530 concentrated their efforts on protecting their Italian domain and in lavishly reconstructing the city of Rome.

In general, the various lords, cities, and feudatories of the papal states were ready and willing to rebel when possible (for example, in 1375.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_ItPapRn]) Furthermore, the lords of the Romagna were <i>de facto</i> independent for much of the late 14th and early 15th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_ItPapRn] During the mid-15th century, King Ferrante of Naples deliberately contracted with Roman barons for them to raise mercenary bands for his service, undercutting these barons' feudal ties to the papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ItPapRn]Brackets are required to reflect the consolidation of papal authority in the papal states during the fifteenth century, and the ambiguous relationship between papally-appointed, clerical officials and the local elites they were theoretically superior to.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItPapRn] Peterson has characterized the Church by this period as bureaucratic and legalistic, especially in the administration of the papal state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> The period up to 1494 was marked by a lack of foreign interference in Italian affairs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItPapRn] As distinct from the 13th and most of the 14th centuries, the papacy was often free from domination by German emperors or Spanish kings, following the return to Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItPapRn] Brackets should be added to indicate the drastically changed situation between 1494-1527, following the French king Charles VIII's invasion of Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapRn]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supra-cultural_relations">Supra-cultural relations</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Rome - Republic Restoration Period ♥</b> <i>Cola di Rienzo's Revolution in Rome. </i>Nicholaus, severus et clemens, libertatis, pacis justiciaeque tribunus, et sacra Romana Reipublica liberator.<i></i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Papal States - Medieval Period I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Christendom ♥</b> However, during the period 1300-1450 CE "the idea of Christendom as a supranational entity toward which all Christians felt supreme loyalty and affection slowly collapsed. With the evolution of independent political and physical territories, soon to be called national monarchies or states, Christians began to choose between allegiance to state and devotion to church, and many chose the former. By the fifteenth century, the papacy ceased to function as a universal power and more and more like another regional Italian prince jealously guarding his fiefdom."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Rome ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Latin ♥</b> Latin remained the language of administration, culture, and intellectual life during this period.

Goldthwaite has argued that the papacy's return to Rome in 1378 inaugurated a phase of economic growth for the Rome and its hinterland, reflecting Rome's dependence on the papacy, and not Lazio's productivity, to stimulate the economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItPapRn] Before the sack of Rome in 1527 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItPapRn] the population had finally begun to grow again, from about 30,000 early in the 14th century to 55,000.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Renaissance Popes attempted to systematize and unify the financial administration of the Papal State. This meant ending financial and judicial immunities, and rolling back the power of locally powerful bishops and abbots.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItPapRn] However, the vast bureaucracy the Pope oversaw was a fundamentally corrupt one, by the late 14th century founded on bribery, the sale of offices, and patronage politics.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItPapRn] During the fifteenth century, the sale of offices within the <i>curia</i> became routinized; and Peterson has estimated that under Pope Leo X (1513-1521), two thousand offices were for sale in the city of Rome alone.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The papacy's ability to control the regions of the Papal States fluctuated dramatically during this period, especially during the Great Schism (1378-1417 CE). During the Schism, numerous ecclesiastical territories in the Papal State were seized by or alienated to secular lords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItPapRn] The 1380s and 1390s were characterized by a long and futile struggle between the Roman and Avignon popes for control of territory and finances in central and southern Italy, with the long-term result being the destabilization of central Italy and the intensified decentralization of power in the Papal State, especially in the Romagna and <i>le Marche</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In general, the various lords, cities, and feudatories of the papal states were ready and willing to rebel when possible, for example, in 1375 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapRn] Furthermore, the lords of the petty Lords known as the Romagna were <i>de facto</i> independent for much of the late 14th and early 15th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItPapRn] During the mid-15th century, King Ferrante of Naples deliberately contracted with Roman barons for them to raise mercenary bands for his service, undercutting these barons' feudal ties to the papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]As distinct from the previous centuries, up until 1494 CE the Papal States was usually free from influence of German emperors or Spanish kings,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItPapRn] but the drastically changed situation between 1494-1527 CE, following the French king Charles VIII's invasion of Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItPapRn]</div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Complexity_variables">Social Complexity variables</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 44,000 ♥</b>NB!: 40,000 is a very rough estimate, based on the firmer figure of 44,000 for the mid-17th century, when Ferrara was more or less securely a part of the Papal State. A lower figure seems more suitable for this period, when papal control over the papal states was less secure and often virtually non-existent due to schisms or rebellions.

Black's estimate would make the Papal State roughly equal to that of the Veneto: in the sixteenth century Venice and its Terrafirma were estimated to contain around one and a half million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItPapRn] Whereas the Veneto was mostly arable flatland in the Po River Valley, much of the Papal States was mountainous and contained dispersed or scarce population, so the total population may have been lower, especially in the immediate aftermath of the plague cycles of 1347-1349 and 1363-1364. Black has estimated that Italy as a whole had around 11 million people in 1500.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>ET</i>: McEvedy and Jones estimated that Italy as a whole had around 10,000,000 people in 1500 CE and 7,000,000 in 1400 CE after the Black Death "cut the population back by about a third."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItPapRn] The estimate we have for the preceding century is 300,000-1,500,000. 900,000 (mid-point figure) minus a third gives an estimate of 600,000 for 1400 CE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [25,000-33,000]: 1400 CE; 55,000: 1500 CE ♥</b> Rome remained the largest settlement in the Papal States during this period, although the population of the city plummeted drastically following the 1527 Sack of Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItPapRn] Partner[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItPapRn] has estimated a slightly lower population count for Rome around 1400, stating that its population was around 25,000 people.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [4-5] ♥</b> The papal palace complexes within Rome; Rome; large provincial cities (Bologna, Perugia); towns; villages[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Papal palace complexes: The papal palaces in Rome-especially the Lateran and the Vatican-contained increasingly large bureaucracies, especially after the end of the Schism in 1417 and the return of a single, unitary papacy to Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Rome: Rome contained between 30,000 and 55,000 people during this period, and was unquestionably the largest city of the papal states.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Large provincial cities: Bologna was the second city of the papal states in every way; next to Rome, it was the largest town, contained a venerable university, and was the socio-economic center of the Romagna region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. towns: Towns such as Ancona, Orvieto, or Terracina contained between 10,000 and 20,000 people, and often served as administrative centers for provincial government.</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. villages: Market towns or small towns such as Iesi in the Marche region; these often were little more than a population center with a market, parish church, and the local lord's castle.

Pope: The pope remained the head of a vast bureaucracy and leader of the papal state, despite ongoing weakness on the ground during the fifteenth century. Some popes, however, such as John XXIII and Julius II, were effective administrators and military leaders.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals and legates: The cardinalate had increased in number from 24 (the limit set by the Council of Constance, 1414-1418) to 35 by 1500 or so.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItPapRn] By this period, the cardinals were a fundamental part of papal elections and crucial to the politics of the papal states. Legates-often, themselves, cardinals-handled diplomatic business outside of the papal states.

The popes could occasionally intervene against these petty lords, but the Papal State would not attain internal cohesion and administration (to a limited extent) until the sixteenth century. Despite this internal weakness, the papacy was strong enough that the Papal State was one of the five guarantor powers of the Peace of Lodi (1454), which established an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between the Italian powers (the papacy, Florence, Milan, Venice, and the Kingdom of Naples).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_ItPapRn]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> Pope; Cardinals and legates; archbishops; bishops and abbots; parish priests and members of the religious orders; deacons.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Twelfth century preachers emphasized how much easier  was the monk’s path to salvation, and how much more difficult and full pf temptation was the same path for urban merchants.
