The shogun became a prize to control and the capital at Kyoto was devastated by war. The period is also known as the Onin War and the Age of the Warring States (which translated into Japanese becomes the Sengoku jidai or Sengoku Period).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_JpSengk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There was no central government. The daimyo, supported by their close kinsmen and vassals, often had an inner council to decide on matters of administration and military policy. Military administrators known as bugyo are known to have been employed in a non-fighting capacity.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The dominant territory (kokka) was not defined by the borders of the traditional kuni (province) and was split into fiefs which the daiymo either directly maintained or controlled through a vassal. At times the daimyo made alliances with each other in the quest for more power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_JpSengk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Despite the turmoil the population during this period probably increased by five million over 100 years to about 20 million in 1568 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Complexity_variables">Social Complexity variables</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 15,000 ♥</b> in squared kilometers.

It tells the story of the birth of the kami, especially the birth of Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the Japanese imperial family - and by extension the Japanese people - are descended. The narrative tells of how Ninigi no Mikoto, grandson of Amaterasu Omikami, was sent to establish sovereignty over the Japanese islands. It was Ninigi’s great grandson, Jimmu, who became, according to the narrative, the first emperor of Japan. All Japanese emperors are said to descend from this sacred line beginning with Amaterasu. The three regalia - mirror, sword, and jewel - the symbols of imperial ruling authority, are said to have originated with Amaterasu who started the tradition of passing these symbols to each subsequent ruler. In the medieval and early modern periods (in fact, up until 1945), this Kojiki narrative was used to argue the legitimacy of the imperial family as rightful rulers."

And since “the ‘’kami’’ are like humans, emperors too have been human to most Japanese” and, throughout history, “there have been many folktales pointing to the humanness of the emperors”, for example ones centering on an eighteenth-century crown-prince’s love for soba noodles [MAJIDBENAM_REF_104_JpSengk].</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Equity_and_Prosociality">Normative Ideological Aspects of Equity and Prosociality</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ present ♥</b> "The primordial Shinto ethos seems to have been essentially egalitarian."

Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_108_JpSengk]  According to Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_109_JpSengk] “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_110_JpSengk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.
