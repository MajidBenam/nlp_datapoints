♣ unitary state ♥</b>This is contested between two main positions among scholars. The first assumes that empires and centralization happen together, and is based on an uncritical reading of the main source for the period, the Arthashastra. The source is from the perspective of elites in the imperial centre, and may be overstating the efficiency of the state. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InMaury]. The work of Gerard Fussman instead presents an argument that the empire could not have been centralized based on both the size and the technology of communication avaliable at the time. This argument is further bolstered by the presence of non-literal translations of edicts in local administrative languages. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_InMaury] As with most questions of this nature, the empire was in parts centralized, and part autonomous. It was a large metropolitan state with an outward looking elite overseeing with varying degrees of success over a large and in no way homogeneous collection of functionaries at both the provincial, district and village level connected together through a central vision originating with the King.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supra-cultural_relations">Supra-cultural relations</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Nanda Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Shunga Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Hinduism ♥</b> Note on Asoka's Buddhism: "the distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism in India was purely sectarian and never more than the difference between saivism and vaishnavism. The exclusiveness of religious doctrines is a Semitic conception, which was unknown to India for a long time. Buddha himself was looked upon in his lifetime and afterwards as a Hindu saint and avatar and his followers were but another sect in the great Aryan tradition. Ashoka was a Buddhist in the same way as Harsha was a Budhist, or Kumarapala was a Jain. But in the view of the people of the day he was a Hindu monarch following one of the recognized sects. His own inscriptions bear ample withness to the fact. While his doctrines follow the middle path, his gifts are to the brahmibns, sramansa (Buddhist priests) and others equally. His own name of adoption is Devanam Priya, the beloved of the gods. Which gods? Surely the gods of the Aryan religion. Buddhism had no gods of its own. The idea that Ashoka was a kind of Buddhist Constantine declearing himself against paganism is a complete misreading of India conditions. Asoka was a kind or Buddhist Constantine declearing himself against paganism is a complete misreading of India conditions. Asoka was essentially a Hindu, as indeed was the founder of the sect to which he belonged."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_InMaury]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 1,700,000 ♥</b>km squared.

Following the conversion of King Ashoka to Buddhism, Sanskrit was of increasing importance. Greek and Aramaic translations of edicts also indicate a reliance on local languages. There was no common language to unify the entirety of India. This lack of a common language was somewhat mitigated by the use of two different written scripts, the Brahmi and the Kharoshthi. The regional dialects of prakrit and limited surviving examples makes estimates largely speculative.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InMaury]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4><div>The Maurya Empire was one of the first geographically extensive empires in South Asia. The formation of the Mauryan Empire coincided with the invasion of India in the North-West of the armies of Alexander of Macedon in 327 BCE, most likely from territory in the Punjab.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]From circa 322 BCE until 187 BCE, the Mauryas extended their control over almost the entire subcontinent excluding Sri Lanka and the southernmost coast, as well as expanding northwest in Afghanistan.The exact origin of the empire is not clear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InMaury] The empire was built on the earlier model of the Nandas. The first three rulers, Chandragupta (324/321 BCE-297 BCE), Bindusara (297 BCE-273 BCE) and Ashoka (268 BCE-232 BCE) oversaw the main period of expansion and codification of the imperial state, with subsequent rulers attempting to preserve the gains made by the first three Kings until 187 BCE. Evidence of diplomacy between the Alexandrian successor state and the Mauryas Empire exist, though whether this was extensive is unclear.  Exact details of when the conquests of territory took place are also murky, but evidence seems to indicate that the majority took place under the founder King Chandragupta.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The reign of Ashoka was a period of stability and marked the peak of the empire, as well as religious reform. The Maurya Empire entered a period of decline and instability following his death, with weak rulers overseeing a quickly fragmenting state facing outward invasion by Bactrian Greeks. Brihadratha would be the last ruler of the Maurya dynasty, killed by his military commander Pushyamitra in 187 BCE. The commander would be the founder of the successor state of the Shunga Dynasty. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The King was the head of state, he controlled the military and  the bureaucratic administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Empire was organized under a large bureaucracy and divided into four provinces named after the cardinal directions. Each province had a separate hierarchal administration, with the system duplicated at the capital to oversee the empire. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A unique account of the Mauryan imperial administration  is preserved in The Arthasastra. A handbook  for governance which outlines a module of centralized government, although whether it is descriptive or an idealized version of the administration  is disputed. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population estimates for this period vary widely ranging from 18,000,000 to 100,000,000. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_InMaury] The Imperial Capital, Pataliputa was the largest settlement with an estimate of 50,000 inhabitants provided by (Clark 2013, 159).

Although the dynasty succeeded in holding vast territory through its military power and refined ruling structure, it was probably almost impossible to constitute a united empire controlled by central government due to the absence of an efficient communicate network and the great diversity of regional traditions. It is more likely that Mauryan rule in the provincial areas was primarily a supervisory role which remained at the upper level. The main concern in the provincial areas was extracting revenue from existing resources to enrich the core region (i.e. the lower Gangetic Valley) rather than changing local societies to establish unified rule in the empire. Although the Mauryas could possibly have had direct control over a few key locales such as Amaravati/Dhamnakataka, the remaining areas, which most probably retained their megalithic culture, may have been beyond their concern, may have been beyond their concern. In short, the Mauryan imperial expansion did not cause immediate and fundamental social changes in the lower Krishna valley."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InMaury]<div>Mauryan Empire: "more recent scholarship has emphasized the discontinous geography of the empire and the internal variability in its administration ... In particular, Mauryan territories in the Deccan and south India appear to have been quite limited, restricted to areas near important mineral resources, especially gold sources along the Tungabhadra River and in the Kolar region of south India. Asokan inscriptions are rare in the western and eastern Deccan areas where the Satavahana polity emerged (... though Satavahana and Mauryan inscriptions co-occur at Sanchi, Amaravati, and Sannathi). Other than Asokan inscriptions and some rare trade wares, these areas contain little direct evidence of the Mauryan presence, and no evidence of the form that presence may have taken. ... claims for its universal status and highly centralized political structure appear to have been overstated."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InMaury]</div></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [18,000,000; 100,000,000] ♥</b>  Expert dispute.

In particular, Mauryan territories in the Deccan and south India appear to have been quite limited, restricted to areas near important mineral resources, especially gold sources along the Tungabhadra River and in the Kolar region of south India. Asokan inscriptions are rare in the western and eastern Deccan areas where the Satavahana polity emerged (... though Satavahana and Mauryan inscriptions co-occur at Sanchi, Amaravati, and Sannathi). Other than Asokan inscriptions and some rare trade wares, these areas contain little direct evidence of the Mauryan presence, and no evidence of the form that presence may have taken. ... claims for its universal status and highly centralized political structure appear to have been overstated."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"We have a very detailed account of the structure and functions of Mauryan imperial bureaucracy in both Kautilya's Arthasastra and from the inscriptions of emperor Asoka. ...

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Mauryan empire was not a homogeneous whole. It was made up of three concentric areas. The administration consisted of a metropolitan centre, core territories undergoing state formation, and  peripheral areas with a number of pre-state societies. It is therefore the case that the administrative levels and level of delegation most likely varied greatly, but in all cases was essentially exploitative. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kautilya's Arthasastra and the Asoka inscriptions agree on "about two or three top levels in central administration; a minister or ministers called Mantrin (Kautilya) or Mahamatra (Asoka); a council of ministers at the next level (Mantri parishad), and many top officers and public servants variously called Amatyas or Sachivas, in a clear hierarchy. These three levels were retained with slightly changed names in the later Gupta Empire in the fifth century A.D. and under Harsha in the seventh century. The general of the army was also a Mantri of equal status, as were the viceroys or Kumaras of the four large regions or provinces of the Mauryan Empire. ... The central administrative structure was generally replicated in the regions or provinces governed by viceroys. These were subdivided into divisions and districts. The district has continued to be the nerve center of field administration today. The district officer then called Pradeshtri or Sthanika seems to have been much the same as his present day counterpart. He combined revenue collecting and magisterial duties and supervised the work of other technical or clerical officials (Yuktas) as well as village government under the Gopa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/>_Notes for other polity sheets_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"This bureaucratic system founded by Kautilya, Chandragupta, and Asoka was adopted by the successor empires of the Guptas, and Harsha with minor changes of name and substance."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_InMaury][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Guptas in the North and the Cholas in the South made a sophisticated system of village self-government an integral part of the administrative system.

Numerically they were inferior, but in wisdom and justice excelled all others. The most important amongst the Amatyas were the Mantrins or High Ministers corresponding to Mahamatras of Asoka’s time... The king consulted these High Ministers in formulating any kind of administrative measure. They were also summoned along with the Mantriparishad in emergency. They exercised a certain amount of control over the imperial princes, assisted the king in selecting Amatyas and sometimes accompanied the king in battlefield. In addition to the Mantrins there was the Mantriparishad or Council of Ministers which the king was bound to consult along with the Mantrins in times of emergency. The king was guided by the decision of the majority. ’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_196_InMaury] ‘The Council of Ministers or mantra-parishad existed in the administrative machinery of Asoka, but remained in sufferance as the final decision depended on the king and the latter regarded it as nothing more than an advisory body. A council whose members were personally selected by the king could do nothing but to remain as an ornamental facade in the administrative machinery. “The position of the ministry was not so much stabilised then as to curb his personal authority in the matter of administration and administrative changes. He lionised the entire field. If the ministry played any part, it was a minor one - the second fiddle”.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_197_InMaury] The following is from the Arthashastra and is advice directed to ministers dealing with kings who die unexpectedly: ‘The minister shall thus avert the calamities in which the king is involved; long before the apprehended death of the king, he shall, in concert with his friends and followers allow visitors to the king once in a month or two (and avoid their visits on other occasions) under the plea that the king is engaged in performing such rites as are calculated to avert national calamities, or are destructive of enemies, or capable of prolonging life or of procuring a son. On appropriate occasions, he may show a pseudo-king not only to the people, but also to messengers coming from friends or enemies; and this (false) king shall make the minister his mouth-piece in conversing with them as deserved. And through the medium of the gate-keeper and the officer in charge of the harem, the minister shall (pretend to) receive the orders of the king. Displeasure or mercy to wrong-doers shall be shown only indirectly. ..

The face of a Bráhman convict shall be branded so as to leave a mark indicating his crime:--the sign of a dog in theft, that of a headless body in murder; that of the female part (bhaga) in rape with the wife of a teacher, and that of the flag of vintners for drinking liquor.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_207_InMaury] “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_208_InMaury] Jainism: “The ethos of storing up merit leads to all manner of positive charitable activities, for which the Jain community is justifiably famous. But all such activities are ultimately in the service of spiritual liberation. To give, for a Jain layperson, is actually a mentally purifying act - a mini-renunciation - in preparation for the ultimate renunciation for which the layperson hopes eventually to be ready - if not in this life, then in a future rebirth.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_InMaury] Asoka’s edicts: “There is no higher duty then the welfare of the whole world. And what little effort I make is in order that I may be free from debt to the creatures, that  I may render them happy here and they may gain heaven in the next world.”’... The new ideas of social and moral ethics which Asoka infused into Buddhism were in keeping with his idea of adapting a new religion to contemporary needs during a period of political and economic transition. Instead of appealing to the narrow sectarian religious interests, he stressed the conscious aplication of pristine virtues of humanitarianism in social behaviour. In the complex cultural milieu of the third century B.C., Asoka inculcated the true meaning of Dhamma - man’s responsibility to his fellow human beings.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_210_InMaury]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> Buddhism generally: “Leading a moral life is seen as having a wider social dimension as well.
