A trade route from Guabba ran east to the Karun River and beyond (the region of Susiana). The route was also used for the transport of troops.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_117_IrSukkL] The Achaemenids (from c500 BCE?) possessed possibly the first large-scale militarised naval force[MAJIDBENAM_REF_118_IrSukkL] (one imagines largely based in the Mediterranean but presumably also some craft in the Persian Gulf) - the fleet consisted of over 600 tiremes that had 170 oarsmen and 30 fighters.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_119_IrSukkL] Have not found any earlier reference to naval operations occurring on the Persian Gulf that would require fighting ships. Did the Achaemenid fleet come out of nowhere or did it have some smaller-scale precedents in the Neo-Elamite civilization or Sumerian before that?
