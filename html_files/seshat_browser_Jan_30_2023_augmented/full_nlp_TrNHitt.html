whose rulers became tributaries of Assyria." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Neo-Hittite period can be divided into two main phases, as suggested by Mazzoni ([1995] 189). The first phase covers the period from the 12th century to the mid 9th century B.C. This period is characterised by the rise of kingdoms each centred on a town. Some of these towns were new foundations, but some were refoundations of earlier urban centres now embellished with monumental iconography. The second period covers the ca. 150 years from the mid 9th century to the Assyrian conquest in the late 8th century B.C. This phase saw the growth of centres and also an increasing concern for security expressed in the building of fortified strongholds throughout the region."

The population of the region was very likely a predominantly Luwian one, as it had been throughout the Late Bronze Age and perhaps already in the early second millennium."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrNHitt] "In the post-Bronze Age era, Hittite cuneiform disappeared entirely. There is not the slightest trace of it in any of the Iron Age successor-kingdoms of the Hittites.

The primary region of the Syro-Hittite kingdoms was however in Syria. The small states lasted for almost 500 years and were culturally and politically prominent from c900 BCE until the last of them fell to the Assyrian king Sargon II between 717-708 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrNHitt] The cultural links between these kingdoms and the Late Bronze Age Hittite Empire can be seen in the iconography and architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 1180-900 BCE post-Empire period the region reorganized into city-states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrNHitt] The earliest written records suggest there was no kind of federation, "each was entirely independent from the others, each had its own autonomous ruler."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrNHitt] The label 'Neo-Hittite' applies to 15 states spread through south-eastern Anatolia and northern Syria.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrNHitt] Those present in the area around or on the Konya Plain were the following: Pisidia; Pamphylia; Lycaonia; Tabal; Cilicia (Hilakku and Que).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although there was some continuity with the preceding period major cultural changes occurred in the Neo-Hittite era. According to Bryce (2012) "Hittite cuneiform disappeared entirely. There is not the slightest trace of it in any of the Iron Age successor-kingdoms of the Hittites. One might reasonably suppose that along with the disappearance of the written language, Nesite also disappeared as a spoken one." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrNHitt] Although we do not have any historical records associated with this epoch, historians have speculated that the society of this era used the Hieroglyphic Luwian language.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrNHitt] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrNHitt] I. Yakibovich has suggested that the core area of Luwian population was located in central Anatolia, in the region of the Konya Plain.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Many Neo-Hittite rulers took the titles "Great King" and "Hero" and it is likely an administrative centre existed in the central town.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrNHitt] At the better known Neo-Hittite site of Carchemish, in western Anatolia, a central bureaucracy is known which had scribes, clerks and other officials[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrNHitt]; although "Carchemish and probably Malatya apparently continued from their Late Bronze Age predecessors with little or no interruption"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrNHitt] which might not be the case for other lesser-known polities of the Neo-Hittite states.</div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Complexity_variables">Social Complexity variables</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Marika Wałęga; Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [300-700] ♥</b>"The Neo-Hittite states varied considerably in size, from a few to several hundred square kilometres.

Westwards, it extended to the Konya Plain, encompassing the sites now known as Kizildag and Karadag. The region had been integrated into Hittite territory, probably very early in Hittite history, and served as a kind of southern and south-western buffer zone to the Hittite homeland."

Neo-Hittite state of 700 km2 * 44.4 density per km2 would provide an estimate of about 30,000. However, the Neo-Hittite states were no doubt based around the larger urban areas so this could be a bottom line figure. Considering that there would need to be 100 such states in the region of Turkey to reach the 3 million population figure (for Turkey - see McEvedy and Jones estimate) this "bottom line" figure may be too low. 3 million split among, say, 15 states in Turkey as a whole would give us 200,000 per polity. This seems closer to a reasonable range of perhaps 80,000-160,000.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Turkey contained 3 million "during the course of the full Bronze age".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [12,000-18,000] ♥</b> 18,000 if we use Carchemish as an outside of NGA analogue at 200 per 90ha.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Carchemish (outside NGA region unless Carchemish had some control over Konya Plain region in early period)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The area enclosed by the outer wall covered more than 90 ha, which made it the largest urban centre in the region."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 3 ♥</b>1.
