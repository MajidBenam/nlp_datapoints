[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br/><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 1030 CE ♥</b> {1050 CE; 1010-1030 CE} The German Emperor Henry III, <i>de facto</i> guardian of the papacy and the Patrimony, granted the city of Benevento to Pope Leo IX.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItPapEM] This marked the definitive end of an independent polity centered on the city of Benevento, which had threatened the Patrimony for several centuries from the south (this Lombard menace, from north and south, was the original reason for the Frankish descent into Italy and the Frankish conquest of the Lombard Kingdom of Italy). It also was the furthest extent of (nominal) papal power until Pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216) began consolidating what would become the Papal States.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapEM] The period from 1036 to 1066 was characterized, however, by internal warfare and Salian invasions (despite the short-lived expansionist respite of 1049-1054 ending after Civitella). Thus, it could be argued that the real peak of the polity was under the Tusculan Reform Papacy c.1012-1036 CE because of internal and external stability, and socioeconomic and (even if limited) demographic expansion.

During his pontificate, the papacy began consolidating its control over Lazio and expanding its power through what would become the Papal States; simultaneously, Innocent III brought papal authority to its medieval height, initiating several crusades and presiding over the Fourth Lateran Council.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b>  In general, this period was marked by a high degree of fragmentation and sub-regional autonomy, with various areas of the Patrimony of St. Peter virtually independent of the Papacy or subject to central powers in a very nominal way.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItPapEM] Papal sovereignty over central Lazio was rarely in question,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItPapEM] yet the papacy's ability to control subject cities and defend its territory from outside threats was often minimal, particularly in regard to territory on the fringes of papal control.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItPapEM] For example, the city of Gaeta, in the extreme south of Lazio, was <i>de facto</i> independent of the papacy by the early 10th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItPapEM] In the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the papacy was frequently at war with the German emperors, causing serious destabilization of political authority in the Patrimony. I should emphasize, however, that it is difficult to pin down which of these terms is most accurate, since the papacy frequently entered alliances during this period, and significant parts of the Patrimony were <i>de facto</i> annexed by the Empire for decades at a time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥</b> Papal relations with other polities fluctuated dramatically during this period; I coded it as "vassalage" to reflect the fact that the papacy during this period was often dominated by the German emperors.</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Supra-cultural_relations">Supra-cultural relations</span></h4><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Rome - Republic of St Peter I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Papal State I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Latin Christendom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 17,000,000  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Rome ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Latin ♥</b> Latin remained the sole language of administration, diplomacy, liturgy, and culture throughout the period.

The population of Rome languished at a relative historical low of 35,000 people throughout this period, which was marked by a high degree of fragmentation and sub-regional autonomy. Various areas of the Patrimony of St. Peter were virtually independent of the Papacy or subject to central authority only in a very nominal way.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Through the 904-1198 CE period the polity, with its capital at Rome, was dominated by powerful families and a powerful foreign state. The Theophylacti, a noble family from Tusculanum, were the first of a number of aristocratic families who dominated the papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItPapEM] In the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the papacy was frequently at war with the German emperors, which caused serious destabilization of political authority in the Patrimony.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItPapEM] The German Emperor Henry III, became the <i>de facto</i> guardian of the papacy and the Patrimony.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]When Henry III granted the city of Benevento to Pope Leo IX this marked the furthest extent of (nominal) papal power until Pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216 CE) began consolidating what would be called the Papal States.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItPapEM]  It could be argued that the peak of the polity was under the Tusculan Reform Papacy c.1012-1036 CE because of internal and external stability and socioeconomic and (even if limited) demographic expansion.</div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Complexity_variables">Social Complexity variables</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 14,000: 1000 CE; 6,000: 1100 CE ♥</b>14,000: 900 CE; 14,000: 1000 CE; 6,000: 1100 CE.  This is Wickham's figure for the <i>territorium Sancti Petri</i>, the fundamental core of the Duchy of Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItPapEM] The second figure is Wickham's estimate for Rome's territory after it had lost effective control of the rest of Lazio, during the crises of the late eleventh century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItPapEM] We need to remember, however, that the claims of the papacy were far wider, extending as they did from Rome's territory (<i>contado</i>) all the way up to the Po River Delta. 14,000: 1000 CE = inferred data.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [300,000-1,250,000]: 1000 CE; [300,000-1,115,000]: 1100 CE ♥</b>  Inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>ET</i>: [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItPapEM]  Estimated from McEvedy and Jones "Italy" which had 5,000,000 in 1000 CE and 5,750,000 in 1100 CE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItPapEM] Figures divided by three to roughly approximate population ruled by this polity would be 1,666,000: 1000 CE; 1,916,000: 1100 CE.  The "Latium: Medieval Era (500-1500 CE)" coding page currently estimates the population of the Latium region only as: 335000: 904 CE; 110000: 1422 CE. These estimates for Latium conflict with the crude estimates based on the McEvedy and Jones figures for the whole of Italy since the latter do not drop from 850-1450 CE, they rise. Therefore I will assume the increase in population occurred outside of the region of this polity (Milan, Venice, Florence, Genoa?) and within this polity the population dropped, the initial McEverdy and Jones totals divided by 4 and 5 respectively.The population of the modern administrative region of Lazio currently stands at around 5,557,2756. This follows the massive improvement of living conditions after World War II.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItPapEM] I second the opinion expressed in the "Population" sub-section, however: there is virtually no information in the scholarship (English, French, even Italian) on the demographics of Lazio as a whole for the medieval period. Karl Julius Beloch's <i>Storia della Popolazione d'Italia</i> (1937-1961; Italian trans. 1994) remains the best account of Italian demographic patterns, but the section on the Papal States does not begin until around 1500.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ 35,000: 1000 CE; 35,000: 1100 CE ♥</b>40,000: 900 CE; 35,000: 1000 CE; 35,000: 1100 CE; 35,000: 1200 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItPapEM] Rome's population hovered around 35,000 for much of the pre-Black Death (1348) period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItPapEM]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 5 ♥</b>1.

Responsible for maintaining clerical discipline and for overseeing the property of the church, he was answerable only to the pope. Only he could perform all the sacraments; he alone performed the sacrament of confirmation and by the sacrament of ordination passed on his power to others. Theoretically, canon law held that he would be elected by the clergy and people of his diocese. In practice, he was elected only by the canon priests attached to the cathedral. Considered high clergy, the canons aided the bishop in furthering his agenda, administering the diocese and performing rituals at the cathedral church. At their head was the dean, the highest officer in the diocese. A diocesian chancellor supervised the cathedral school and issued licenses allowing clerics to teach and preach in the diocese. A treasurer oversaw finances, while a precentor managed the choir and organized the cathedral's musical program. Each diocese was divided into administrative districts, over which presided the archdeacons. Practically, these were powerful men; they were the bishop's legates, charged with enforcing discipline among the lower clergy, and therefore they were often quite unpopular. ...

There were clearly several such leaders at anyone time, as the Liber Pontiﬁcalis makes clear in, for example, its account of the contested papal election of 855, and other senior military ﬁgures sometimes appear, such as Cesario (son of Sergio magister militum), ordinatus super exercitum in 849. A hierarchy of rank appears earlier in 855, when Daniele magister equitum accused Graziano, eminentissimus magistro militum et Romani palatii (or Romanae urbis) superista, clearly his superior, of disloyalty to the Carolingians, a charge he could not sustain. Apart from this, however, the structure of the military side of Rome’s aristocratic hierarchies is obscure to us. A set of military offices appear in a wide array of heterogeneous texts, but we cannot put them into a credible ordering. We can say, however, that it was normal to call senior military men nobiles, and Cesario di Sergio’s case shows that they had hereditary elements; we shall see in a moment how complex links between families were by 876. The terminology just outlined becomes much less common after the beginning of the tenth century, perhaps because the supreme military leaders were by now Tefilatto and his heirs; but two people are called superista under Alberico, and Otto III brieﬂy revived the ofﬁce of magister militiae. Formal military ofﬁces cease to be documented at all after that.
