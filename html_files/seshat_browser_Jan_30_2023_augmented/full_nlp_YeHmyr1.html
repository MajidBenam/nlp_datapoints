The Himyarites used Sabaic in their inscriptions "yet frequently made mistakes and introduced alien words and foreign grammatical features which presumably derived from their own spoken languages."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_YeHmyr1] "Sab. became the official language of the Himyarites, and its use was expanded to most parts of the southern highlands. There is no doubt, however, that Sab. was not the Himyarites' vernacular."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_YeHmyr1] "Sab. is the only ESA language for which a widely acknowledge periodization was established. Its history may be subdivided into archaic (1st millennium B.C.E.), middle (1st c. B.C.E.-late 4th c. C.E.). and late or monotheistic, up to late 6th c. C.E.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_YeHmyr1] Hitti says the Himyarite language "was practically the same as that of the Sabaeans and Minaeans before them."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_YeHmyr1] The Himyarite's "linguistic cousins" were Ethiopian. This is in contrast to the northern Arab nomads.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_YeHmyr1] "South Arabian (or South Arabian Epigraphic) is the term used to designate the South Arabian inscriptions. It was comprised of four dialects: Sabaean was spoken in the Marib region, Minean spoken in the Wadi al-Jawf, Qatabanian in the Wadi Bayhan, and Hadramautic in the Wadi Hadhramawt. While they are usually classified as a Semitic language with close ties to Arabic and the languages of Ethiopia, they also show affinities with Ugaritic and Aramaic, ancient languages spoken in the Levant. The phonological system is nearly identical to Arabic (with the addition of one or more phonemes), and like Hebrew and Arabic, it is formed morphologically on consonantal root patterns. The origins of the Sabaean alphabet are now thought to be in the Fertile Crescent, though why or how it spread to South Arabia remains a mystery. With the arrival of Islam to South Arabia in the seventh century CE, Classical Arabic replaced these written languages, and spoken Arabic generally survived in only a few isolated pockets in what are today known as the regions of Mahrah (in southern Yemen and Oman) and the island of Socotra."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_YeHmyr1]</div><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Description">General Description</span></h4><div>In 115 BCE the Himyarites were a tribe from the southwestern highlands of Yemen. They formed, with Saba, the dual kingdom of Saba and Dhu-Raydan[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_YeHmyr1] after the Roman attacks in 25 BCE emboldened the Himyarites who "siezed the Sabaean homelands and made the population subject to a new Saba-Himyar regime."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_YeHmyr1] They used the royal title 'king of Saba and dhu-Raydan' with Raydan later becoming known as Qataban.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_YeHmyr1] Dhu-Raydan (Zafar), the Himyarite capital, was located in the highlands near modern Yarim.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Roman discovery of the Indian Ocean trade winds around 100 CE signaled the end of many great civilizations in South Arabia that used overland trade routes;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_YeHmyr1] but the Himyarite state was initially an exception, and prospered. For a time the Himyarites were a subject tribe of the Romans[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_YeHmyr1] and they possessed colonies which seeded the Abyssinian Kingdom in Ethiopia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_YeHmyr1] The wealth of the Himyar state, similarly acquired as other local kingdoms from the trade of incense and spices, came from trading overseas routes. While during the second millennium CE Saba split from Himyar the Himyarites later benefited immensely at the expense of their rival kingdoms as the overland routes became increasingly less efficient and disrupted by warfare, especially in the third century CE, which involved Himyar, Saba, Hadramawt and Aksum.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Himyarites had a much more centralized polity than Saba throughout the early first millennium[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_YeHmyr1] but could not hold back the Abyssinians who invaded and occupied the tihama (Red Sea littoral) from the 2nd century CE; the Ethiopians conquered the Himyarite capital in 240 CE, but agreeing an alliance with Himyar withdraw from the Arabian peninsular[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_YeHmyr1] in about 270 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_YeHmyr1] The Himyar-Abyssinain alliance or vassalage ended about 298 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_YeHmyr1] Himyar "reached the peak of its power in the third century as a result of a successful series of wars against the local heathen tribes and the African realm of Ethiopia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_YeHmyr1] Between 270-280 CE the Sabaean Kingdom was annexed by the Himyarites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_YeHmyr1] Hadramawt was conquered by 300 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_YeHmyr1] Throughout this period the profits from the incense trade were in a progressive decline as the rise of Christianity in the west had reduced demand for a product that was most commonly used in pagan rituals. When in 395 CE the Roman emperor Theodosius declared Christianity to be the official state religion of the Roman Empire the trade ceased entirely.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At this same time Himyarites also were undergoing their own seismic shift in religious belief system - rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines by the late 4th century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_YeHmyr1] "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_YeHmyr1] "From the 4th century on the Himyarite kings were either full members or sympathizers of Judaism" and the Jewish faith became "the dominant religion" in South Arabia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_YeHmyr1] In the later fourth century there was a Jewish dynasty of kings known as the Tabbai'a.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_YeHmyr1] A list of Himyarite's known Jewish kings include: Yassirum Yohre'am (from 270 CE); 'Amr-Shlomo ben David (325-330 CE); Malki Kariba Juha'min (378-385 CE); Abu Kariba As'as (385-420 or 445 CE); Shurihbi'il Yakkuf (468-480 CE); Martad Ilan ('Judaized' 495-515 CE); Yusuf Ash'ar Dhu Nuwas (515-525 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_YeHmyr1] The Himyarite army adopted Judaism as its official religion at the start of the fifth century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Christianity also was present in Himyar at least from the first half of the 4th century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_YeHmyr1] when the Christian missionary Theophilus arrived and "complained that he found a great number of Jews".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_YeHmyr1] By 350 CE Christian communities were becoming established and over the next 100 years, "missionaries systematically converted many Arabian tribes from their traditional polytheistic practices to monotheistic Christianity".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_YeHmyr1] It is also suggested that the rulers were not Jewish but Monophysite Christians. According to Friedman (2006) Himyarite colonists, the Axumites, in the land of Cush (Ethiopia) "which they renamed Axum ... converted to Monophysite Christianity at the beginning of the fourth century. Between 340 to 378, the Axumites returned to Yemen and imposed their rule and religion over the Himyarites. Although the interregnum was short-lived, the impact of the Axumites was very profound. Yemen was a Christian land, with churches and a cathedral in San'a, and all but one of the restored Himyarite monarchs (378-525) were Monophysite Christians. The lone heretic was Dhu-Nuwas who, for unknown reasons, hated Christians and converted to Judaism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_YeHmyr1] However, Christians appear to have been repressed due to a perceived association with influence of the Byzantine Empire: "in the 470s ... a priest named Azqir was executed for active proselytisation in Najran".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_YeHmyr1] Hitti also mentions the 340-378 CE period of Abyssinian rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]An inscription dated to 378 CE claimed "the completion of buildings by a Himyar monarch had been accomplished 'through the power of their lord of sky and heaven,' and phrases such as 'the owner of the sky and earth,' and the expression 'the Merciful' also were used.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_YeHmyr1] It has been suggested that the Himyarite "profession of monotheism, and later full-fledged Judaism, distanced the Himyarites from the Christianity of the Byzantines and their Ethiopian allies and the Zoroastrianism of the Persians"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_YeHmyr1] so that their strategically located state had an independent or neutral identity. Written sources mention the presence of synagogues in Zafar and Najran.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]As trade revenues flatlined, the increasing persecution and then massacre of Christians by king Dhu Nuwas[MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_YeHmyr1] lead to a foreign intervention. The Byzantine Empire in alliance with the Aksumite Kingdom invaded the Himyarite kingdom and Dhu Nuwas was removed. Himyar and the Red Sea Coast was thereafter ruled directly by the Christian Ethiopians until the Persian conquest in 570 CE, interrupted by the Christian Ethiopian governor-general Abraha's declaration of independence between 550-553 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_YeHmyr1]</div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Complexity_variables">Social Complexity variables</span></h2><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [250,000-350,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At their heights, the Sabean and Himyarite kingdoms embraced much of historic Yemen."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the fourth century Himyar covered the lands of former Saba, Hadramawt, the mountains and the Tihamah (Red Sea coast) and Yamanat (probably the entire southern coast).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_YeHmyr1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [300,000-500,000] ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]A population estimate for the kingdom of Saba at its height could be used for the Himyarite kingdom which must have covered the same area, if not more.

"'Athtar almost always occupies first place in lists and his cult was spread throughout the region."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_YeHmyr1] Different polities/people had their own god. "The patron deity (shym) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of 'Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), 'Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the 'chrildren of their respective patron deity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_YeHmyr1] The pagan religion of South Arabia "was in its essence a planetary astral system in which the cult of the moon-god prevailed. The moon, known in Hadramawt as Sin, to the Minaeans as Wadd (love or lover, father), to the Sabaeans as Almaqah (the health-giving god?) and to the Qatabanians as 'Amm (paternal uncle), stood at the head of the pantheon. He was conceived of as a masculine deity and took precedence over the sun, Shams, who was his consort. 'Athtar (Venus, corresponding to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, Phoenician 'Ashtart), their son, was the third member of the triad. From this celestial pair sprang the many other heavenly bodies considered divine."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pagan Himyarites likely worshipped Almaqah from the time the kingdom was combined with Saba. Hitti writes that the "Himyarites were close kinsmen of the Sabaeans and, as the youngest branch of the sock, became the inheritors of the Minaeo-Sabaean culture and trade."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_YeHmyr1] The Himyarites worshipped Almaqah, 'Athtar and other deities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_YeHmyr1] Philostorgius said of the Himyarites: 'They sacrifice to the sun and moon and spirits of the land.'"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pagan Himyarites practiced dedications to temples[MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_YeHmyr1] which were likely sufficiently complex to archive papyrus legal statements concerning the usage of tombs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_YeHmyr1] Minaean carvings in the temple ruins of al-Hazm, from the first millennium BCE, suggest dancing girls may have been included among the temple servants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_YeHmyr1] Sabaean temples are known to have received tithes at the federal and local levels and its financing may been the "divine assistance" behind construction projects. "Some Middle 'Sabaean' temples may have acted as 'insurance companies' ... Hence the presence of some kind of insurance company which would provide assistance (to build, say, a house after it had been destroyed) was really very practical and useful for most clans. By paying their tithe ('s2r) to the local temples, the tribesmen paid a sort of 'premium' to this insurance company', whereby they could expect to get their 'compensation' when they needed it."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_88_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The religion of the Himyarites was pagan and polytheistic in the period 270-375 CE and Jewish or Judaistic monotheism in the period 375-525 CE when they "fell under the influence of Jewish proselytizers"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_YeHmyr1] and by the late 4th century CE were rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_YeHmyr1] "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_91_YeHmyr1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Pagan_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.
