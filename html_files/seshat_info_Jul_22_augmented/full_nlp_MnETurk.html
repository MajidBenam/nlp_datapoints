Other religions were also influential, particularly Christianity and Manichaeism, which were popular among the Sogdians, close allies of the Türk who were skilled in international trade. Although the Sogdians were a settled, urban people, they were like the Türk in that they also had a Central Eurasian warrior ethos with a pervasive comitatus tradi- tion, and both peoples were intensely interested in trade." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MnETurk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Türk religious life, not extensively documented, was based on an ancient complex of beliefs widespread in Inner Asia.84 The term “shamanism,” although conventional, is a misleading name for this belief system. Shamans, male and female, served as religious specialists, who could communicate with the spirit world. They were called on, however, only for exceptional reli- gious or medical needs, not for routine religious practice. Their ability, real or reputed, to divine the future or conjure up storms on the battlefield made their services especially significant for rulers. However, the heroic, ecstatic quest that transformed an individual from sickness and alienation through initiation into a shaman capable of performing such wonders little resembled his or her neighbors’ usual religious observance."

The Chiu T'ang-shu graphically notes this s.a. 698 when the newly reviving Turk state staged a dramatic raid that netted some 80,000-90,000 Chinese captives. Paradoxically, the ability of the nomads to provide for the slave market helped to increase the demand for slave labor in neighboring sedentary societies. This, in turn, could further stimulate slave-raiding by the nomads to met this need."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_104_MnETurk] "Practices, as well as terms, could be borrowed. The Sogdian merchants often bought slaves (chakar) and formed guards or even private armies to guard their homes while they were traveling; this may have been the model for slave military recruitment in later Islamic and especially Turkic societies.

With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni; Agathe Dupeyron ♥</b> AD responsible for opportunistic data-gathering, EC for coding.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>"There are many references to caverns in which Turks had lived prior to their obtaining political power, and terms such as "ancestral" or "birth" caverns occur frequently. According to the Chou shu, the kaghan of the Turks "every year leads the nobles to the ancestral cavern to offer a sacrifice." The statement is repeated in several texts derived from the Chou shu and refers to the ruler of the Eastern Turks on whose territory the cavern - clearly a national shrine - was located. This, and also the practice of the annual ceremony, is confirmed by the Sui shu, which reports that every year the Western Turks send a high dignitary (or several dignitaries) to offer a sacrifice in the ancestral cavern. In the light of other evidence pointing to the mining or metallurgical activities of the Turks, there is reason to believe that these caverns were in fact mines. Semi-historical accounts of later date - which cannot here be examined in detail - firmly link "ancestral caverns" with metallurgy." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_106_MnETurk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Valentine was received by Turxath, son of the recently deceased Silziboulos, at whose funeral he was called upon to assist. The ceremony involved human sacrifice and, for the Romans, the painful obligation to lacerate their faces." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_107_MnETurk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"As described in the sources, the process of electing the ruler reflects an archaic ceremonial probably ignored in real life. Accordingto the Chou shu, when the Turks elect a ruler, the high dignitaries of the realm bundle him in a felt rug and spin him nine times from east to west. After each turn, they bow to him. Then the ruler-elect is put on horseback and has to ride - probably to ascertain whether he can still mount a steed in a dizzy state. After the ride he is strangled with a silken shawl until he almost chokes. When the shawl is loosened, those standing around fire at him the question " H o w long will you be our kaghan?" The kaghan, dazed, is unable to give a clear answer, but from his mutterings those assisting at the ritual take a clue as to the length of hisreign. The Arab geographer Al-Istakhri ascribes almost the same ritual to the Khazars: "When they wish to appoint a kaghan, they bring him and throttle him with a piece of silk till he is nearly strangled, Then they say to him, 'How long do you wish to reign?' He says 'So and so many years.' If he dies before then, well and good. If not, he is killed when he reaches the year in question."1 3 Turks and Khazars were closely linked politically and linguistically, and the parallels between their rituals are not surprising. However, one wonders whether in the often bloody struggles for the throne such procedures were indeed followed." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_108_MnETurk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Possible dysphoric ritual (for the participant):"At his investiture ceremony, the kaghan was first wrapped in a felt rug and spun nine times, then mounted on a horse and made to ride, and then nearly strangled with a silk shawl. When he had almost lost consciousness, he would be asked to state how many years he would rule." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_109_MnETurk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Most frequent ritual: ancestor cult[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"That centered instead on the maintenance of life and health within the community and in relation to the ancestors and the cosmic forces. The most fundamental rites were offerings to the ancestors of the family and commu- nity.85 The ancestral rites focused on the hearth (ocak), one of the most per- sistent and widely evoked symbols in Turkic cultures. At the hearth, offerings of food and drink were either cast into the fire or smeared on the mouth of wood or felt “idols” that represented the ancestors and were kept near the hearth. Ancestor figures, carved in stone and holding what appear to be li- bation vessels in their hands, were also common features of Turkic burial sites. Not only did the hearth fire symbolize familial continuity, but the hearth also possessed great spatial and cosmological significance. Dug out by the mother, it implied a gate opened to the ancestor’s nether world. Centrally located in the round felt tent, it symbolized the center of the world. Through the smoke hole above, the hearth was on an axis with the cosmos. The sa- cred images of the Mountain, Tree, Cave, Water, and Female Spirit all became identified with the hearth through its cosmic orientation and through its opening into the nether world of the “grandmothers,” the ancestral fe- male spirits. The rites performed around the hearth helped to ensure kut, the life force that brought children to life, that fell through the smoke hole to bring good fortune to a family, or that conveyed the divine mandate to a ruler. Within such a spiritual frame of reference, as the Türk origin myths illustrate, the significant origin is not that of the universe or of humankind in general but of a specific family or kin group. The significant First Man is the progenitor, not of all humanity, but of one’s own people. Such a narra- tive can serve, then, as a “confederative charter” on which to unite a people or build an empire. Later narratives of religious conversion combine in the figure of the First Man both the faith-bringer and the forefather of a new kinship or ethnic group" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_110_MnETurk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Candidate for largest scale ritual: ancestor rite of a ruling dynasty[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The religious rites of a ruling dynasty would have been more elaborate but not different in kind. The identification of sovereignty with control of sacred sites—an enduring theme in Turkic political culture—elaborated on the symbolism of the hearth. For the Türk Empire, this meant particularly the Ötüken mountain, which had also been sacred for the Xiongnu and the Rouran.86 Chinese sources mention Ötüken as the kaghan’s constant place of residence, in contrast to his subjects’ migratory habits, adding that each year the kaghan would “lead the nobles to the ancestral cave to offer sacri- fices.” If there was a difference in spiritual emphases between dynast and ordinary nomad, it took the form of the greater devotion to Tengri, the supreme deity, in the politicized state cult, with the kaghan as high priest.87 Tengri had two messenger gods (Yol tengri), of which one brought kut to the individual while the other restored the state, in which emperor and empress (kagan and khatun) ruled as earthly counterparts of Tengri and Umay, divinities of sky and earth. Rulers may also have had greater need than or- dinary folk for the services of shamans, especially to divine the future (or at least the rulers’ preferences concerning future policy). For the nonelite, other spirits, especially ancestral ones, may have been more meaningful.88" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_111_MnETurk]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MnETurk&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ annual gathering ♥</b> "Like the Hsiung-nu, the Türk khagans held annual gatherings of regional chiefs, which helped bind together the various groups that made up the empire.

However, in the fifth century BCE, Herodotus says they were performed by the Scythians [MAJIDBENAM_REF_179_MnETurk] (typically the first people mentioned in histories of Central Eurasia, even though they never reached as far as our NGA), we know that the Khitan performed them in the tenth century at least [MAJIDBENAM_REF_180_MnETurk], and we know that the Mongols performed them in subsequent centuries [MAJIDBENAM_REF_181_MnETurk]. This suggests continuity between the Scythians, Khitan and Mongols, which in turn suggests that the blood brotherhood ritual was probably performed by peoples that inhabited Central Eurasia after the Scythians and before the Khitan - and these people may well have included the Xiungnu. "Herodotus also tells us that the Scythians give each other sworn pledges by pouring their blood, mixed with wine, into a bowl in which they dip a sword, arrows, an axe and a javelin before drinking from it. We may note that the use of arrows in making a 'blood-brother' agreement is evidenced in the case of Genghis Khan and also in East (or Chinese) Turkistan (now Sinkiang or Xinjiang in north-west China): there, as generally among the Turks and Mongols, the weapons represent the souls of men themselves." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_182_MnETurk] "Arrows (along with bows, saddles, horses, and gowns) also figure in ritual exchanges made between two men who agree to be blood-brothers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_183_MnETurk]. "Found in many Turco-Mongol nomadic societies, the ritual of blood brotherhood involved drinking from a cup into which blood from both parties had been poured. The 'brothers' would then exchange gifts and usually spend some time living in the same YURT, or <i>ger</i>. Blood brotherhood formed an important way of cementing political alliances."

A Chinese record states that in 647 the Uighur kaghan "set up the names of officials similar to those which had formerly existed among the Turks,"  and an examination of the Uighurs of the empire period shows no radical departure from this pattern. Moreover, there is no evidence that the functions of the various officials had changed much since earlier times. There were also a few official titles of Chinese origin. Most of these had been used already by the Turks, and not taken over by the Uighurs directly from China. The most striking was the tutuk derived from the Chinese tu-tu. This title had been in use among the steppe people for centuries. According to one authority, it had perhaps "not been borrowed by the Turkic founders of the new [Turk] empire, but by their predecessors, the Juan-juans."It is therefore not surprising that the word carried different meanings among the Uighurs and 8th-century Chinese. In the T'ang empire, a tu-tu was the leading official of a tu-tu fu, a title applied to certain major cities and their environs. Among the Uighurs, the tutuk were tribal leaders and there were eleven of them, one for each of the nine major tribes of the confederation and the Karluk and Basmil. A contemporary Chinese scholar writes that, apart from their political leadership they "were responsible for collecting taxes for the state treasury."  The tutuk of the Uighurs, that is the leading tribe of the nine, was normally a close relation of the kaghan, but not the kaghan himself. Presumably, the chieftains lived among their own people away from the capital, but they certainly held influence at court and maintained their own garrison there. Information is lacking on whether the position of tutuk was hereditary. There is, however, ample evidence that the Yaghlakar kaghans normally succeeded from father to son, a pattern by no means universal among other Turkic rulers."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_216_MnETurk]</div><div

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_MnETurk] “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (śīla): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_247_MnETurk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> “Living a morally good life thus always brings a twofold benefit: Others are aided and one’s own spiritual development or karmic disposition is positively affected.

Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_268_MnETurk] <i>The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_281_MnETurk] </i>‘Right action’ basically means to act gently and kindly and to be ‘compassionate to all living beings’. What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’."

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21)."
