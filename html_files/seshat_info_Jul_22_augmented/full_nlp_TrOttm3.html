The Sufi orders (see Sufism), which put Ali and the prophet’s descendants at the center of their devotions, were much more popular in the early Ottoman Empire. But in 1501 Shah Ismail I (r. 1501-24) made Imami Shiism the religion of his court in Iran and began to persecute Sunni Muslims in his realm. In addition, the Turkoman tribes of eastern Anatolia rose in rebellion against the Ottomans, proclaiming Shah Ismail to be the long-awaited imam who would restore justice to the world. These rebels were known as the Kizilbaş in Ottoman texts and were ruled as heretics by the Ottoman Sunni legal establishment, making it legally permissible for the Ottoman army to kill them. The Shii rebellion against the Ottomans was temporarily ended by the Battle of Çaldiran in 1512. But the continued presence of a hostile Shii Iran played a significant role in bolstering the Ottoman attachment to Sunni Islam. With the hostile “heretic” Shia on their eastern borders and the ongoing anti-Muslim challenges from the Christian world, the Ottoman sultans were increasingly motivated to present themselves as the upholders and defenders of what they regarded as the true faith of Sunni Islam. [...] The embrace of Sunni orthodoxy by the Ottoman political and legal elite did not translate, however, into the persecution of those Shiis in the empire who accepted Ottoman rule peacefully, even if they held the view that such rule was illicit in the absence of the imam. This tolerance was especially manifested in the Ottoman treatment of the Shia of Iraq. When Süleyman I (r. 1520-66) conquered Baghdad in 1535, for instance, he endowed Shii shrines as well as Sunni ones and hosted Shii clergy along with their Sunni counterparts. Subsequent Ottoman governors extended this strategy of tolerance and even provided patronage to Shii shrines and clergy. In part, this was due to a realization that it was best not to alienate the Shii subjects of the sultan in Iraq. But it also seems to have arisen out of a more general cultural practice of tolerance that the sultans extended to both nonSunnis and non-Muslims."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_TrOttm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ Hanafi ♥</b> "The Ottoman dynasty established the Hanafi tradition as the official legal interpretation of the empire, but it did not compel scholars to abandon their own legal traditions to conform to that favored in Istanbul. Nevertheless, if a scholar wished to ingratiate himself with the new regime a switch might seem prudent."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrOttm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ Sufi ♥</b> "Despite sultanic support of some Sufi orders, Sufis also sometimes challenged the sultans’ authority by claiming they had access to a truth that could never be known by those who had not embarked on the path of mysticism. In the aftermath of the defeat of Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389-1402) at Ankara in 1402, the Sufi Sheikh Bedrettin preached in favor of a social movement that sought to tear down the differences between classes and religions. His movement gained great popularity among the ordinary people of all religions and his disciple, Börlüce Mustafa, started a revolt against the Ottoman in 1416. The rebels had some initial success but the Ottoman army was finally able to defeat them and Bedrettin and thousands of his followers were executed. The Ottomans also faced other revolts led by radical Sufis in the 15th and 16th centuries. Indeed, one of the greatest challenges to the Ottoman throne came from Shah Ismail, who headed an extremist Sufi order that believed him to be the long-awaited hidden imam."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrOttm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b> "Once they had established their empire, the Ottoman sultans had close relations to two Sufi groups, the Mevlevi Order and the Bektaşi Order, although these two could not be more different in their religious outlook. The Mevlevi Order, founded by the son of the 13th century poet Rumi, was the order of Ottoman intellectuals and attracted poets, musicians, and calligraphers. The order established convents or hostels (tekke) in various Ottoman cities and these served as centers for the teaching of art and music as well as being places of spiritual retreat. The Bektaşi Order, by contrast, was the order of the Janissaries and its traditions were oral rather than literary. Although many of its practices were unorthodox, such as the drinking of wine, it too received official recognition from the sultans as a way of keeping the troops happy. The sultans and their families supported both orders financially by establishing some of their convents and bestowing lavish gifts on the orders’ sheikhs. [...] In the second half of the 18th century, a more austere and rigorous Sufi order, the Naqshbandiyya Order, answered some of the objections raised by the Muslim fundamentalists to Sufism. The Naqshbandis believe in a strict adherence to sharia and reject the notion of sainthood found in many other Sufi orders, but they still hold that the understanding of God that can only be gained from a mystical experience is a vital, necessary part of Islam. The sober interpretation of mysticism offered by the Naqshbandiyya Order was popular among intellectuals within the Ottoman Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries as it offered a compromise between mysticism and the interpretations of Islam that fundamentalists such as the Wahhabis were preaching. However, critics of Sufism still did not accept the Naqshbandiyya as being rooted in a proper understanding of Islam."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrOttm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus#2 ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family#2 ♣ Shia ♥</b> "Although Sunni Islam, as interpreted by the Hanafi School of law, was the state religion of the Ottoman Empire, there were sizeable Shii minorities in several of the Ottoman Arab provinces, most notably in what are today the countries of Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. In the first two, the Shia followed the Imami tradition. The dominant form of Islam in Iran today, the Imami tradition is known to some Western scholars as “Twelver Shiism” as its believers hold that the 12th imam, who vanished in the ninth century c.e., will return at some future time to institute a reign of absolute justice on earth. In Lebanon, the adherents of this community were known as the Mitwallis in the Ottoman period, although it is not a name they use today to refer to themselves. Both the Imami tradition and the Zaydi tradition followed by the Shia of Yemen trace the descent of their imams from the line of the sixth imam, Jaafar al-Sadiq (702-65), but the Imami trace their tradition through Sadiq’s son Musa al-Kazim while the Zaydi trace their tradition through his son Muhammad.

With its capital in Istanbul, the main organ of state power was the 'elaborate court, palace, and household government'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrOttm3] Policy-making was weakly institutionalized: in theory, all decisions were made by the sultan himself, and so Ottoman policies were shaped by the sultan's personal character and by the 'individuals or factions who had his ear'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrOttm3] The sultans appointed their own staff and paid them with a wage or (increasingly after 1600 CE) a fief.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrOttm3] State funding came in large part from money raised by fief holders until Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha Kulliyesi (in office from 1718 CE) introduced a property tax.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrOttm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The administrative and military officials around the sultan were slaves educated in palace schools.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrOttm3] The source of this non-Turkish administrative class was the <i>devsirme</i> tribute, which began in 1438 CE; by the 16th century about 1,000 boys were taken per year per recruiting province in the Balkans and non-Muslim communities in Anatolia. The system divided these slaves into those who would serve the bureaucracy and those who would form the elite military corps known as janissaries. In 1582 CE, recruits of non-devsirme origin, including free Muslims, were permitted to join the janissaries and after 1648 CE the devsirme system was no longer used to recruit for the janissaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrOttm3] The imperial household together with its armies and administrative officials was truly vast, numbering about 100,000 people by the 17th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrOttm3] The renowned Ottoman architect Sinan was a tribute slave; he notably designed the Sehzade and Süleyman <i>külliyes</i> (complexes of buildings including mosques and mausoleums) and the Selim Mosque at Edirne (1569-1575 CE), with its four 83-metre-high minarets.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrOttm3][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrOttm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ottoman sultans issued decrees through an imperial council (<i>divan</i>)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrOttm3] and the chief executive power below the sultan, the grand vizier.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrOttm3] Although certain regions (Egypt, for example) may have differed slightly in their governing structure, Ottoman regional government typically involved governors (<i>beylerbeyi</i>)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrOttm3] whose provinces were split into districts (<i>sanjaks</i>) under district governors (<i>sanjak beyi</i>).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrOttm3] The sanjak beyi also was a military commander.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrOttm3] Fief-holding soldiers were responsible for local law and order within their districts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrOttm3] By the late 16th century, the lowest level of this system had transformed into a system of tax farms or fiefs given to non-military administrators.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrOttm3] In 1695 CE, these tax farms were 'sold as life tenures (<i>malikane</i>)', and later shares in tax farms were sold to the public.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrOttm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ottoman law was divided into religious - Islamic sharia - and secular <i>kanun</i> law.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrOttm3] Kanun law essentially served to fill the gaps left by the religious legal tradition, regulating 'areas where the provisions of the sacred law were either missing or too much at at odds with reality to be applicable'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TrOttm3] In the Ottoman Empire, this included aspects of criminal law, land tenure and taxation; kanun law drew its legitimacy from precedent and custom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_TrOttm3] Military judges (<i>kadi'asker</i>) were the heads of the empire's judiciary and heard cases brought before the imperial council.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_TrOttm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ottoman Anatolia further enhanced many aspects of Byzantine culture. In 1331, in an attempt to spread Islam to new territories, Iranian and Egyptian scholars were brought to Iznik in northwestern Anatolia to teach at the first Ottoman college.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TrOttm3] Palace schools were created to train the next generation of Ottoman officials. During the 15th and 16th centuries CE, about 500 libraries were built by sultans and high Ottoman dignitaries. These were maintained by <i>waqf</i> religious foundations; the majority in Istanbul, Bursa and Erdine. Initially, these were <i>madrassa</i> libraries and specialist libraries, but the first independent Ottoman <i>waqf</i> libraries were founded by the Koprulu family in 1678 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TrOttm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Ottoman postal system (<i>ulak</i>) structured around postal stations (similar to the Mongol <i>yam</i>)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_TrOttm3] spanned an empire of 5.2 million square kilometres at its greatest extent,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_TrOttm3] with a population of approximately 28 million people in 1600 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_TrOttm3] Istanbul likely had a population of at least 650,000 in 1600 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_TrOttm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Ottoman Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Ottoman_Empire_1500CE: 1517CE-1599CE ♥</b>  Ottoman_Empire_1500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_TrOttm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  1108737: 1517CE-1599CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Turkic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Oghuz ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Turkish ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Suffism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Mevlevi ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Suffism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Sect ♣ Bektasi ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family2 ♣ Shia Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Sect2 ♣ Twelver ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>This polity was coded early, was the target of dedicated workshops, and had many experts look over it.

The pirates of Rhodes were capturing large numbers of ships bringing grain and gold from the new Arab provinces and carrying pilgrims to and from the Holy Cities, thus threatening the sultan's prestige as well as his pockets. Strategic as well as political reasons impelled Suleyman to neutralize Rhodes before moving into central Europe. A major expeditionary force mounted a prolonged siege during the summer of 1522. Pitted against the Ottomans were some 60,000 defenders manning one of the strongest forts known to the world at the time. Assault after assault was thrown back until Ottoman agents among the Jews and Muslim women enslaved by the Knights enabled the sultan's forces to break in and force a surrender (December 20, 1522). By its terms all inhabitants wishing to leave the island were allowed to go, and the Knights could take their weapons and other belongings. Those who remained were exempted from taxes for five years and given the same conditions of freedom of religion found elsewhere in the sultan's dominions. Thus in fact few inhabitants left. The Knights, however, were transported on papal ships to Malta, which they fortified and built into a new base of anti-Muslim operation in the heart of the central Mediterranean. With Rhodes in Ottoman hands, however, the eastern Mediterranean was now safe.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<a href="/w/index.php?title=Second_Mamluk_Revolt_(1527_CE)" title="Second Mamluk Revolt (1527 CE)">Second Mamluk Revolt (1527 CE)</a>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<a href="/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Belgrade_(1520_CE)" title="Siege of Belgrade (1520 CE)">Siege of Belgrade (1520 CE)</a>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<a href="/w/index.php?title=Second_Ottoman-Hungarian_(1526_CE)" title="Second Ottoman-Hungarian (1526 CE)">Second Ottoman-Hungarian (1526 CE)</a>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<a href="/w/index.php?title=Second_Celali_Revolt_(1526_CE-1527_CE)" title="Second Celali Revolt (1526 CE-1527 CE)">Second Celali Revolt (1526 CE-1527 CE)</a>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<a href="/w/index.php?title=Siege_of_Vienna_(1529_CE)" title="Siege of Vienna (1529 CE)">Siege of Vienna (1529 CE)</a> With the Habsburgs preoccupied, Süleyman was able to reoccupy Buda (September 3, 1529) and the remainder of the country with little difficulty. He then mounted the first Ottoman siege of Vienna (September 27-October 15, 1529) in the hope of either capturing the Habsburg capital or at least so disrupting the Austrian military system that Ferdinand would be unable to threaten Hungary for some time to come. However, the season was too late. The attackers were unable to secure sufficient supplies and ammunition due to the early arrival of winter. Meanwhile, Charles was able to make peace with Francis at Cambrai (August 3, 1529) and to send reinforcements. While the suburbs of Vienna were largely destroyed, the walls pierced in many places and the defenders suffering severely, Vienna held out even after Ferdinand and most of his court had fled. The Janissary corps - already unhappy because the sultan had not allowed it to ravage Buda - again became restless. Turkish raiders began going through the Alps into southern Germany, reaching Ratisbon in Bavaria and Brunn (Brno) in Bohemia. Europe was in a panic. If the sultan had held out only a little longer, his forces might well have broken into Vienna, where they could have remained for the winter before pushing onward. But the combination of difficulties finally convinced Süleyman to return to Istanbul for the winter. Therefore, the siege was broken off and Vienna saved for Christianity.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<a href="/w/index.php?title=Ottoman-Ethiopian_(1529_CE-1544_CE)" title="Ottoman-Ethiopian (1529 CE-1544

On these cyclically repeating occasions, attendance was necessarily sporadic and partial when compared to the attendance of the sultan’s officials at the multi-week surs, where participation was not just strongly encouraged but virtually obligatory and universal." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_325_TrOttm3] Surs were grand festivals that celebrated the circumcision of the sultan's son(s). "During the entire course of the minimum two-week celebrations - occasionally stretched to six weeks or longer, to approach the legendary figure of 40 days and 40 nights of public rejoicing on exceptional occasions - there was a general relaxing of the usual restrictions on public behaviour and a toleration for drinking, carousing and other forms of social intercourse that were frowned upon or actively prohibited during ‘normal’ times. The interaction between, and the mutual enjoyment shared by, members of the major-faith communities of the Muslims, Christians and Jews were maximized during these secular festivals, called shenlik  (‘rejoicings’), in a way that was never possible on the other occasions for communal celebration, which by definition were bound to the specific religious calendars of each particular faith. In general terms, we know that the Muslim ulema took a rather disapproving stance regarding such celebrations, but others viewed them as a necessary and salutary form of release from the everyday strain of unrelenting devotion to work and duty. The elaborate celebrations for the circumcision feast of the sultan’s male offspring provided such respite only once, or at most twice, during a reign, but the communal celebrations and city illuminations (<i>donanma</i>) commonly ordered on the occasion of notable military victories could and did recur more frequently. Such universal celebrations served to break down the barriers not just between communities of the faithful but also between the refined and the unrefined social classes (the <i>havas</i> and the <i>avam</i>) who, especially during the less formally structured evening entertainments, mingled more or less indiscriminately on the streets of Istanbul and took part in what the disapproving would have described as orgiastic or bacchanalian delights offered to onlookers and spectators from all walks of life. Whether one approved or disapproved, there can be no doubt that, during their brief duration, the festivals served as platforms and stages for both social leveling and social inclusion." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_326_TrOttm3] Entertainment and food were provided for the masses, while higher officials enjoyed more orderly banquets. An important component of the ritual were lengthy processions of dignitaries and officials, as well as representatives of the artesanal classes, who demonstrated their loyalty to the sultan through the presentation of gifts and demonstrations of submission. This event was the prime vehicle through which the sultan demonstrated his power, influence, and generosity, strengthening the bond between himself and his people; and, at the same time, it was a way for him to smooth his children's eventual inheritance of the throne, as their coming of age would forever be associated, in the minds of people, with lavish celebrations and general rejoicing [MAJIDBENAM_REF_327_TrOttm3].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ once per generation ♥</b> "The elaborate celebrations for the circumcision feast of the sultan’s male offspring provided such respite only once, or at most twice, during a reign[...]."

Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together.

Descriptions of the festival are surprisingly rare, especially as regards how it was celebrated in the past, but given that most Islamic practices demonstrate a great degree of continuity with the past, so descriptions of how the festival is celebrated in modern times may apply to how it was celebrated in the past as well. 'Id al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of the month-long Islamic fast known as Ramadan. "As in the Friday afternoon congregational prayer of the weekly Day of Assembly, the Eid morning prayers at the mosque should be preceded by a bath and attended with clean (often new) clothes. After breakfast, men, women, and children gather at an outdoor prayer meeting, the <i>musallah</i>, in front of a white wall adorned with a niche, the <i>mihraab</i> pointing in the direction of Mecca (like the one in every mosque). Women are given the option of praying at home--as they mostly do the rest of the year. The prayers consist of two units (<i>rakat</i>) plus the six-to-sixteen additional <i>takbir</i> recitations of <i>Allahu Akbar</i> ('God is Most Great'). These set them apart from Friday prayers, as does the fact that they are followed instead of preceded by a two-part sermon (<i>khutba</i>). [...] This enthusiasm erupts spontaneously on the aptly named <i>Eid-al-Fitr</i>, the festival of the breaking of the month-long Ramadan fast. Still, by then, passions have been so well trained that few unbridled excesses are in evidence at the happy family celebrations of warm community that follow or at the fairground attractions that are set up in some places [...]. Indeed, restored social harmony is on display everywhere over up to three days, with people greeting and congratulating each other in the streets as well as on afternoon visits to relatives, friends, and sick people. Many gifts are offered, particularly to the children of less fortunate families. At home, the family celebrates around a noontime festive meal [...]. Dead relatives are also remembered as their graves are visited that day."

the ninth, [pilgrims] proceed towards ‘Arafat, a plain 14.5km (nine miles) from Mina, where the central rite of the Hajj, wuquf (standing) on ‘Arafat, takes place between noon and sunset, during which time many heartfelt prayers are offered. The scene reminds Muslims of the gathering on the Day of Judgement. If any pilgrim misses this event, his/her Hajj is not valid and has to be done again another year. This does not apply to any other rite, all of which can be done over a longer period or compensated for with an offering. This is the time for the pilgrims to read the Qur’an, glorify God and pray most earnestly for forgiveness and everything else they wish for. Particularly recommended for glorification and repetition is this prayer, ‘There is no God but Allah alone, with no partner. Dominion and praise belong to Him, who gives life and death. Goodness is in His hands and He has power over everything.’ This just gives a succinct summary of the Islamic faith and connects the individual pilgrim to what Ibrahim and Muhammad brought and uttered. Pilgrims normally face towards the Ka‘ba while reciting these prayers, as they do for the five daily prayers, believing that, by doing this, their prayers are more likely to be accepted.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_480_TrOttm3]. This ritual is coded here as dysphoric due to the fact that pilgrims are required to stand for several hours (between noon and sunset) under the sun’s heat. A contemporary account, dating to 1997, notes that the “heat is virtually unbearable” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_481_TrOttm3]. However, it is worth noting that, due to peculiarities of the Islamic calendar, this ritual may sometimes be performed at a time of the year when the temperature is less hot than at other times, and when there are fewer others between noon and sunset than at other times. Moreover, a few informal online sources suggest that those who cannot stand in the sun for the duration of the ritual are allowed to be in the shade and/or sit down. Still, though relatively mild, this appears to be the most dysphoric ritual within Sunni Islam.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar [MAJIDBENAM_REF_482_TrOttm3].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_483_TrOttm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 6 ♥</b> hours, on average.

However, the fact that no source could be found that even ‘’mentions’’ human sacrifice in connection with Islam (beyond the occasional lurid, and dubious, tabloid headline), combined with the fact that a lot of information is available on the beliefs and practices underlining this religion, strongly suggests that human sacrifice is not part of the Islamic ritual repertoire. ““Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2;. In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice. This could be termed an advance in civilization. The Islamic interpretation comes close to this interpretation, as it makes this a founding myth for el eid.”</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_513_TrOttm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of an in-group member ♣ absent ♥</b> [Text from sacrifice codings by Agathe] No source could be found that explicitly states Islam’s condemnation of human sacrifice.

When the army returned to Istanbul, the Janissaries did not allow Selim to enter the palace until he paid the culus gratuity, a gift of money customarily paid by sultans to the military upon accession to the throne."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_TrOttm3] <b>*1574*</b> Murad III's accession was a 'race to Istanbul' contest: "On the night of his arrival in Istanbul, seasick after a long crossing from his seat of government at Magnesia, Murad had ordered his five brothers to be strangled."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_538_TrOttm3] <b>*1595*</b> Mehmed III's accession was a 'race to Istanbul' contest: "The first action of his son, who succeeded him as Mehmet III, was to have his nineteen brothers strangled by mutes - the largest fratricidal sacrifice in Ottoman history. ...

The revolt was initially against "no fewer than seventeen specified officials and favourites" rather than the sultan himself but even after they were given the Grand Vizier to kill the rebels and the deposition of the Mufti, they "continued to publicly discuss that of Murad himself."

Accordingly, the Ottoman ruler was conceived to have received “fortune” (kut) as in the Turco-Mongolian tradition, “divine light” (farr) as in the Persian tradition, and “good turn of fortune” (devlet) as in the Islamic tradition."

As part of this genealogical obsession, the Ottomans sought to further legitimize their power by crafting a noble genealogy suitable to their imperial visions. The Ottomans lacked any connection to the two most prestigious lineages in the post-Mongolian Islamic world, those of the Prophet Muhammad and Genghis Khan (r. 1206-27, the founder of the Mongol Empire). To remedy this, Ottoman literati - especially in the 15th and early 16th centuries - busied themselves crafting impressive genealogical connections for their forbears. As a result the Oghuz genealogy came to be an official exposi- tion of Ottoman lineage showing that the Ottoman rulers were the descendants of Oghuz Khan, who was also iden- tified as the biblical Japhet or in some expositions as the Quranic Alexander the two-horned. Presenting Oghuz Khan as a believer who is praised in the Quran made the Ottoman genealogy superior to that of Genghis Khan. However, this genealogy gradually lost its appeal toward the end of the 16th century and was replaced by the self- justifying lineage of the Ottoman sultans starting with the founder of the principality, Osman I (d. 1324)."

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minūn) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women.

"Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_662_TrOttm3] "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_663_TrOttm3] "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_664_TrOttm3] "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_666_TrOttm3] Moreover, justice is one of the key Islamic virtues: <i>In all their dealings, Muslims are required to stand firmly for justice even if it be against themselves or their kith and kin: 'O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)."

The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are.

[...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void.

The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_673_TrOttm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft.

Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty.
