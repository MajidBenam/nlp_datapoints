[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_GrCrArc] The Doric Cretan alphabet was very close to its Phoenician model.

However, exceptions were permitted among powerful men for dynastic reasons, especially during the Hellenistic period (Alexander is a good example, and also the Ptolemies). And throughout Greek history, even ordinary men could have a concubine (pallakis), visit prostitutes, conduct affairs with boys, etc. There was no presumption of male sexual fidelity as a part of the marital state. That was strictly for wives. It was considered in bad taste to keep a concubine in the same house as one’s wife, but that was just about the only restriction. In general, the philosophers said that sexual desire was something men must suppress in order to achieve the good life; they thought that friendship was the most important value and it should always take precedence over sex. [...] The bottom line is that monogamy was the cultural expectation (supported by religion in the sense that even Zeus and Poseidon and Hades only had one wife each). The philosophers did not make much headway in changing this, and where they did, it was more in favor of abstinence (either with or without marriage) than of polygamy.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_197_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ absent ♥</b> idea of charity / prosocial activity rose later, in some Classical poleis and then in Hellenistic Kingdoms. “Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary.

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14).

However, not only does such compensation appear in our earliest textual source, but Pausanias (10.28.4-6) tells us of the great painting of the underworld by the fifth-century BCE painter Polygnotos, which included such depictions. [...] A man who treated his father unjustly is being throttled by him, while another who plundered a temple is being tormented by a female skilled in poisons. Pausanias comments that the Greeks in Polygnotos' time thought that failing to respect parents and the gods were the worst crimes, and that is why Polygnotos has illustrated these cases. Polygnotos' painting, while exceptional in size and scope, is not exceptional in its subject matter: numerous vase paintings show scenes of underworld reward or punishment, and a Demosthenic speech mentions paintings depicting the afterlife torments of the impious as a familiar trope for his audience ([Dem.] 25.53)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_235_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of bravery♣ absent ♥</b> Though andreia (manliness/bravery) was a very important cultural value, rewards for it and punishments for its opposite came from one's peers, not the gods[MAJIDBENAM_REF_236_GrCrArc].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of purity♣ present ♥</b> "Hesiod is generally quick to remark that the gods are pleased when the rites are performed correctly, and are displeased when proper ritual purity is not obtained. [...] We can also observe different grades of divine anger: libating with unwashed hands renders the ritual null and void, and the gods refuse to communicate with the worshipper. The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity. The intensity of the contact with the divinity corresponds directly to the intensity of the purity required for the worshipper and to the severity of the divine punishment if this requirement is violated."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_237_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ general supernatural enforcement of morality ♣ present ♥</b> "Although Homer's epic depicts a few exceptional figures like Tantalos and Sisyphos receiving punishment in the underworld (<i>Od.</i> 11 576-600), elaborate descriptions of underworld retributions come mostly from later sources, causing some scholars to suppose that a compensatory afterlife is a later invention.

In myth, Tantalos and Lykaion are both punished for offering human flesh to the gods--which is not only a form of impiety, but also "broke the alimentary which helped articulate the cosmos; it thus endangered the cosmic order, threatening to drag the gods, who are its guarantors, to the level of bestiality to which Tantalos himself had drifted, to make the very guarantors of the cosmic order transgress one of the fundamental rules which help articulate the universe. Tantalos' transgression of the taboo against cannibalism also endangered human society, for it threatened the breakdown of civilization and a reversion to savagery, of which cannibalism was perceived to be an important characteristic."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_240_GrCrArc][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Human Enforcement of Morality</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor—it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_241_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_242_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ disputed_present_absent ♥</b> “It depends on what kind of authority. The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_243_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “As I have suggested at the beginning of this paper, the idea that a ritually cleaned body cannot free a person from guilt and cannot be a sufficient require- ment for a harmonious relationship between mortals and immortals can be un- derstood as an implicit criticism of rituals. We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_244_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> “Piety required respect for one’s parents, especially in regard to making the annual offerings once they were dead. To mistreat a parent or neglect a parental tomb was a sign of moral depravity. Greek city-states legislated that children owed their parents food, lodging and burial (this goes back to Solon, the first lawgiver at Athens); those who failed in this duty could have their citizenship rights revoked. The worst crimes imaginable were incest with a parent and killing one’s own parent. Killing one’s own child did not carry the same weight of horror, although any kin-murder was considered more serious than murder of non-kin. The expectations for ritual purification after killing made these types of distinctions, and they could be regarded as a form of “regulation.” The Greeks recognized both written and unwritten laws. In general, the need to obey and respect parents was much, much stronger than any parental obligation to a child. Greek fathers throughout antiquity had the right to “expose” offspring they rejected at birth, which meant abandoning the infant either in the wild or in a place known to be used for that purpose, where it might or might not be picked up by slave traders. This did not count as murder, although once the infant was acknowledged by the father and accepted into the household, that would be a different matter. The Kyrene religious law code of the 4th century BCE says that “a man is bound as far as his brother’s children,” meaning that religious obligation (such as paying a fine levied for religious offense on a nephew) extended that far, and only on the paternal side.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_245_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> “Yes, this was definitely a “promoted value.” The Greeks called it either andreia (lit. “manliness”) or arete(“excellence”). A boy’s first school text was the Iliad, and he had to memorize long passages and write them out (or suffer beatings). As you know, this text is much concerned with the display of manly prowess in combat, which was the ultimate test of andreia. Evidence of cowardice (such as wounds taken in the back, or throwing away a shield in order to run) could ruin a man’s reputation in life or death. Plutarch wrote a book “On the Arete of Women,” in which he describes women who behaved in unexpectedly brave ways (usually by showing physical courage, fighting invaders, or counseling their men against cowardice). Some citations from the Hellenistic author Polybius: 5.111: King Attalus brought Gauls over from Europe as mercenaries because of their reputation for andreia. 6.46: [Citing unnamed sources] ‘For [they say that there are] two things on which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—andreia in the face of the enemy and concord at home.’ 27.8 [Deliberations by the Macedonian general Perseus after a victory]: ‘after this taste of Macedonian andreia, the Romans will be much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or harsh burden upon the Macedonians.’” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> “I recommend the chapter “Greek law in the Hellenistic period” in M. Gagarin ed. The Cambridge Companion to Greek Law (2005). There is also a chapter on family and property law. In general, there was great respect for property and a great concern for handing down property from one generation to another through the institution of marriage. First cousin, half-sibling and uncle-niece marriages were permitted or even required for heiresses, in order to keep property within the paternal family. The Romans noticed this Greek habit of endogamy and disapproved of it. Daniel Ogden’s bookGreek Bastardy may also be of help here. Zeus Herkeios was one of the gods who protected the household and its stores from robbers; there were many gods of this kind.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_247_GrCrArc]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that, in later times, religious agents interpreted divine punishments and advised the faithful on the most appropriate method of atonement.
