The Fifth Dynasty, with its complex and effective administrative systems, is considered to be the high point for the centralization of the Old Kingdom government.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Old Kingdom of Egypt, a god-king based in Memphis extended his reach along the Nile river through a network of royal centres, military towers and agricultural domains.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Few documents survive from the period; what evidence there is suggests that Egypt had become a centrally planned and administered state.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> During the Third Dynasty, high positions within the central administration were characteristically ‒ but not exclusively ‒ the preserve of the king's family. A notable exception was the chancellor and high priest Imhotep, the architect of Djoser's famous funerary complex which housed (among other buildings) the Step Pyramid. During the Fourth Dynasty, the number of officials from outside the king's family increased within the Egyptian administration, a trend which peaked in the Fifth Dynasty when the vizier became a powerful figure in his own right.

[...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the surn rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-307" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-307">[307]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-308" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-308">[308]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-309" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-309">[309]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> Relatively detailed contemporary descriptions do not mention audiences, as suggested by Teeter's summary of the ritual <sup id="cite_ref-310" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-310">[310]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "Texts indicated that the priests who assisted in the daily offering service were drawn from the ranks of <i>wabs</i>, lectors, and God's Fathers, all of whom, in some time periods, were part-time priests (see Chapter 2).

[...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the surn rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-346" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-346">[346]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-347" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-347">[347]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-348" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-348">[348]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> Relatively detailed contemporary descriptions do not mention audiences, as suggested by Teeter's summary of the ritual <sup id="cite_ref-349" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-349">[349]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "Texts indicated that the priests who assisted in the daily offering service were drawn from the ranks of <i>wabs</i>, lectors, and God's Fathers, all of whom, in some time periods, were part-time priests (see Chapter 2).

over the spiritual powers of the animal world. A successful hunt qualified the hunter as a leader and it especially legitimized the power of the ruler or king (as, for example, the royal hunts portrayed on the chest of Tutankhamun or the hunting scenes of Ramesses III in Medinet Habu). The importance of the hunt in qualifying the powers of Egypt's ruler resulted in an eventual reservation of the hunt as a privilege for the king. For example, during the height of the Old Kingdom, only the king was allowed to go hunting equipped with bow and arrow, and he had the reserved right to hunt specific game animals—above all the wild bull and the lion. Other instances of royal hunting privileges included the harpooning of the hippopotamus in the Nile Delta's marshes, bird-hunting with throw sticks in the papyrus thicket, and the spear-hunting of fish with two-pronged spears. "In the hunting scenes of private tombs from the Old Kingdom, the tomb owner was not shown as the hunter. He participated in the hunt only as a spectator, while the members of his household joined as helpers (for example, in leading the hounds, handling the bent sticks, or lassoing game). Only during the fifth dynasty do nonroyal tomb owners join actively in the hunt (the first documented examples being Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep in Saqqara), where the first depictions of fishing and of bird-hunting in the papyrus thicket were also found. The nonroyal tomb owner in his role as hunter was then given the same qualifying symbols as the ruler. The adaptation of royal hunting privileges for nonroyal tomb owners became evident toward the end of the Old Kingdom, when they were shown hunting with bow and arrow (the first known depiction is the rock tomb of Ankehtifi in Moʿalla). "The ritualistic interpretation of the hunt in ancient Egypt means that hunting was not considered a sport or recreation. An evaluation of hunting as a sport is possible only after the rituals have lost meaning; thus, during the Middle Kingdom, the king and his noble officials went hunting for the first time as a recreation. The concept of open and closed seasons for hunting was unknown to the Egyptians. In depictions of hunting scenes from the Old and the Middle Kingdom, the hunt was portrayed mostly in spring—in the mating season and when the young are born. "[...] "There is very little documentation for trapping in the historic period, in which animals were caught either dead or alive in traps, nets, pits, tight enclosures, and other manmade structures. In an Old Kingdom tomb, two lions were shown being transported in cages on sleighs, and they were probably caught by trapping. In the historic period, most hunts took place as a single-file ambush, in which hunters with varying types of equipment participated. Hounds (and probably hunting leopards) were also used. Many depictions document that the ambush took place in the flat, open landscape of the desert. Fences and nets were erected to close off the area on two sides, with lateral barricades set up parallel. From the opposite open sides, the hunters and beaters would approach with their hounds, herding the game with cries and by beating sticks. While the royal hunter shot the choicest game (wild bull and lion) with bow and arrow, the other participants fell upon the game with bent clubs, axes, or lassos; some caught it with bare hands. "[...] "The exaggerated accounts of royal prowess in the hunt cannot be taken as 'huntsman's slang,' because such accounts were written in order to praise the king. The victorious hunt of the king metaphorically made 'game' of Egypt's enemies, and they fled in horror from the attacking king.
