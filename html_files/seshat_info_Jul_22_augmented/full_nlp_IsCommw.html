The vast majority of Iceland is situated in UTM zones 28 W and 27 V.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IsCommw] 'An island covering 103,000 km., Iceland is located in the North Atlantic Ocean just south of the Arctic Circle on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These geological conditions produce a dramatic environment with a combination of volcanism and glacial activity. At the beginning of the Holocene the island was completely glaciated, and a number of large glaciers still exist. The interior of the land is barren plateau, and habitation has been largely limited to the coastal valleys and interior lowlands. Seasonal variation in daylight is extreme. Around the summer solstice the sun only sets briefly, and it is never dark. In the winter the sun only rises for a few hours and is low enough on the southern horizon that deep valleys may not have direct sunlight for months. Despite its sub-arctic location, the climate in Iceland is moderate due to the Gulf Stream. Mean temperatures for Reykjavík from 1961-1990 were 10.6° C. in July and -0.5° C. in January. Temperatures were probably slightly warmer during the climatic optimum. Precipitation throughout the year is high, in excess of 800 mm/annum.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IsCommw] 'Precipitation is quite variable but generally high in the south but much lower in the north. Overall it ranges from about 400 to more than 2000 mm, around 800 in Reykjavík.

When focusing on the peak date in political terms there are two options. The older literature favours the period of the late tenth and early eleventh century. More recent scholars point to the twelfth century as this was a relatively peaceful period. The peak date in terms of literature is undoubtedly the period after 1220 CE. Accordingly, assigning a “peak date” serves no useful purpose here and is misleading.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IsCommw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 930-1262 CE ♥</b> 'Circa 930 CE the Alþingi (the general assembly or parliament which met every year in Summer at the Þingvellir) was established and this is traditionally seen as the starting point of the Icelandic Commonwealth. The choice for 1262 CE as the end date of the Icelandic Commonwealth is based upon a widely accepted consensus. Whereas the period 1258 CE to 1264 CE can be seen as a transition period, in 1262 CE the Alþingi agreed to recognize the King of Norway as their sovereign. This was not the result of an invasion, but a voluntary act of the Alþingi and the leaders of all 39 Goðar. Goði (pl. goðar) refers to 'chieftains'. The term goðorðsmaður (godordsman) had practically replaced the term goði in common use by the 12th century. The political unit was called gorðorð. However, by 1262 there were no longer 39 godordsmen (goðar) or indeed active goðorð in Iceland (and this number, although official according to the constitution as explained in Grágás, may never have been real). By the 13th century territorial lordships (héraðsríki) had replaced the goðorð in most places and although technically based on the goðorð they were quite different as political institutions.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IsCommw] eHRAF and Durrenberger provide general descriptions: 'Iceland was a new society, however Icelandic culture perpetuated many of the cultural standards from Scandinavia, especially Norway. While both Norse and Celtic peoples contributed to the founding population they had unequal impacts on the culture of Iceland. Celts appear to have been incorporated into Norse households and appear to have little lasting impact on the cultural and institutional developments that were predominantly Scandinavian in origin. The first settlers claimed lands and established dispersed farmsteads. Many of the economic practices were unsuitable to the fragile Icelandic environment and resulted in deforestation and land erosion, especially in the uplands. As population grew, settlement expanded, and new farmsteads were divided from previous land claims. In 930 A.D. the General Assembly (ALÞINGI) was founded, providing an institution integrating the entire island. The same assembly accepted Christianity as the religion of the land in 1000 A.D. The thirteenth century was a period of escalating conflict (STURLUNGAÖLD) chieftains attempted to exert control beyond their local regions. The system of autonomous chieftains ended after 1262 A.D. when Iceland came under Norwegian rule. The Viking Age expansion into the North Atlantic did not end at Iceland. In the late tenth century Eirík the Red led a major venture to colonize Greenland and his son, Leifur Eiríksson, has been credited with the European discovery of North America. Early Icelanders maintained close ties with Scandinavia and the British Isles. Continental trading and raiding expeditions were common activities for those with the means to take a share in a boat. Their travels sometimes took them as far as Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IsCommw] 'Norse settlers came to Iceland in the ninth century from Norway and the British Isles. The traditionally accepted date for the first permanent settlement is 870. Settlers claimed land on the uninhabited island and established an agricultural economy based largely on grass. They raised sheep, cattle, horses, and in some places, some grain as well. According to the Icelandic literary-historical tradition, the land was all claimed by 930 when the Alþing or general assembly was founded, thus marking the end of the period of settlement. In 1000, by a compromise decision of a single arbiter selected at the Alþing, Christianity became the religion of Iceland. In 1096 a tithe law was enacted at the Alþing. Early in the thirteenth century began a period of disorder known after the name of one of its prominent families as the Sturlung age. This period came to an end in 1262 when Icelanders agreed to acept the Norwegian king as their king. The three hundred or so years between the first settlement and 1262 is known as the Icelandic Commonwealth or Free State.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IsCommw] The view that the economic practices of the early settlers was unsuitable to the Icelandic environment is probleamtic: 'This is often claimed but is actually questionable. The settlement undoubtedly had a profound impact in the environment but this always happens when a farming population first appears. It does not follow that economic practices were “unsuitable.” Perhaps the environmental impact was simply unavoidable if people wanted to make a living as farmers in Iceland.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IsCommw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ nominal ♥</b> unknown/ nominal/ loose/ confederated state /unitary state 'It is important to keep in mind that Iceland as a whole (the ‘Commonwealth’) only had nominal centralization and was little more than a loose federation of smaller polities. However, the real political players were the godords (goðorð/chieftaincies) and, towards the end, the territorial lordships (héraðsríki/principalities). The latter can be regarded as emerging tiny centralized states. In some cases, complexity appears less when we consider the Commonwealth as a polity than if we were considering smaller units, especially the territorial lordships. Commonwealth Iceland could therefore be treated as a ‘quasi-polity’. However, this would make it difficult to describe a ‘typical’ polity within Iceland because there were two kinds. One could split the Commonwealth into two periods, the former characterized by godords and the latter by territorial lordships. Admittedly, the latter period would be a short one (1200-1262) although some territorial lordships existed before 1200 and some godords survived into the 13th century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IsCommw] The eminent political institutions of Commonwealth Iceland were the chieftaincy and its associated courts and assemblies: 'At the time of Iceland’s settlement, Norse people worshiped gods whom they called æsir (singular áss), and this religion left behind an extensive mythology in Icelandic literature. Thor seems to have been the most popular of the pagan gods in Iceland, although Odin is thought to have been the highest in rank. It appears that heathen worship was organized around a distinct class of chieftains called godar (singular godi), of which there were about 40. In the absence of royal power in Iceland, the godar were to form the ruling class in the country. By the end of the settlement period, a general Icelandic assembly, called the Althing, had been established and was held at midsummer on a site that came to be called Thingvellir. This assembly consisted of a law council (lögrétta), in which the godar made and amended the laws, and a system of courts of justice, in which householders, nominated by the godar, acted on the panels of judges. At the local level, three godar usually held a joint assembly in late spring at which a local court operated, again with judges nominated by the godar. All farmers were legally obliged to belong to a chieftaincy (godord) but theoretically were free to change their allegiance from one godi to another; the godar were allotted a corresponding right to expel a follower. Some scholars have seen in this arrangement a resemblance to the franchise in modern societies. On the other hand, there was no central authority to ensure that the farmers would be able to exercise their right in a democratic way. No one was vested with executive power over the country as a whole. In any case, no trace of democratic practice reached farther down the social scale than to the heads of farming households; women and workers (free or enslaved) had no role in the political system.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IsCommw] 'One of the peculiarities of early Iceland was the lack of formal state institutions. The legislature, extensive law code, and judicial system of local and higher courts left prosecution and the enforcement of settlements in the hands of individuals. From an early date, the country was divided into Quarters. Each quarter constituted a broad community with three assemblies (ÞINGS), with the exception of the Northern Quarter that had four, and a system of local courts. Once a year the General Assembly (ALÞINGI) met in the southwest of Iceland. Judicial cases that could not be resolved in local quarters were heard and the parliament (LÖGRÉTTA) convened. The parliament was the principal legislative institution and was responsible for the introduction and maintanence of law. It consisted of chieftains (GOÐAR) from the local quarters. After the conversion to Christianity, the two Icelandic bishops were each given a seat in the parliament. The institution of chieftaincy (GOÐORÐ) was the main locus of political leadership in the country. Originally there were 36 but this number was later expanded. Chieftaincies themselves were a form of property and could be alienated and even divided among multiple individuals. In some cases, individuals asserted power beyond the scope of the political system and controlled multiple chieftaincies. All independent farmers had to be affiliated with a chieftain, although they could choose among any of the chieftains in their quarter and could switch allegiances if they did not feel that their needs were being met. Other than a seat on the parliament, chieftains had few rights beyond those of other independent farmers and few institutional means of dominating others. Chieftains derived much of their authority from their ability to broker support as advocates for their constituents in legal disputes or feuds.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IsCommw] Households and communes functioned as primary economic units: 'The principal unit of social organization was the household. Those with rights to property, the farmer and his (or her) family, headed households. Large households incorporated a range of dependent labor: wage laborers, servants, and slaves. As an institution, slavery declined in the twelfth century and had probably disappeared sometime in the thirteenth century; however, social distinctions were maintained between self-sufficient farmers (either land-owners or renters) and the majority of the population who served as household labor. The main cooperative unit outside of the household was the commune (HREPPUR). The commune was a territorial unit including many households (20 or more). The commune's main functions were management of summer grazing lands, the cooperative round up of animals in the fall, and care for paupers who had no other household support. They also provided some insurance to households against fire or the loss of livestock.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IsCommw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> unknown/ none/ alliance/ nominal allegiance/ personal union/ vassalage Icelanders maintained vital commercial connections with Europeans and Scandinavians: 'The early Icelanders maintained commercial contacts with Europe and obtained goods from Scandinavia, England, the Norse Orkneys, and the Netherlands. The majority of trade, however, was with Norway, both for Norwegian goods and for foreign goods obtained by Norwegian merchants. The limited resources, especially in terms of raw materials for manufactured goods, made Iceland highly dependent on imported goods. Even before the decline and cessation of grain production in Iceland it is unlikely that Iceland ever produced enough cereals to meet its own needs. Of special significance in a feasting economy, grain and malt were essential to ale production. After Christianization imported wine also become essential for the celebration of communion. Many higher quality iron products, for example weapons and armor, could not be produced from local sources and were imported, mostly in finished forms. Other metals - brass, tin, lead, gold, silver, and bronze - were unavailable locally as well as steatite for utensils and stone suitable for making whetstones. Iceland had a limited number of exportable resources and goods. Homespun woolen cloth was the principal export and was a common standard of value in local exchanges. Sulfur, unavailable from any continental source, was a valuable commodity. Falcons and various animal skins - sheep, fox, and cat - were marketable as were cheese and possibly butter. Fish, the current mainstay of the Icelandic economy was not a significant export item in early Iceland.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IsCommw] The Commonwealth as such maintained no permanent external alliances, although the Norwegian crown had its allies among the chieftains: 'Isolated in the North Atlantic, Iceland had few external conflicts. Individual Icelanders were occasionally involved in conflict when outside the country and also sometimes served in foreign militaries. During the late tenth century, the Norwegian king was a champion of the Christian movement in Iceland and often attempted to assert his influence, although this was largely limited to Icelanders in Norway. Likewise, the ultimately successful attempts to incorporate Iceland under the Norwegian monarchy were mostly played out through alliances with individual Icelanders.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IsCommw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Early Settlers ♥</b> The first permanent Viking settlers arrived in the 9th century: 'Iceland apparently has no prehistory. According to stories written down some 250 years after the event, the country was discovered and settled by Norse people in the Viking Age. The oldest source, Íslendingabók (The Book of the Icelanders), written about 1130, sets the period of settlement at about ad 870-930. The other main source, Landnámabók (The Book of Settlements), of 12th-century origin but known only in later versions, states explicitly that the first permanent settler, Ingólfr Arnarson, came from Norway to Iceland to settle in the year 874. He chose as his homestead a site that he named Reykjavík, which he farmed with his wife, Hallveig Fródadóttir. The Book of Settlements then enumerates more than 400 settlers who sailed with their families, servants, and slaves to Iceland to stake claims to land. Most of the settlers came from Norway, but some came from other Nordic countries and from the Norse Viking Age settlements in the British Isles. A layer of tephra (volcanic ash) that in many places coincides with the earliest remains of human habitation in Iceland has been identified in Greenland ice and dated to about 870. Archaeological finds also support the documentary evidence and place Iceland among Norse Viking Age settlements of the late 9th or early 10th century. The Icelandic language testifies to the same origin; Icelandic is a Nordic language and is most closely related to the dialects of western Norway. Although the island was not populated until the Viking Age, Iceland probably had been known to people long before that time. The 4th-century-bc Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia (Marseille) described a northern country that he called Thule, located six days’ sailing distance north of Britain. In the 8th century Irish hermits who had begun to sail to Iceland in search of solitude also called the island Thule. It is unknown, however, if Pytheas and the hermits were describing the same island. According to the early Icelandic sources, some Irish monks were living in Iceland when the Nordic settlers arrived, but the monks soon left because they were unwilling to share the country with heathens.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IsCommw] 'By the end of the settlement period, a general Icelandic assembly, called the Althing, had been established and was held at midsummer on a site that came to be called Thingvellir. This assembly consisted of a law council (lögrétta), in which the godar made and amended the laws, and a system of courts of justice, in which householders, nominated by the godar, acted on the panels of judges. At the local level, three godar usually held a joint assembly in late spring at which a local court operated, again with judges nominated by the godar. All farmers were legally obliged to belong to a chieftaincy (godord) but theoretically were free to change their allegiance from one godi to another; the godar were allotted a corresponding right to expel a follower. Some scholars have seen in this arrangement a resemblance to the franchise in modern societies. On the other hand, there was no central authority to ensure that the farmers would be able to exercise their right in a democratic way. No one was vested with executive power over the country as a whole. In any case, no trace of democratic practice reached farther down the social scale than to the heads of farming households; women and workers (free or enslaved) had no role in the political system.'

In Norway royal power gained strength in the early 13th century when the king set out to unite all Norwegian Viking Age settlements under his reign. By that time about 10 powerful godar, belonging to some five families, held almost all the chieftaincies in Iceland, and by mid-century these chieftaincies were engaged in a bloody struggle for power. Finally, in 1262-64, all Icelandic chieftains and representatives of the farmers were persuaded to swear allegiance to the king of Norway, partly in the hope that he would bring peace to the country.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IsCommw] The persistence of internal strife had contributed to this decision: 'From the twelfth century onwards, especially during the Sturlung Period, a few families managed to control all the goðorð in Iceland. [Page 17] Increasingly the goðorð became territorial units; the most powerful chiefs sought to consolidate their position, appropriating land and property on a large scale. Sigurðsson (ch. 12) discusses the evolution of ríki (‘small states’, new political units with rather clear territorial boundaries), beginning in some parts of Iceland in the eleventh century and culminating almost everywhere by the middle of the thirteenth century. Sigurðsson estimates that by year 1220 perhaps only five chieftains ruled the whole country, whereas during the tenth century the number of chieftains would normally have been no less than fifty. He explores the changing place and dilemmas of friendship, a voluntary relationship based on trust, in the context of increasing concentration of power. Clearly, the bond between chieftain and followers became less personal than before. Due to increased confrontations between the major chieftains and the relative absence of potential mediators, ‘friends of both’ as they were called, there was a rapid escalation in violence, brutality, and warfare. Because of internal conflicts and the expansive policy of the Norwegian state, the Commonwealth finally came to an end. After fierce battles the chieftains agreed in 1262 to cede their authority to the king of Norway. Eyrbyggja saga seems to compare and personify the political systems of the early and late Commonwealth period; the struggle between the two main goðar in the story, Arnkell and Snorri, reflects the changing times (see Olason 1989, 1971:19-20; Turner 1985:112-17; Pálsson 1991b). Arnkell signifies the reality of the early Commonwealth, he is a heroic big man who mobilizes support by personal charms and his obituary is full of praise; he was “a great loss to everybody … good tempered, brave and determined” (ÍF 4, ch. 37). Snorri, on the other hand, represents the reality of the chiefs during the thirteenth century; he is a clever politician who controls his army but does not fight himself. Durrenberger suggests (1990:77), citing Fried (1967), that these saga accounts of the political development of the Commonwealth add to the general credibility of the sagas; they indicate precisely the kind of history one would expect from the ethnography and dynamics of stratified societies without states.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IsCommw] Iceland maintained a degree of autonomy during the Norwegian period: 'To a large extent, Iceland was ruled separately from Norway. It had its own law code, and the Althing continued to be held at Thingvellir, though mainly as a court of justice. Most of the royal officials who succeeded the chieftains were Icelanders. In 1380 the Norwegian monarchy entered into a union with the Danish crown, but that change did not affect Iceland’s status within the realm as a personal skattland (“tax land”) of the crown.'

However, language and culture were strongly Norse.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Icelandic Commonwealth (Icel. <i>íslenska þjóðveldið</i>), occasionally called 'free state' or 'republic' (not to be confused with the modern republic) was established in 930 CE according to 12th-century historical documents. It was the first polity to cover the whole of Iceland and the smaller surrounding islands. Its territory did not change during its lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Icelandic society during the Commonwealth was strongly rural and never developed significant urbanization. However, centres of power, wealth and learning gradually emerged in the two bishoprics, monasteries and the homes of the greatest secular lords.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Iceland was mostly pagan in the early period but Christianity was accepted in 1000 and the first bishopric established in 1056. This not only brought Iceland closer to Europe but also introduced European culture and learning, and from the early 12th century the Icelanders started to produce significant works of literature in the vernacular but written in the Latin alphabet (sagas). The sagas are usually (at least recently) considered the greatest achievement of the Commonwealth and they flourished in the 13th century (both before and after 1262). However, this was also a time of war and loss of independence, making it difficult to assign it a 'peak' status.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There are no reliable figures for the total population in Iceland during this period. Common estimates range from 5,000-20,000 in 930 to 40,000-70,000 at the end. The only statistic that is somewhat reliable states that the number of tax-paying farmers around 1100 AD was 4,560. The relationship between this number and the whole population is uncertain.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Commonwealth functioned as a federation of smaller political units with no fixed borders, the godords/chieftaincies (<i>goðorð</i>), with alliances between households led by a chieftain (<i>goði</i> or <i>goðorðsmaður</i>). Laws were common to all and there was a common judiciary system. In Lögrétta leaders of all the godords met once a year to decide on laws, forming the most important part of the proceedings of the <i>Alþingi</i> ('general assembly'), held in summer at Thingvellir. However, there was no common executive branch of government, leaving the godords quite autonomous.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The godords started to congeal into territorial lordships with fixed borders in the 12th century (the first one perhaps in the late 11th century), but this process was most rapid around 1200 CE and by 1220 they covered most of Iceland. These lordships functioned as practically independent tiny polities (or 'proto-states') and proceeded to fight each other for supremacy. The ensuing civil wars (<i>Sturlungaöld</i>) ended in 1262 when the Icelanders swore allegiance to the Norwegian crown.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>This description was provided by Axel Kristinsson and edited by Jenny Reddish.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Eva Brandl ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Editor ♣ Daniel Mullins ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣  Axel Kristissen; Arni D Juliusson ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IsCommw&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 103,000 ♥</b> in squared kilometers 'Iceland is an island situated just to the south of the Polar Circle in the mid-North Atlantic Ocean.

The relative proportion of Norse (primarily Norwegian) and Celtic (from the northern British Isles) contributions to the original Icelandic population has been debated.

The point is that there may have been as much as about a hundred thousand hectares of land suitable for homefield pastures, [Page 253] sufficient to support a hundred thousand individuals as members of independent households, according to Commonwealth criteria.

Farms also laid claim to special resources even when they were not on farmstead lands such as forests, turf and peat cutting areas, and drift rights on beaches.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_IsCommw] The farming household was the primary social and economic unit of Commonwealth-Era Iceland: 'The principal unit of social organization was the household. Those with rights to property, the farmer and his (or her) family, headed households. Large households incorporated a range of dependent labor: wage laborers, servants, and slaves. As an institution, slavery declined in the twelfth century and had probably disappeared sometime in the thirteenth century; however, social distinctions were maintained between self-sufficient farmers (either land-owners or renters) and the majority of the population who served as household labor. The main cooperative unit outside of the household was the commune (HREPPUR). The commune was a territorial unit including many households (20 or more). The commune's main functions were management of summer grazing lands, the cooperative round up of animals in the fall, and care for paupers who had no other household support. They also provided some insurance to households against fire or the loss of livestock.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_IsCommw] The settlement pattern was dispersed: 'Because agriculture was the chief economic activity, the population of Iceland was evenly distributed throughout the inhabitable parts of the country until the end of the 19th century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_IsCommw] 'The requirements of livestock herding insured that Icelandic land-use was characterized by low population densities, a dispersed settlement pattern, and large farmsteads. Within such farmsteads land was divided into spatial units reflecting different levels of management associated with homefields, hay-producing areas, and outer pastures. Outbuildings associated with the seasonal components of Icelandic transhumant pastoralism were scattered throughout these various land-use areas and in the upland heaths surrounding zones of intensive occupation (Bredahl-Petersen 1967; Hastrup 1985).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_IsCommw] Homesteads belonged to assembly districts: 'About 960 this system was changed. The country was divided into four quarters, Each quarter, except the Northern, had three assembly-districts, each with three chieftains. The Northern quarter had four assembly districts. Now people had to select a chieftain from within their own quarter, and an assembly site was named for each district. Cases had to be heard in the disputants' assembly, or if they were from different assembly-districts, in the quarter court at the meeting of the Alþing. Unanimity was required for judgements. Cases that could not be resolved in quarter courts were referred to a fifth-court (established about 1004) where a simple majority of judges could decide a case. By 1117, when the laws were written in Grágás, not all local assemblies were functioning. Some had been consolidated into others (Jóhannesson 1974:238).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_IsCommw] Chieftains and other leaders relied on additional household labour, leading to substantially larger homesteads among elites: 'Although I would prefer to flout the conventional wisdom that slavery had all but died out by the eleventh century (Karras 1988a), the household laborers that replaced them in the Commonwealth period were numerous. When Þórðr kakali returns to Iceland Kolbeinn ungi immediately sends out thirty húsmenn to look for him in Eyjafjörðr. Þorsteinn Cod-biter had sixty free men in his household (Eyrbyggja saga, ÍF 4, ch. 11); Guðmundr the Mighty had one hundred (Brennu-Njáls saga, ÍF 12, ch. 113); Sörla þáttr (Ljósvetninga saga), ÍF 10, ch. 1:109); Bishop Páll's household at Skálholt (ca 1200) had seventy to eighty residents, and a household with eighty has been discussed above. It is probably not unfair to say that by the Commonwealth period the majority of the wealth of great bœndur and goðar was the product of teams of house-men and women.'

The existence of parallel hierarchies complicates matters. The communes (hreppar) existed independently from the godords and, unlike them, were territorial units. Typically there would be one or two members of the gentry living on their manor-farms in each commune and they would often, even usually, have a sphere of influence albeit an informal one and not necessarily concurrent with the commune. However, there is a broad four-tier hierarchy which incorporates both formal and informal elements, although the levels were not the same throughout. We can summarize it like this: 930-1200: 1) Free Farmers 2) Goðar 3) Local assemblies 4) Alþingi. Note: The local assemblies may not have been formalized until around 960 but probably functioned in some sense even before that. 950/1050-1200 (concurrently with above): 1) Free Farmers 2) Hreppar 3) Local Assemblies 4) Alþingi. Note: We don’t know when the hreppar were established but it must have been in the 10th or 11th centuries. 1200-1262 1) Free Farmers 2) Hreppar 3) Territorial lordships 4) Alþingi. Note: The local assemblies were usually abolished with the emergence of territorial lordships that often covered approximately the same area.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_IsCommw]  The general assembly of chieftains was the highest political institution of the Commonwealth: 'At the time of Iceland’s settlement, Norse people worshiped gods whom they called æsir (singular áss), and this religion left behind an extensive mythology in Icelandic literature. Thor seems to have been the most popular of the pagan gods in Iceland, although Odin is thought to have been the highest in rank. It appears that heathen worship was organized around a distinct class of chieftains called godar (singular godi), of which there were about 40. In the absence of royal power in Iceland, the godar were to form the ruling class in the country. By the end of the settlement period, a general Icelandic assembly, called the Althing, had been established and was held at midsummer on a site that came to be called Thingvellir. This assembly consisted of a law council (lögrétta), in which the godar made and amended the laws, and a system of courts of justice, in which householders, nominated by the godar, acted on the panels of judges. At the local level, three godar usually held a joint assembly in late spring at which a local court operated, again with judges nominated by the godar. All farmers were legally obliged to belong to a chieftaincy (godord) but theoretically were free to change their allegiance from one godi to another; the godar were allotted a corresponding right to expel a follower. Some scholars have seen in this arrangement a resemblance to the franchise in modern societies. On the other hand, there was no central authority to ensure that the farmers would be able to exercise their right in a democratic way. No one was vested with executive power over the country as a whole. In any case, no trace of democratic practice reached farther down the social scale than to the heads of farming households; women and workers (free or enslaved) had no role in the political system.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_IsCommw] The country was divided into quarters served by local assemblies: 'One of the peculiarities of early Iceland was the lack of formal state institutions. The legislature, extensive law code, and judicial system of local and higher courts left prosecution and the enforcement of settlements in the hands of individuals. From an early date, the country was divided into Quarters. Each quarter constituted a broad community with three assemblies (ÞINGS), with the exception of the Northern Quarter that had four, and a system of local courts. Once a year the General Assembly (ALÞINGI) met in the southwest of Iceland. Judicial cases that could not be resolved in local quarters were heard and the parliament (LÖGRÉTTA) convened. The parliament was the principal legislative institution and was responsible for the introduction and maintanence of law. It consisted of chieftains (GOÐAR) from the local quarters. After the conversion to Christianity, the two Icelandic bishops were each given a seat in the parliament. The institution of chieftaincy (GOÐORÐ) was the main locus of political leadership in the country. Originally there were 36 but this number was later expanded. Chieftaincies themselves were a form of property and could be alienated and even divided among multiple individuals. In some cases, individuals asserted power beyond the scope of the political system and controlled multiple chieftaincies. All independent farmers had to be affiliated with a chieftain, although they could choose among any of the chieftains in their quarter and could switch allegiances if they did not feel that their needs were being met. Other than a seat on the parliament, chieftains had few rights beyond those of other independent farmers and few institutional means of dominating others. Chieftains derived much of their authority from their ability to broker support as advocates for their constituents in legal disputes or feuds.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_IsCommw] Chieftains relied on the support of farmers and armed followers: 'Following the establishment of the Althing in 930, executive power at the regional level was vested in the goðar, whose possession of goðorð and common participation in the judicial and legislative branches of the general assembly defined them as chieftains. However, the chieftains were not linked hierarchically. After A.D. 965 Iceland was divided into thirteen assembly districts, each with three chieftainships and a district assembly site. The assembly districts were in turn grouped into four quarters. While goðar were tethered to particular districts by law, the political office of chieftainship, the goðorð, did not imply control over a defined territorial unit. It was instead a shifting nexus of personal, negotiated alliances between a chieftain and those bœndur who became his supporters or pingmenn through public oaths of allegiance.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_IsCommw] Conflicts between rival chieftains were a major source of internal strife before the onset of Norwegian rule. During the Sturlung period, the godords became concentrated in the hands of a few powerful magnates: 'It may be tempting to regard the Icelandic Commonwealth as a permanent structure, for, after all, it seems to be sealed in the poorly-dated or undated ‘ethnographic present’ of the sagas. But any social system is necessarily a product of history, representing a particular moment in time. We know for sure that the Commonwealth underwent important changes before it eventually ‘collapsed.’ Not only was there important ecological and demographic change and, as a result, mounting pressure on land (Gelsinger 1981; McGovern et al. 1988), access to resources was increasingly determined by the political manoeuvres and battles of competing goðar. According to the near contemporary Sturlunga saga, the battles between contesting leaders involved an ever larger number of men-no less than two thousand fought in the biggest one, at Örlygsstaðir in year 1238. To increase the number of followers, each goði had to maximize his fund of power at the cost of competitors. Feasts and gifts, a measure of the generosity of the goði, and the display of imported luxury goods, must have been an additional burden to the household, at a time of economic decline. One saga describes a large wedding feast extending through a whole week (SS 3, ch. 17:22). The only way to meet the costs involved was to collect taxes, hire additional labor, and seek further support from followers. With the Tithe Law, the tax law enacted in 1096, the ownership of churches became an important source of wealth and power. Furthermore, slavery seems to have disappeared early (see Karras, ch. 17), probably because recruiting freemen who had insufficient land was less costly than maintaining slaves. This meant that soon there was a reserve of labor; on one occasion, in 1208, a group of more than 300 unemployed people, many of whom were strong and healthy, followed a travelling bishop in the hope of some sustenance (see G. Karlsson 1975:27).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_IsCommw] 'From the twelfth century onwards, especially during the Sturlung Period, a few families managed to control all the goðorð in Iceland. [Page 17] Increasingly the goðorð became territorial units; the most powerful chiefs sought to consolidate their position, appropriating land and property on a large scale. Sigurðsson (ch. 12) discusses the evolution of ríki (‘small states’, new political units with rather clear territorial boundaries), beginning in some parts of Iceland in the eleventh century and culminating almost everywhere by the middle of the thirteenth century. Sigurðsson estimates that by year 1220 perhaps only five chieftains ruled the whole country, whereas during the tenth century the number of chieftains would normally have been no less than fifty. He explores the changing place and dilemmas of friendship, a voluntary relationship based on trust, in the context of increasing concentration of power. Clearly, the bond between chieftain and followers became less personal than before. Due to increased confrontations between the major chieftains and the relative absence of potential mediators, ‘friends of both’ as they were called, there was a rapid escalation in violence, brutality, and warfare. Because of internal conflicts and the expansive policy of the Norwegian state, the Commonwealth finally came to an end. After fierce battles the chieftains agreed in 1262 to cede their authority to the king of Norway. Eyrbyggja saga seems to compare and personify the political systems of the early and late Commonwealth period; the struggle between the two main goðar in the story, Arnkell and Snorri, reflects the changing times (see Olason 1989, 1971:19-20; Turner 1985:112-17; Pálsson 1991b). Arnkell signifies the reality of the early Commonwealth, he is a heroic big man who mobilizes support by personal charms and his obituary is full of praise; he was “a great loss to everybody … good tempered, brave and determined” (ÍF 4, ch. 37). Snorri, on the other hand, represents the reality of the chiefs during the thirteenth century; he is a clever politician who controls his army but does not fight himself. Durrenberger suggests (1990:77), citing Fried (1967), that these saga accounts of the political development of the Commonwealth add to the general credibility of the sagas; they indicate precisely the kind of history one would expect from the ethnography and dynamics of stratified societies without states.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_IsCommw] The household headed by a property-holding farmer was the primary unit of local social and economic organization: 'The principal unit of social organization was the household. Those with rights to property, the farmer and his (or her) family, headed households. Large households incorporated a range of dependent labor: wage laborers, servants, and slaves. As an institution, slavery declined in the twelfth century and had probably disappeared sometime in the thirteenth century; however, social distinctions were maintained between self-sufficient farmers (either land-owners or renters) and the majority of the population who served as household labor.

There is no data on the number of religious levels for Nordic paganism. Christianity (in the form of Catholicism) was introduced around 1000 CE. In 1056 CE Christianity was officially accepted as the official religion. The conversion was largely the result of a top-down decision. There is no data available on a popular Christian movement in the years before 1056 CE. The Church followed the standardized Catholic hierarchy consisting of a bishop, (deacons), and priests. Before 1056 the code should probably be 1 as we have no indications of religious hierarchy in either pagan or early Christian times.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_IsCommw] Christianity was introduced around 1000ce: 'Iceland was settled before any significant impact of Christianity in Scandinavia and the early Icelanders were pagans. Many of the Celtic people incorporated in the foundational population were probably Christian but this appears to have had little impact in the society in general. Pre-Christian religious practices are known largely by poetic and literary sources, all recorded during the Christian era, and some traces of material culture. These sources depict a rich cosmology including the Norse pantheon of gods and giants. Thor held a place of special significance based on his frequent inclusion in person and place names. The Icelanders inhabited an environment rich in supernatural entities including trolls, elves, and ghosts. Prescience and magical abilities were often attributed to individuals. In 1000 A.D., responding to a combination of internal and foreign pressure exerted by the Norwegian king, the Icelanders meeting at the General Assembly decided to adopt Christianity as the common religion. Hencefor th Iceland was officially Christian although many of the traditional beliefs remained.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_IsCommw] 'By the end of the 10th century, the Norwegians were forced by their king, Olaf I Tryggvason, to accept Christianity. The king also sent missionaries to Iceland who, according to 12th-century sources, were highly successful in converting the Icelanders. In 999 or 1000 the Althing made a peaceful decision that all Icelanders should become Christians. In spite of this decision, the godar retained their political role, and many of them probably built their own churches. Some were ordained, and as a group they seem to have closely controlled the organization of the new religion. Two bishoprics were established, one at Skálholt in 1056 and the other at Hólar in 1106. Literate Christian culture also transformed lay life. Codification of the law was begun in 1117-18. Later the Icelanders began to write sagas, which were to reach their pinnacle of literary achievement in the next century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_IsCommw] During the pagan period, chiefs frequently fulfilled religious functions: 'Pagan ceremonies were varied, and the details handed down by later Christian texts are not clear. Sacrificial rites performed by household heads or chieftains played a part in the ritual. Certain rituals seeking the intercession of spirits for divination or assistance (SEIÐR) were largely performed by women. Special cultic sites or buildings (HOFS) existed but religious ceremonies were not limited to these settings. Sacrificial activities were banned shortly after the conversion and Christian ceremonies such as baptism and communion were introduced.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_IsCommw] The offices of priest and bishop were introduced after the formal adoption of Christianity, but chiefs and farmers remained primary actors in the performance of rituals: 'The political institution of chieftaincy (GOÐORÐ) was rooted in religious function, a priestly office of intermediary between the community and supernatural forces. It is unclear the degree to which the role of chieftains had been secularized by the occupation of Iceland, but it is likely chiefs played a continued role in local religious activities by performing rites and sacrifices. Religious activities were not exclusive to chieftains. Individuals played a variety of intermediary between the mundane and supernatural roles including private devotions, divination, and sorcery. The conversion to Christianity brought with it the institutions of priest and bishop to Iceland. Throughout much of the early period, the institutional power of the church was weak. Churches were located on privately owned farmlands and were built and maintained by the local farmers who maintained a priest or served as priest himself. The early farm churches were small and probably served little more than the household and immediate neighbors.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_IsCommw] The few Icelandic bishops of the Commonwealth period resembled chiefs in their reliance on additional household labour: 'Although I would prefer to flout the conventional wisdom that slavery had all but died out by the eleventh century (Karras 1988a), the household laborers that replaced them in the Commonwealth period were numerous. When Þórðr kakali returns to Iceland Kolbeinn ungi immediately sends out thirty húsmenn to look for him in Eyjafjörðr.

It is probably not unfair to say that by the Commonwealth period the majority of the wealth of great bœndur and goðar was the product of teams of house-men and women.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_IsCommw] The interests of the church and the 'secular' elites were in conflict during the phase of intensified internal strife that preceded the Norwegian period: 'As I have mentioned earlier, the era of the Sturlungs was a period bordering on civil war, in which the Sturlunga family was central. What kinds of sentiments would the author of the Eyrbyggja saga, who must have been close to the Sturlungs, be likely to express? Although some of the Sturlung family's most prominent members in Norway had solemnly obliged themselves to further the king's cause, they nevertheless tended to forget the vow when they returned to Iceland. As also was the case with other chieftains, they preferred to act independently of the king. Some of the Sturlungs clearly harbored dreams of being Icelandic kings; others preferred a society governed by an oligarchy of Icelandic [Page 144] chieftains. In both cases sentiments would have been against the Norwegian king's growing influence in Iceland. The Sturlungs were therefore likely to express anti-royal feelings, even though they might admire the king's person. As the aristocracy was competing with the Church, we may also assume that the Sturlungs were against the ascending dominance of the Church in juridical, economic, and moral matters (Hastrup 1985, ch. 7). Two of the Sturlungs had in fact been instrumental in removing bishop Ari Guðmundsson from his bishopric in northern Iceland in 1222 (ST 1:287-298). As representatives of the dominant class, the Sturlungs were also likely to express contempt towards the lower classes. We find all these structurally determined resentments in Eyrbyggja saga.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_IsCommw] The bishops received seats in the parliament of the general assembly: 'One of the peculiarities of early Iceland was the lack of formal state institutions. The legislature, extensive law code, and judicial system of local and higher courts left prosecution and the enforcement of settlements in the hands of individuals.

The chieftains (and sometimes the greater farmers) called up the free population on an ad hoc basis. Three levels are attested for the late Commonwealth. We have clear evidence of 13th century warlords commissioning lieutenants that commanded groups of retainers or units of conscripted warrior-farmers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_IsCommw] Some Icelanders joined foreign armies abroad: 'Isolated in the North Atlantic, Iceland had few external conflicts. Individual Icelanders were occasionally involved in conflict when outside the country and also sometimes served in foreign militaries. During the late tenth century, the Norwegian king was a champion of the Christian movement in Iceland and often attempted to assert his influence, although this was largely limited to Icelanders in Norway. Likewise, the ultimately successful attempts to incorporate Iceland under the Norwegian monarchy were mostly played out through alliances with individual Icelanders.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_IsCommw] Chieftains relied on an entourage of armed followers: 'Those who had access to sufficient resources to support a household were the tax paying farmers. Each of them had to be a follower of a chieftain from his own quarter, and only the tax paying farmers could make the decision as to which he would follow. All of his dependents - tenants and renters - went with him. However they got it, chieftains were dependent on farmers for support - to feed their increasingly large personal followings or armies, to support them at assemblies, and to accompany them on raids on other chieftains or their followers. As we have seen, without such support, without the ability to mass force, claims to ownership of land, which defined the class system as well as the forms of appropriation, had no force. Farmers had to rely on some chieftain to be able to defend their claims to property, though, as we have seen, this might often lead to the loss of the property. Chieftains had to rely on farmers to enforce their followers' claims and their own, as well as to expand their territories into others'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_IsCommw] Armed supporters were required to enforce legal and political claims: 'Claims of inheritance were only worth as much as the armed support behind them. This follows from the fact that claims to ownership, property, were only worth as much as the armed support behind them. This meant that to assert any claim to ownership, whether by inheritance or any other means, one had to back the claim with armed force. Chieftains were focal points for concentrating force to protect and to forward claims to property.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_IsCommw] 'In Commonwealth Iceland there was a system of extraction based on claims to ownership of property, on concepts of the unproblematic [Page 161] differential access to resources in favour of a chieftainly class. The chieftains were unwilling to subordinate themselves to state institutions to protect their privileged positions. The consequence was stratification without a state, the contradiction of an economic system based on property relationships without a congruent institutional system to enforce them. Ownership was as sound as the force one could muster to defend it. There was a complex system of law, but it was all just so much labyrinthine rhetoric in the face of the stark reality that power decided. As slavery diminished, claimants to land enlarged their holdings by using wage labour and tenancy arrangements to work them. To support their claims, they had to increase their power by enlarging their entourages.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_IsCommw] Chieftains also relied on farmers willing to support them economically and militarily: 'Relations between chieftains and farmers were not, however, smooth. Chieftains had their “own” estates to support their establishments, and some maintained followings of armed men, but this was a difficult proposition, since it added consumers to the household without adding production. The chieftains had to rely on their following of farmers to support them with both arms and supplies. This was one component of any farmer's household fund, his “rent” so to speak, his expenditures for travel and support for his chieftain, without which his chieftain or another would take his land and livestock. In addition, expeditions took labor from the farm and put the farmer's life at risk. Even so, a farmer's claims to land were not secure, since his chieftain might abandon him, another more powerful chieftain might claim his land, or simply take it, or a farmer might lose his land in a re-alignment of alliances among chieftains, which were frequent.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_IsCommw] The interests of chieftains and farmers were often in conflict: 'There was a basic conflict between chieftains' increasing demands for demonstrations of force in support of claims to ownership and the subsistence demands, the economic roles, of farmers. Chieftains were not beyond using coercion to insure support as the following incident relates. [...] In spite of this contradiction, farmers had to rely on some chieftain in order to maintain their claims to land. While the inheritance customs codified in Grágás seem quite orderly in Hastrup's (1985) analysis, inheritance of land is often hotly disputed in the Saga of the Icelanders. One who wanted another's land could often find a third party with some inheritance claim, and acquire the claim on which to base a legitimation for taking the land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_IsCommw] Competition between chieftains was a major source of internal strife before the onset of the Norwegian period: 'It may be tempting to regard the Icelandic Commonwealth as a permanent structure, for, after all, it seems to be sealed in the poorly-dated or undated ‘ethnographic present’ of the sagas. But any social system is necessarily a product of history, representing a particular moment in time.

Feasts and gifts, a measure of the generosity of the goði, and the display of imported luxury goods, must have been an additional burden to the household, at a time of economic decline. One saga describes a large wedding feast extending through a whole week (SS 3, ch. 17:22). The only way to meet the costs involved was to collect taxes, hire additional labor, and seek further support from followers. With the Tithe Law, the tax law enacted in 1096, the ownership of churches became an important source of wealth and power. Furthermore, slavery seems to have disappeared early (see Karras, ch. 17), probably because recruiting freemen who had insufficient land was less costly than maintaining slaves. This meant that soon there was a reserve of labor; on one occasion, in 1208, a group of more than 300 unemployed people, many of whom were strong and healthy, followed a travelling bishop in the hope of some sustenance (see G.

Grain was never a significant crop, and eventually its cultivation died out altogether. Fish also played an important role in subsistence.

Women were associated with the domestic activities of the household; however, they were also active in dairy production, even when this involved protracted stays at summer dairy stations in the highlands. Fishing and industries like charcoal making and smithing fell to men. Intensive seasonal tasks, such as hay cutting, drying, and storage, required the combined efforts of everyone in the household.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_IsCommw] Most household items and foodstuffs were either locally produced or imported from abroad: 'Early Iceland had a limited range of material resources for manufacturing. Clays suitable for ceramic production are largely unavailable in Iceland. Woodworking and carpentry were essential to construction and the many household items were fashioned from driftwood. Bog iron was used for most metalworking and required charcoal production for smelting and working. Spinning and weaving from wool was a ubiquitous household industry. Leather was another important material in the production of clothing and household goods. Ale was locally produced, largely from imported grains and salt was made from burning kelp and seaweed.'

All of his dependents - tenants and renters-went with him. However they got it, chieftains were dependent on farmers for support - to feed their increasingly large personal followings or armies, to support them at assemblies, and to accompany them on raids on other chieftains or their followers. As we have seen, without such support, without the ability to mass force, claims to ownership of land, which defined the class system as well as the forms of appropriation, had no force. Farmers had to rely on some chieftain to be able to defend their claims to property, though, as we have seen, this might often lead to the loss of the property. Chieftains had to rely on farmers to enforce their followers' claims and their own, as well as to expand their territories into others'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_IsCommw] Armed supporters were required to enforce legal and political claims: 'Claims of inheritance were only worth as much as the armed support behind them. This follows from the fact that claims to ownership, property, were only worth as much as the armed support behind them. This meant that to assert any claim to ownership, whether by inheritance or any other means, one had to back the claim with armed force. Chieftains were focal points for concentrating force to protect and to forward claims to property.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_IsCommw] Chieftains also relied on farmers willing to support them economically and militarily: 'Relations between chieftains and farmers were not, however, smooth. Chieftains had their “own” estates to support their establishments, and some maintained followings of armed men, but this was a difficult proposition, since it added consumers to the household without adding production. The chieftains had to rely on their following of farmers to support them with both arms and supplies. This was one component of any farmer's household fund, his “rent” so to speak, his expenditures for travel and support for his chieftain, without which his chieftain or another would take his land and livestock. In addition, expeditions took labor from the farm and put the farmer's life at risk. Even so, a farmer's claims to land were not secure, since his chieftain might abandon him, another more powerful chieftain might claim his land, or simply take it, or a farmer might lose his land in a re-alignment of alliances among chieftains, which were frequent.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_IsCommw] The interests of chieftains and farmers were often in conflict: 'There was a basic conflict between chieftains' increasing demands for demonstrations of force in support of claims to ownership and the subsistence demands, the economic roles, of farmers.

We cannot rule out the possibility that these were sometimes employed in farmwork but their chief role was certainly military. These retainers were present after about 1200. The total number of professional warriors in Iceland - retainers in the service of lords and gentry - seems to have been at least 300 at the hight of the Sturlung wars (ca. 1235-1255) or about 0.5% of the population. These were the core of a warlord’s army and could be very instrumental in the outcome of battles (eg. Haugsnes 1246).'

Even after 1056 CE, they often doubled as church owners and some of them became priests. But many Christian priests were full-time, all of them had some training and most or all of them were paid or had a secure income from their own or ecclesiastical estates.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_92_IsCommw] Christianity was introduced in 1000ce: 'Iceland was settled before any significant impact of Christianity in Scandinavia and the early Icelanders were pagans. Many of the Celtic people incorporated in the foundational population were probably Christian but this appears to have had little impact in the society in general. Pre-Christian religious practices are known largely by poetic and literary sources, all recorded during the Christian era, and some traces of material culture. These sources depict a rich cosmology including the Norse pantheon of gods and giants. Thor held a place of special significance based on his frequent inclusion in person and place names. The Icelanders inhabited an environment rich in supernatural entities including trolls, elves, and ghosts. Prescience and magical abilities were often attributed to individuals. In 1000 A.D., responding to a combination of internal and foreign pressure exerted by the Norwegian king, the Icelanders meeting at the General Assembly decided to adopt Christianity as the common religion. Hencefor th Iceland was officially Christian although many of the traditional beliefs remained.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_93_IsCommw] 'By the end of the 10th century, the Norwegians were forced by their king, Olaf I Tryggvason, to accept Christianity. The king also sent missionaries to Iceland who, according to 12th-century sources, were highly successful in converting the Icelanders. In 999 or 1000 the Althing made a peaceful decision that all Icelanders should become Christians. In spite of this decision, the godar retained their political role, and many of them probably built their own churches. Some were ordained, and as a group they seem to have closely controlled the organization of the new religion. Two bishoprics were established, one at Skálholt in 1056 and the other at Hólar in 1106. Literate Christian culture also transformed lay life. Codification of the law was begun in 1117-18. Later the Icelanders began to write sagas, which were to reach their pinnacle of literary achievement in the next century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_94_IsCommw] During the pagan period, chiefs frequently fulfilled religious functions: 'Pagan ceremonies were varied, and the details handed down by later Christian texts are not clear. Sacrificial rites performed by household heads or chieftains played a part in the ritual. Certain rituals seeking the intercession of spirits for divination or assistance (SEIÐR) were largely performed by women. Special cultic sites or buildings (HOFS) existed but religious ceremonies were not limited to these settings. Sacrificial activities were banned shortly after the conversion and Christian ceremonies such as baptism and communion were introduced.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_95_IsCommw] The offices of priest and bishop were introduced after the formal adoption of Christianity, but chiefs and farmers remained primary actors in the performance of rituals: 'The political institution of chieftaincy (GOÐORÐ) was rooted in religious function, a priestly office of intermediary between the community and supernatural forces. It is unclear the degree to which the role of chieftains had been secularized by the occupation of Iceland, but it is likely chiefs played a continued role in local religious activities by performing rites and sacrifices. Religious activities were not exclusive to chieftains. Individuals played a variety of intermediary between the mundane and supernatural roles including private devotions, divination, and sorcery. The conversion to Christianity brought with it the institutions of priest and bishop to Iceland. Throughout much of the early period, the institutional power of the church was weak. Churches were located on privately owned farmlands and were built and maintained by the local farmers who maintained a priest or served as priest himself. The early farm churches were small and probably served little more than the household and immediate neighbors.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_96_IsCommw] The few Icelandic bishops of the Commonwealth period resembled chiefs in their reliance on additional household labour: 'Although I would prefer to flout the conventional wisdom that slavery had all but died out by the eleventh century (Karras 1988a), the household laborers that replaced them in the Commonwealth period were numerous. When Þórðr kakali returns to Iceland Kolbeinn ungi immediately sends out thirty húsmenn to look for him in Eyjafjörðr. Þorsteinn Cod-biter had sixty free men in his household (Eyrbyggja saga, ÍF 4, ch. 11); Guðmundr the Mighty had one hundred (Brennu-Njáls saga, ÍF 12, ch. 113); Sörla þáttr (Ljósvetninga saga), ÍF 10, ch. 1:109); Bishop Páll's household at Skálholt (ca 1200) had seventy to eighty residents, and a household with eighty has been discussed above. It is probably not unfair to say that by the Commonwealth period the majority of the wealth of great bœndur and goðar was the product of teams of house-men and women.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_97_IsCommw] The interests of the church and the 'secular' elites were in conflict during the phase of intensified internal strife that preceded the Norwegian period: 'As I have mentioned earlier, the era of the Sturlungs was a period bordering on civil war, in which the Sturlunga family was central. What kinds of sentiments would the author of the Eyrbyggja saga, who must have been close to the Sturlungs, be likely to express? Although some of the Sturlung family's most prominent members in Norway had solemnly obliged themselves to further the king's cause, they nevertheless tended to forget the vow when they returned to Iceland. As also was the case with other chieftains, they preferred to act independently of the king. Some of the Sturlungs clearly harbored dreams of being Icelandic kings; others preferred a society governed by an oligarchy of Icelandic [Page 144] chieftains. In both cases sentiments would have been against the Norwegian king's growing influence in Iceland. The Sturlungs were therefore likely to express anti-royal feelings, even though they might admire the king's person. As the aristocracy was competing with the Church, we may also assume that the Sturlungs were against the ascending dominance of the Church in juridical, economic, and moral matters (Hastrup 1985, ch. 7). Two of the Sturlungs had in fact been instrumental in removing bishop Ari Guðmundsson from his bishopric in northern Iceland in 1222 (ST 1:287-298). As representatives of the dominant class, the Sturlungs were also likely to express contempt towards the lower classes. We find all these structurally determined resentments in Eyrbyggja saga.'

Grágás has been preserved in two manuscripts which date to about 1260 and 1280. It is not possible to assign dates to individual provisions within it. The provenance of the manuscripts is unknown and neither is an official compilation (Miller 1990: 42).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_109_IsCommw] 'Another section of Grágás, Vígslóði (“Consequences of Slaying”), says that compensations for slaying suits belong to heirs, men or women, and gives the order in which relatives should become plaintiffs. The saga evidence does not contradict this section of the law, to which the Baugatal is only an appendix (Phillpotts 1913&nbsp;: 38).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_110_IsCommw] 'One reading of the parts of Grágás that specify wergild divisions, Baugatal, suggests that Iceland was “almost a federation of kindreds” (Phillpotts 1913&nbsp;: 11). Phillpotts reviews the law and says that “if we compare these regulations with Saga wergilds the result is somewhat baffling” (1913&nbsp;: 13). In the whole corpus of sagas never is a wergild reduced to compensate for missing kinsmen in various categories. It is always a fixed sum. The wergild is never divided among classes of kindred as the law stipulates. There are no disputes about wergild shares among payers or receivers. In Iceland kinsmen quarreled about everything else, and elsewhere in northern Europe kinsmen disputed about the division of wergilds. Often a person who should receive payment of wergild as a relative of a slain person was fighting on the side of his killer (pp. 13-14).'

The legislature, extensive law code, and judicial system of local and higher courts left prosecution and the enforcement of settlements in the hands of individuals. From an early date, the country was divided into Quarters. Each quarter constituted a broad community with three assemblies (ÞINGS), with the exception of the Northern Quarter that had four, and a system of local courts. Once a year the General Assembly (ALÞINGI) met in the southwest of Iceland. Judicial cases that could not be resolved in local quarters were heard and the parliament (LÖGRÉTTA) convened. The parliament was the principal legislative institution and was responsible for the introduction and maintanence of law. It consisted of chieftains (GOÐAR) from the local quarters. After the conversion to Christianity, the two Icelandic bishops were each given a seat in the parliament. The institution of chieftaincy (GOÐORÐ) was the main locus of political leadership in the country. Originally there were 36 but this number was later expanded. Chieftaincies themselves were a form of property and could be alienated and even divided among multiple individuals. In some cases, individuals asserted power beyond the scope of the political system and controlled multiple chieftaincies. All independent farmers had to be affiliated with a chieftain, although they could choose among any of the chieftains in their quarter and could switch allegiances if they did not feel that their needs were being met. Other than a seat on the parliament, chieftains had few rights beyond those of other independent farmers and few institutional means of dominating others. Chieftains derived much of their authority from their ability to broker support as advocates for their constituents in legal disputes or feuds.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_117_IsCommw] Entitlement to personal property was equally defended by force: 'In Commonwealth Iceland there was a system of extraction based on claims to ownership of property, on concepts of the unproblematic [Page 161] differential access to resources in favour of a chieftainly class. The chieftains were unwilling to subordinate themselves to state institutions to protect their privileged positions. The consequence was stratification without a state, the contradiction of an economic system based on property relationships without a congruent institutional system to enforce them. Ownership was as sound as the force one could muster to defend it. There was a complex system of law, but it was all just so much labyrinthine rhetoric in the face of the stark reality that power decided.

Banishment from the community or exile from the country became a dead letter of law, as in the Jónsbók of 1281 (1970), even though magicians would occasionally be banished as late as the seventeenth century (Reykers 1936:16). And as a fugitive from justice rather than the outcast of the community, the postmedieval Icelandic outlaw was no longer punishable by the people he had wronged but instead by state-appointed magistrates and the public executioner.

Everyone was legally required to belong to a farming household and individual farmers had authority over and responsibility for their households. Disputes, including injuries and killings, were settled through arbitration. The offending party paid compensation to the offended party. In more extreme cases the offending individual was outlawed, either for three years or permanently, and was official cast out of society and any right to compensation. Prosecution and collection of settlements was up to private individuals. Conflicts often overstepped institutional boundaries into blood feuds. Feuds could escalate well beyond the immediate individuals or households until the involved whole social networks. With the rise of chiefly power and territoriality in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries regional conflicts developed that eventually encompassed t he entire island. The decades of civil strife ended in 1262 A.D. when Iceland came under the authority of the Norwegian crown.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_132_IsCommw] Icelanders maintained trading relations with Scandinavians and Europeans: 'The early Icelanders maintained commercial contacts with Europe and obtained goods from Scandinavia, England, the Norse Orkneys, and the Netherlands. The majority of trade, however, was with Norway, both for Norwegian goods and for foreign goods obtained by Norwegian merchants. The limited resources, especially in terms of raw materials for manufactured goods, made Iceland highly dependent on imported goods. Even before the decline and cessation of grain production in Iceland it is unlikely that Iceland ever produced enough cereals to meet its own needs. Of special significance in a feasting economy, grain and malt were essential to ale production. After Christianization imported wine also become essential for the celebration of communion. Many higher quality iron products, for example weapons and armor, could not be produced from local sources and were imported, mostly in finished forms. Other metals - brass, tin, lead, gold, silver, and bronze - were unavailable locally as well as steatite for utensils and stone suitable for making whetstones. Iceland had a limited number of exportable resources and goods. Homespun woolen cloth was the principal export and was a common standard of value in local exchanges. Sulfur, unavailable from any continental source, was a valuable commodity. Falcons and various animal skins - sheep, fox, and cat - were marketable as were cheese and possibly butter. Fish, the current mainstay of the Icelandic economy was not a significant export item in early Iceland.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_133_IsCommw] According to Bolender, there were no formal markets: 'There were no formal markets and most exchanges and payments, such as rents, were made in kind. Regular assemblies provided a venue for traders and specialized producers who also traveled among farmsteads.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_148_IsCommw] According to Hálfdanarson, roads were absent from Commonwealth-Era Iceland: 'The history of Iceland reflects its harsh ecological conditions in various ways. Although the country is not well suited for agriculture because the short summers render commercial grain growing almost impossible, animal husbandry remained the main occupation of its population for the first millennium of its history. Sheep and cattle were the most important domestic animals; the former raised for their milk, wool, and meat, and the latter primarily for their milk. Horses were used for transportation, but a total absence of roads made the use of wagons or other vehicles almost impossible in Iceland. Icelandic farming took the form of sedentary pastoralism, meaning that extensive mountain pastures were crucial for the feeding of the animals during the summer, while during the winter, farmers and peasants grazed their animals close to their farms and used hay from meadows as fodder for their livestock. In congruence with these economic patterns, the rural population in Iceland was dispersed over the whole inhabitable area. Each farm needed a relatively large tract of land to be economically viable, a fact that made concentration into peasant villages impractical. Rather, the whole countryside was divided between separate farming households living on individual farms. The only common lands were the mountain pastures, which were usually separated from the inhabited lowland.'

When told that during the Middle Ages there flourished in Iceland a dynamic civilization they are surprised and ask for archaeological evidence (cf. Ingimundarson, this volume). There is very little to show. The volcanic soil of Iceland is acid and buried artifacts soon disintegrate. Moreover, Icelanders of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries built of wood and earth and not of stone. That is why there is so little left of the material civilization of the Icelandic Commonwealth, just a few objects such as the stone sarcophagus of Bishop Páll Jónsson, who died in 1211, or the boards from Flatatunga which are the remains of a great Doomsday fresco which adorned the twelfth-century cathedral at the episcopal see of Hólar in northern Iceland (see Ágústsson 1989).

The majority of trade, however, was with Norway, both for Norwegian goods and for foreign goods obtained by Norwegian merchants. The limited resources, especially in terms of raw materials for manufactured goods, made Iceland highly dependent on imported goods. Even before the decline and cessation of grain production in Iceland it is unlikely that Iceland ever produced enough cereals to meet its own needs. Of special significance in a feasting economy, grain and malt were essential to ale production. After Christianization imported wine also become essential for the celebration of communion. Many higher quality iron products, for example weapons and armor, could not be produced from local sources and were imported, mostly in finished forms. Other metals - brass, tin, lead, gold, silver, and bronze - were unavailable locally as well as steatite for utensils and stone suitable for making whetstones. Iceland had a limited number of exportable resources and goods. Homespun woolen cloth was the principal export and was a common standard of value in local exchanges. Sulfur, unavailable from any continental source, was a valuable commodity. Falcons and various animal skins - sheep, fox, and cat - were marketable as were cheese and possibly butter. Fish, the current mainstay of the Icelandic economy was not a significant export item in early Iceland.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_164_IsCommw] According to Bolender, there were no formal markets: 'There were no formal markets and most exchanges and payments, such as rents, were made in kind. Regular assemblies provided a venue for traders and specialized producers who also traveled among farmsteads. Despite the rarity of monetary exchanges, the Icelanders maintained a complex system of value equivalencies based on a silver ounce standard that encompassed most exchangeable goods.'

Accurate data on the number, distribution, sizes, and type of outbuildings on each farm located within a region by archaeological survey and estimates of the number of livestock sheltered in traditional Icelandic outbuildings should allow assessments of the number of livestock maintained by the farms identified in surveys and of their economic rank within the district. To accomplish this end, however, ethnoarchaeological research must be undertaken on standing examples of traditional architecture to document relationships that exist between the size and type of structures and the number and kind of livestock that they held. Furthermore, all ruins within farm complexes must be accurately dated to particular periods on a regional basis. With such data, changes through time in the size and organization of farms could be translated not only into inferences about changing regional economic strategies but also into statements about changing patterns of regional economic and political organization.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_168_IsCommw] 'The requirements of livestock herding insured that Icelandic land-use was characterized by low population densities, a dispersed settlement pattern, and large farmsteads. Within such farmsteads land was divided into spatial units reflecting different levels of management associated with homefields, hay-producing areas, and outer pastures. Outbuildings associated with the seasonal components of Icelandic transhumant pastoralism were scattered throughout these various land-use areas and in the upland heaths surrounding zones of intensive occupation (Bredahl-Petersen 1967; Hastrup 1985).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_169_IsCommw]  However, there were also communal pens and enclosures: 'There were numerous animal pens for communal purposes in later times although we are unsure how old these were. Some probably existed in the Commonwealth period. There also were very substantial earthworks that, at least partly, served a communal purpose in keeping livestock in designated grazing areas. The earthworks date to the Commonwealth period. There were also at least two forts without permanent habitation (Dalavirki and Borgarvirki). None of these were ‘state-owned’, but they served the community and can be considered public works as farmers were obliged by law to build them.

Clays suitable for ceramic production are largely unavailable in Iceland. Woodworking and carpentry were essential to construction and the many household items were fashioned from driftwood. Bog iron was used for most metalworking and required charcoal production for smelting and working. Spinning and weaving from wool was a ubiquitous household industry. Leather was another important material in the production of clothing and household goods. Ale was locally produced, largely from imported grains and salt was made from burning kelp and seaweed.'

Fishing was carried out from coastal farms, and also from seasonal fishing stations when fish, especially cod, came ashore. Cereal crops were grown in Iceland in the Middle Ages, mainly in the south, but animal husbandry (cattle and sheep) was the mainstay. Both provided meat, and milk for cheese and skyr (milk curd), and the sheep's wool was woven into cloth which was Iceland's principal export commodity until the 14th century [...]. The Icelandic way of life is well illustrated by the units of value used: alin vadmáls (an ell, about 50cm, of woollen cloth), kúgildi (the value of a cow), equivalent to 120 ells, and subsequently fiskur (fish), equivalent to half an ell.'

In 999 or 1000 the Althing made a peaceful decision that all Icelanders should become Christians. In spite of this decision, the godar retained their political role, and many of them probably built their own churches. Some were ordained, and as a group they seem to have closely controlled the organization of the new religion. Two bishoprics were established, one at Skálholt in 1056 and the other at Hólar in 1106. Literate Christian culture also transformed lay life. Codification of the law was begun in 1117-18. Later the Icelanders began to write sagas, which were to reach their pinnacle of literary achievement in the next century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_178_IsCommw] Icelandic historiography indicates a clear sense of past events and chronology: 'One of the remarkable legacies of early Iceland is its wealth of literary production. Icelandic literary production encompassed continental chivalrous, hagiographic, and historical traditions, in addition to the autochthonous development of the saga. Among other topics, Icelandic sagas depict events from the early years of Icelandic society, the colonization of Greenland and the discovery of North America, and the civil wars that characterized the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in Iceland.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_182_IsCommw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ present ♥</b> Odner refers to oral literature: 'While literacy became widespread in Iceland during the two centuries prior to the writing of the sagas, the evidence suggests that writing continued to be connected to chieftains and landowners. As literacy was taught by the Church, most chieftains had clerical training, and many of them were ordained priests (Sveinsson 1953). Although the international outlook of Christianity was inimical to the kin-based and locally-based Icelandic civilization, at that time it was probably not regarded as too radical. Actually, when Christianity was first introduced to Iceland, it was probably considered to be a resource which the chieftains could exploit [Page 127] to their own benefit, and literacy was part of it. At the turn of the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries, when they began to write sagas, relations between the lay and Church authorities became strained. The literature of the twelfth century is half-secular, half-ecclesiastic (Sveinsson 1953:103). The tension between the Church and the chieftains created an independent secular literature in Iceland in the thirteenth century (Lönnroth 1991). Increasingly, people turned to the oral literature which existed in the secular social environment. The context of literacy continued to be closely associated to the dominant social class.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_183_IsCommw] Later written records, such as sagas, at least in part reflected older oral traditions (see below). The legal code was initially transmitted orally (see above): 'As Hastrup points out (1985:189) the principal of allodial or adal land, family ownership of land, was not transplanted to Iceland, for one reason, because there was no history of prior occupation on which to base such claims. She agrees with those who argue that the reason for the writing of Landnámabók, the Book of Settlements, which lists many settlers, their land claims, genealogies, and events of the Settlement Period, in the twelfth century was to provide evidence for claims to hereditary rights in land (p. 192). This work was written some time after the first recording of law began in 1117. The collection of laws is known as Grágás. According to this code, [Page 246] written nearly two-hundred years after the establishment of the Alþing and the adoption of an oral code of laws, land ownership was individual (Hastrup 1985:189). Hastrup argues that there was a contradiction between the legal code of individual ownership and informal concepts of family ownership which developed during the period after the settlement.'

Actually, literacy was introduced with the runic alphabet as early as the second or third century A.D. Literacy seems, however, to have been the prerogative of the aristocratic class. It seems that the secrets were jealously guarded by the leading social stratum. Runic inscriptions are generally short, and mainly commemorate family relationships. The Tune stone runic inscription from Østfold in eastern Norway (from around A.D. 200) may serve as an example. Although there is some disagreement regarding interpretation, it is commonly believed that the inscription relates a number of inheritors to an ancestor (Grønvik 1981), and that it was connected to the inheritors' claims to exclusive rights to property. Runes were shrouded in magic and sorcery, imbuing the text with sacrality. Writing constituted authority. That writing of runes was associated with people of authority is also manifested in Norse mythology. In the poem Rígsþula, written in Iceland in the thirteenth century, but commonly [Page 126] believed to belong to the Viking period, the god Heimdallr teaches the prince Jarl (Earl) to write runes. In some of the stanzas of Hávamál the high god Óðinn sacrifices himself in order to obtain the powerful knowledge of the runes (138-141). Óðinn was above all the god of the aristocratic warriors. In these and similar cases the basic message is that rune writing was an exclusive right of the aristocratic class.'

By the beginning of the twelfth century linguistic conservatism on the remote island society had introduced significant differences between Icelandic and its Scandinavian neighbors resulting in a distinct Icelandic. Prior to the conversion to Christianity in 1000 A.D., Old Norse was written in a runic alphabet. Runes had a restricted use and few runic inscriptions have survived from Iceland.

Although there is some disagreement regarding interpretation, it is commonly believed that the inscription relates a number of inheritors to an ancestor (Grønvik 1981), and that it was connected to the inheritors' claims to exclusive rights to property. Runes were shrouded in magic and sorcery, imbuing the text with sacrality. Writing constituted authority. That writing of runes was associated with people of authority is also manifested in Norse mythology. In the poem Rígsþula, written in Iceland in the thirteenth century, but commonly [Page 126] believed to belong to the Viking period, the god Heimdallr teaches the prince Jarl (Earl) to write runes. In some of the stanzas of Hávamál the high god Óðinn sacrifices himself in order to obtain the powerful knowledge of the runes (138-141). Óðinn was above all the god of the aristocratic warriors. In these and similar cases the basic message is that rune writing was an exclusive right of the aristocratic class.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_198_IsCommw] The introduction of the Latin alphabet expanded the spectrum of written genres beyond the badly preserved runic tradition: 'At the time of settlement, the Icelanders spoke Old Norse (a Germanic language, in the large Indo-European group of languages), which was then common throughout Scandinavia. By the beginning of the twelfth century linguistic conservatism on the remote island society had introduced significant differences between Icelandic and its Scandinavian neighbors resulting in a distinct Icelandic. Prior to the conversion to Christianity in 1000 A.D., Old Norse was written in a runic alphabet. Runes had a restricted use and few runic inscriptions have survived from Iceland. With Christianity came the Roman alphabet and the expansion of written genres, which thrived in Iceland.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_199_IsCommw] Early Icelanders then developed a rich literary tradition: 'One of the remarkable legacies of early Iceland is its wealth of literary production. Icelandic literary production encompassed continental chivalrous, hagiographic, and historical traditions, in addition to the autochthonous development of the saga. Among other topics, Icelandic sagas depict events from the early years of Icelandic society, the colonization of Greenland and the discovery of North America, and the civil wars that characterized the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in Iceland. The medieval manuscripts also preserve an artistic tradition in illumination. The literary levels achieved in Iceland, to some degree, developed from strong oral traditions of poetry and narrative. Much of the material culture of early Iceland has not been preserved but a strong tradition in artistic woodcarving is evident.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_200_IsCommw] The introduction of Christianity was an important factor in this process: 'By the end of the 10th century, the Norwegians were forced by their king, Olaf I Tryggvason, to accept Christianity. The king also sent missionaries to Iceland who, according to 12th-century sources, were highly successful in converting the Icelanders. In 999 or 1000 the Althing made a peaceful decision that all Icelanders should become Christians. In spite of this decision, the godar retained their political role, and many of them probably built their own churches. Some were ordained, and as a group they seem to have closely controlled the organization of the new religion. Two bishoprics were established, one at Skálholt in 1056 and the other at Hólar in 1106. Literate Christian culture also transformed lay life. Codification of the law was begun in 1117-18. Later the Icelanders began to write sagas, which were to reach their pinnacle of literary achievement in the next century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_201_IsCommw] 'While literacy became widespread in Iceland during the two centuries prior to the writing of the sagas, the evidence suggests that writing continued to be connected to chieftains and landowners. As literacy was taught by the Church, most chieftains had clerical training, and many of them were ordained priests (Sveinsson 1953). Although the international outlook of Christianity was inimical to the kin-based and locally-based Icelandic civilization, at that time it was probably not regarded as too radical. Actually, when Christianity was first introduced to Iceland, it was probably considered to be a resource which the chieftains could exploit [Page 127] to their own benefit, and literacy was part of it. At the turn of the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries, when they began to write sagas, relations between the lay and Church authorities became strained. The literature of the twelfth century is half-secular, half-ecclesiastic (Sveinsson 1953:103). The tension between the Church and the chieftains created an independent secular literature in Iceland in the thirteenth century (Lönnroth 1991). Increasingly, people turned to the oral literature which existed in the secular social environment. The context of literacy continued to be closely associated to the dominant social class.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_202_IsCommw] The Roman alphabet was adapted to the Norse vernacular: 'When they started writing, Icelanders wrote about secular as well as religious matters. They adapted the Roman alphabet to their own tongue and wrote in the vernacular because they had something to write for one another. This process of writing started just about a hundred years after seasonal labor became available, when landowners could expand their holdings and the distribution of wealth, land, and power began to shift in a continuous process of revaluing the social and political variables.'

She agrees with those who argue that the reason for the writing of Landnámabók, the Book of Settlements, which lists many settlers, their land claims, genealogies, and events of the Settlement Period, in the twelfth century was to provide evidence for claims to hereditary rights in land (p. 192). This work was written some time after the first recording of law began in 1117. The collection of laws is known as Grágás. According to this code, [Page 246] written nearly two-hundred years after the establishment of the Alþing and the adoption of an oral code of laws, land ownership was individual (Hastrup 1985:189).

Originally this was a special standardized cloth but later on (after the end of the Commonwealth) this cloth became obsolete but the unit was still used as a standard unit of value although it no longer referred to a real commodity. These ells (álnir) were the most used units of value in Iceland and formed the basis of the land value system that was probably introduced around 1100 (with the introduction of tithe).

The majority of trade, however, was with Norway, both for Norwegian goods and for foreign goods obtained by Norwegian merchants. The limited resources, especially in terms of raw materials for manufactured goods, made Iceland highly dependent on imported goods. Even before the decline and cessation of grain production in Iceland it is unlikely that Iceland ever produced enough cereals to meet its own needs. Of special significance in a feasting economy, grain and malt were essential to ale production. After Christianization imported wine also become essential for the celebration of communion. Many higher quality iron products, for example weapons and armor, could not be produced from local sources and were imported, mostly in finished forms. Other metals - brass, tin, lead, gold, silver, and bronze - were unavailable locally as well as steatite for utensils and stone suitable for making whetstones. Iceland had a limited number of exportable resources and goods. Homespun woolen cloth was the principal export and was a common standard of value in local exchanges. Sulfur, unavailable from any continental source, was a valuable commodity. Falcons and various animal skins - sheep, fox, and cat - were marketable as were cheese and possibly butter.

The commune was a territorial unit including many households (20 or more). The commune's main functions were management of summer grazing lands, the cooperative round up of animals in the fall, and care for paupers who had no other household support. They also provided some insurance to households against fire or the loss of livestock.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_239_IsCommw] 'Sections in the Old Law Code that refer to division of the entire country into numerous municipalities (hreppar) reveal the operation of insurance systems. The often celebrated autonomy of these municipal administrations, as independent of the authority of chieftaincies (see Benediktsson 1974:185-186; Stein-Wilkeshuis 1982:347), must be seen in light of a class-, community-, and state-formation, variable at different historical moments. Documented functions of these communal units, aside from their origins as ‘free-associations’, were to compensate farmers for [Page 225] the loss of cattle and housing (but not for the loss of sheep) and to provide tithe relief for the poor, while relatives were also required to provide proscribed assistance to their poorer kin. The disjuncture of responsibility or solidarity which separated chiefdoms and municipalities indicates to me that chieftains were not primary agents of redistribution as much as it underscores merchant-farmers' interests. During the heyday of Icelandic trade enterprise these municipalities, as well as the kin-based support system, helped neighboring household units collectively to ensure each other's reproduction in face of severe subsistence risks without cost to wealthy farmers; maintained semi-proletarianized labor-power through winters; supported these merchant-farmers from whom communal funds purchased replacement cattle; and preserved the incentives for wool products in sheep rearing among commoners. With respect to the last item mentioned, the fact that bad years would kill livestock constituted a constant risk. By killing the cows, in particular, there would be a tendency for relying on sheep as the primary means of livelihood.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_241_IsCommw] Assemblies were aware of and attempted to influence established rates of exchange: 'About 1186 a local assembly in the South, Árnes, devalued the standard rate of exchange of woolen cloth by 35%, which increased the relative values of other goods.

It raised the value of cloth by 6%, to lower other prices. Gelsinger (1981:174-5) concludes that, “by instituting controls that were not enforceable and that would have been further injurious to trade had they been, the Althing encouraged lawlessness both among Icelanders and foreign merchants.” This was clearly an attempt to increase the productivity of land owning households by increasing the return of foreign products per unit of [Page 254] wool produced by Icelandic labor in the control of landowners.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_242_IsCommw] Ingimundarson refers to credit and loan arrangements and the accumulation of goods: 'The family sagas amply describe exchanges and accumulation of resources, goods and services that took place by socio-political and kinordered means (see recent discussions by Byock 1988:77-102; Durrenberger 1990, 1992). I agree that, as Durrenberger suggests (1990:89), the family sagas show considerable “self-conscious analysis of social conditions” without being “simply transpositions of contemporary events onto past locale and people.” However, I think that the sagas are conspicuously mute with respect to crucial economic activities that centered around domestic credit exchanges and foreign trade, and that economic-class analysis figures subliminally in the texts (cf. Samson, this volume). Rather than assume that the narratives are, when taken together, complete with certain elements that allow for a direct reading, I point out that, detrimental for the analyst, this literature is merely whispering on the combined subject of credit or loan markets and production for foreign exchange, not to mention municipal administration. I refer to Miller's discussion on this issue: "Between larger and smaller farms there must have existed a fairly permanent series of exchanges regularized in creditor-debtor or landlord-tenant relationships. The amount of attention Grágás gives to loans, especially of livestock, and the proper procedures for their repayment and the recovery of delinquent debts, suggests the frequency of these kinds of transactions and the likelihood that they were a frequent source of conflict as well….

The sagas, however, confirm the existence of internal trade and specialized employments, although we have little way of recovering the levels of activity or how regularized such mercantilelike exchanges were.

Tómasson (1977) agrees with G. Karlsson (1977) that this saga is about a power struggle between the old order of chieftains (goðar) and the newly rich aristocrats (höfðingjar) whose economic foundation was the wealth of the church farms and tithe taxes. As Tómasson (1977:110) puts it, “in Bandamanna saga it is simply shown that a fat money-bag may break all bonds.” The humor of our saga points to the difference of orientation between those who gain wealth in order to disperse it socially and those who gain it for private or anti-social use.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_244_IsCommw] There were no banks or comparable institutions, but trade documents were present: 'There were no banks but people freely borrowed and lent each other money. Trade with merchants (often foreigners) often involved lending and borrowing. Examples should be easily found in the sagas.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_245_IsCommw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Store of wealth ♣ present ♥</b> Local associations of farmers provided 'insurance' against fire and loss of livestock: 'The main cooperative unit outside of the household was the commune (HREPPUR). The commune was a territorial unit including many households (20 or more). The commune's main functions were management of summer grazing lands, the cooperative round up of animals in the fall, and care for paupers who had no other household support. They also provided some insurance to households against fire or the loss of livestock.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_IsCommw] 'Sections in the Old Law Code that refer to division of the entire country into numerous municipalities (hreppar) reveal the operation of insurance systems. The often celebrated autonomy of these municipal administrations, as independent of the authority of chieftaincies (see Benediktsson 1974:185-186; Stein-Wilkeshuis 1982:347), must be seen in light of a class-, community-, and state-formation, variable at different historical moments. Documented functions of these communal units, aside from their origins as ‘free-associations’, were to compensate farmers for [Page 225] the loss of cattle and housing (but not for the loss of sheep) and to provide tithe relief for the poor, while relatives were also required to provide proscribed assistance to their poorer kin. The disjuncture of responsibility or solidarity which separated chiefdoms and municipalities indicates to me that chieftains were not primary agents of redistribution as much as it underscores merchant-farmers' interests. During the heyday of Icelandic trade enterprise these municipalities, as well as the kin-based support system, helped neighboring household units collectively to ensure each other's reproduction in face of severe subsistence risks without cost to wealthy farmers; maintained semi-proletarianized labor-power through winters; supported these merchant-farmers from whom communal funds purchased replacement cattle; and preserved the incentives for wool products in sheep rearing among commoners.

He was able to secure fifteen small vessels, and sailed with a band of 220 men, leaving the defense of the home districts to Sturla Thordsson. But Kolbein, who was informed of his plans, met him with a larger fleet and superior forces in the bay of Hunafloi, and defeated him after a severe engagement.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_273_IsCommw] [None of these ships/boats appear to have been ocean going merchant vessels.

Both Óspakr and Hörðr had such fortifications built for themselves, their wives and families, and their men, Hörðr's island retreat of wood and turf being virtually impregnable. Though Óspakr's earthworks enclosed a farm with two cows, where his wife and son lived, these fortifications were not internally self-sustaining but were chiefly designed for receiving stolen goods, viz., the produce of the surrounding countryside, and for staging last-ditch defenses. It is remarkable but not unintelligible that the sizeable outlaw colony on the tiny island of Geirshólmr, under the leadership of Hörðr Grímkelsson and his foster-brother Geirr Grímsson, seems never to have engaged in animal husbandry of any sort on the island, or gone fishing in the surrounding waters, but instead preferred to launch expedition after expedition to the mainland in order to rustle from the rich coastal farms the cattle and sheep that it lacked; these would be slaughtered at once for its consumption. One may well think that cattle- and sheep-rustling was a perfectly suitable occupation for outlaws, but they were undercutting themselves by their total dependence on the mainland, and finally allowed themselves to be lured to shore by promises of freedom and were put to death in batches by a coalition of farmers who were lying in wait to dispatch them. So, at any rate, the story of the ‘Hólmverjar’ goes in Harðar saga Grímkelssonar (chs 34ff.). The colony was eradicated in three years' time without the mainland farmers' even having to assault the impregnable hall of Hörðr on one cliffside of the island.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_274_IsCommw] But it seems likely that the location of manors attached to powerful chieftains and their retainers was chosen with potential attacks in mind.

During this period the bloody feuds subsided, churches and schools wer built, and and an intellectual life blossomed forth which elevated Iceland to the position of literary leadership in the North.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_279_IsCommw] Over time, the godords became concentrated in the hands of a few chieftains who controlled groups of armed followers: 'As armed conflict was still the final argument in so many controversies, the godar were naturally eager to gain possession of new godords whenever possible, in order to increase the number of their thingmenn. How this method was used to satisfy personal ambition at the expense of the existing state organization is clearly seen in the case of the Sturlungs in western Iceland, who rose in this way to the greatest power, though at first they probably did not even possess a godord. The real prominence of this family began with Sturla Thordsson, or Hvamm-Sturla, so called from the estate Hvamm which he had purchased.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_280_IsCommw] This period saw an intensification of civil strife, mostly in the form of clashes between groups of retainers led by these 'magnates': 'Unlike a modern member of parliament, a chieftain could gain control of more than one godord. In the latter half of the 12th century, there was a growing tendency for more than one godord to belong to the same man. The sagas sometimes mention a godord being given to a man who already had one. Some people who inherited a godord appear not to have wanted it [...], while some proved incapable of providing their liegemen with the protection expected of them. This trend continued, until early in the 13th century the majority of the country had become concentrated in the hands of eight magnates. In addition, some of these were close relatives, so that five families or clans practically ruled the country. At about the same time, conflict intensified. There were more battles, with more numerous forces, and they travelled longer distances to make war. This may have been partly a consequence of the concentration of power: the magnates could raise larger forces of farmers from among their followers, and they had to travel farther to the next magnate's territory. Another contributory factor may have been the influence of the king of Norway. At this time, royal power was in the ascendant in Norway after a prolonged period of discord and civil war. In 1217 King Hakon Hakonson succeeded to the throne; he would reign, largely in peace, until 1263. The king appears to have resolved to gain control of all lands around the North Atlantic inhabited by Norse people. This period of internal strife between magnates, and royal attempts to take control of Iceland, is known in Iceland as the Sturlung Age, in reference to one of the magnate clans. The precise dating of the Sturlung Age varies, but it is logical to date it from when the sources first mention plans by the Norwegian crown to take over Iceland, i.e. 1220. This was when an Icelandic chieftain of the Sturlung clan, Snorri Sturluson, left Norway for Iceand, having undertaken to win Iceland over to the king. Snorri, admittedly, never fulfilled this promise, and one source states that he did not try very hard. But 15 years later another member of the Sturlungs undertook the same task.

Another contributory factor may have been the influence of the king of Norway. At this time, royal power was in the ascendant in Norway after a prolonged period of discord and civil war. In 1217 King Hakon Hakonson succeeded to the throne; he would reign, largely in peace, until 1263. The king appears to have resolved to gain control of all lands around the North Atlantic inhabited by Norse people. This period of internal strife between magnates, and royal attempts to take control of Iceland, is known in Iceland as the Sturlung Age, in reference to one of the magnate clans. The precise dating of the Sturlung Age varies, but it is logical to date it from when the sources first mention plans by the Norwegian crown to take over Iceland, i.e. 1220. This was when an Icelandic chieftain of the Sturlung clan, Snorri Sturluson, left Norway for Iceand, having undertaken to win Iceland over to the king. Snorri, admittedly, never fulfilled this promise, and one source states that he did not try very hard. But 15 years later another member of the Sturlungs undertook the same task. This was Snorri's nephew, Sturla Sighvatsson. Sturla launched a campaign of attacks on other magnates, aiming to induce them to flee to Norway, where the king would force them to abdicate their powers. But Sturla's campaign came to an end at the Battle of Örlygsstadir in north Iceland, on 21 August 1238. Sturla and his father, Sighvatur, led a force of several hundred, perhaps as many as 1,000, against nearly 1,700 men led by the magnate of the region, Kolbeinn Arnórsson the Young, and Gissur Porvaldsson from the south, a descendant of Gissur the White [...]. Both Sturla and Sighvatur died in battle, with about 50 of their supporters; their opponents only lost seven men. In the following years the conflict continued; among those who died was the chieftain and literary genius Snorri Sturluson, in 1241. In 1258 the king sent Gissur, the victor of Örlygsstadir, home to Iceland, with the tile of jalr (earl) of Iceland. He succeeded in inducing the chieftains and representatives of farmers in teh north, the west and south Iceland to swear allegiance to the king and undertake to pay him taxed in the future. In the next two years the same undertaking was given for the East Fjords and south-eastern Iceland.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_299_IsCommw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars involving groups with different dialects ♣ absent ♥</b> <i>There have never been significant dialectal differences in Iceland.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars involving groups with different languages ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars involving groups with different language families ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars between groups from different archaeological cultures ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars between different religious sects ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars between different world religions ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars of world religion against tribal religion ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars on Urbanism-Literacy frontier ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars on steppe frontier ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars on agricultural frontier ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Annexation ♣ inferred absent: 930-1150 CE; present: 1151-1262 CE ♥</b> All evidence stems from the late 12th century and especially the 13th century.

This transition was gradual and not clear-cut. Our codes reflect Christianity as well as some 'traditional' practices that were continued after the formal conversion of the Althing. More information on the process of religious transformation can be found in the relevant text passages below. The following general description was extracted from eHRAF: 'Iceland was settled before any significant impact of Christianity in Scandinavia and the early Icelanders were pagans. Many of the Celtic people incorporated in the foundational population were probably Christian but this appears to have had little impact in the society in general. Pre-Christian religious practices are known largely by poetic and literary sources, all recorded during the Christian era, and some traces of material culture. These sources depict a rich cosmology including the Norse pantheon of gods and giants. Thor held a place of special significance based on his frequent inclusion in person and place names. The Icelanders inhabited an environment rich in supernatural entities including trolls, elves, and ghosts. Prescience and magical abilities were often attributed to individuals. In 1000 A.D., responding to a combination of internal and foreign pressure exerted by the Norwegian king, the Icelanders meeting at the General Assembly decided to adopt Christianity as the common religion. Hencefor th Iceland was officially Christian although many of the traditional beliefs remained.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_343_IsCommw] 'The political institution of chieftaincy (GOÐORÐ) was rooted in religious function, a priestly office of intermediary between the community and supernatural forces. It is unclear the degree to which the role of chieftains had been secularized by the occupation of Iceland, but it is likely chiefs played a continued role in local religious activities by performing rites and sacrifices. Religious activities were not exclusive to chieftains. Individuals played a variety of intermediary between the mundane and supernatural roles including private devotions, divination, and sorcery. The conversion to Christianity brought with it the institutions of priest and bishop to Iceland. Throughout much of the early period, the institutional power of the church was weak. Churches were located on privately owned farmlands and were built and maintained by the local farmers who maintained a priest or served as priest himself. The early farm churches were small and probably served little more than the household and immediate neighbors.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_344_IsCommw] 'Pagan ceremonies were varied, and the details handed down by later Christian texts are not clear. Sacrificial rites performed by household heads or chieftains played a part in the ritual. Certain rituals seeking the intercession of spirits for divination or assistance (SEIÐR) were largely performed by women. Special cultic sites or buildings (HOFS) existed but religious ceremonies were not limited to these settings. Sacrificial activities were banned shortly after the conversion and Christian ceremonies such as baptism and communion were introduced.'

There was no equal access to basic resources (Fried 1967). About A.D. 930, the general assembly (Althing), the major institution of Commonwealth Iceland, was established. Each chieftain was obliged to attend its annual meetings. There was no “executive” agency to carry out decisions of the Althing. Most decisions hinged on the amount of force on each side rather than procedural nicety, innocence or guilt, or any concept of justice. The Althing was not primarily a legal institution but an arena for building coalitions, for making, breaking, and testing connections.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_346_IsCommw]//'Each chieftain had to attend the annual meetings and sit in the lögrétta with two advisors. Apparently few cases were brought to judicial conclusions. Most were arbitrated or settled by violence, if the evidence of the sagas is to be believed (Jones 1935:21). In cases that were adjudicated, plaintiffs had to enforce legal judgments by holding courts of execution at the farms of the defendants. These often led to violent clashes. The annual meetings at the General Assembly functioned more as an arena for building coalitions, for making, breaking, and testing connections than as a legal institution.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_347_IsCommw]//'There were probably thirty-six godar (sing. godi) or chieftains.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_348_IsCommw]//'According to the law book Grágás it was the duty of each farmer to serve as þingmaðr for one of the chieftains in the ‘quarter’ (fjórðungr) where he lived. If a farmer became dissatisfied with his chieftain, he was allowed once a year to change his choice. If the chieftain accepted the farmer as his þingmaðr, the farmer had to acknowledge his support for the chieftain in front of witnesses. But not all farmers were entitled to participation in the activities of the assembly, only farmers paying þingtax-þingfararkaupsbœndr. To achieve this status, one had to own a property of a certain size, related to the number of people living on the farm. The chieftain could chose one out of every nine of the þing-tax-paying farmers to follow him to the national Alþing at Þingvellir. Those not chosen to go had to pay an assembly-tax to the chieftain, who in turn paid the men who were to accompany him to Alþing. In return for their support, the chieftain was obliged to represent his þingmenn in all judicial matters. However, it must be admitted that the paragraphs in Grágás which mention the goði-þingmaðr relationship provide few details about what the various parties gained from it or how it was maintained, and basically they give the impression of a weak institution (GR 3: goðar, þingfararkaup, þingmaðr).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_349_IsCommw]//Gjerset provides a general description of the atmosphere at Althing meetings and the costs incurred by attending chieftains: 'At the opening of the session the thingstead was formally consecrated by the alsherjargodi, a descendant of the first settler, Ingolf Arnarson, who bore that title and had the right to perform this ceremony. From the highest elevation of the Mount of Laws the lögsögumadr would proclaim the laws and decrees. From the same place all announcements to the assembly were also made by persons who for this purpose were allowed to ascend the Mount of Laws. Below was the place of the lögrétta, which no one but the members was allowed to enter. Around the lögrétta and thingmenn a visiting public were assembled. On the plain between the Mount of Laws and the Almannagjá booths, or temporary dwellings, were erected for the members of the thing and those who attended its sessions. These booths were simple four-cornered structures with gabled walls without roofs. Before the opening of the session they were covered with a temporary roof of woollen cloth, the walls were draped with cloth, and the booth was divided into separate chambers for the thingmenn in the same manner. The godi had to attend the Althing unless lawfully prevented, in which case the other godar of his district chose an alternate. If a godi remained absent from the session of the Althing without due cause, he forfeited his godord, so also if he arrived at the thing later than the prescribed time, Thursday evening before sunset. A certain number of thingmenn from the godord had to accompany the godi to the Althing. At the meeting of the várthing he could choose one-sixth of their number either by oral agreement or by lot, but as many could go as wished to attend the thing. Those who were sent as representatives from the godord received board, lodging and free transportation to and from the thing. They were also exempt for the year from paying the thingfararkaup, a tax of ten alnar vadmál assessed by the godi on all the thingmenn who did not attend the Althing.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_350_IsCommw]//'He had to furnish the animals for the religious sacrifices, he was responsible for the upkeep of the temple, and during the sessions of the Althing he had to provide at his own expense free board and lodgings for his thingmenn at his own booths.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_351_IsCommw]//'The meeting of the Althing was the great event of the year, not only politically but also socially. All men of means and prominence would go to Thingvellir on that occasion, often accompanied by their wives and daughters, to meet friends and relatives from other settlements, to learn the news from abroad, listen to cases tried in the court, and to take part in the games and amusements. The young men from all parts of Iceland would naturally flock to so eventful a gathering to witness the thing proceedings and indulge in the national sports. Marriages were contracted, as seen from the "Njálssaga" [...]. Expeditions to foreign lands were arranged, and invitations were extended for great feasts at which the conviviality of Icelanders found its fullest expression.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_352_IsCommw]//The recitation of legal codes figured prominently in the proceedings: 'When the chieftains established the Alþing they also adopted a code of law. Lawspeakers were appointed for three-year terms. Their function was to recite the law orally, one-third at each meeting of the General Assembly, so that the full code would be recited within the term of each lawspeaker. The lawspeaker had the power to change the law, for if no one else reminded him of any item that he omitted to recite, it was dropped from the code.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_353_IsCommw]//'The highest official in the new general government was the lögsögumadr, who presided over the Althing, proclaimed the new laws and decisions from the Mount of Laws, and recited certain portions of the laws each year before the assembly. He was elected for the term of three years, but by repeated reelections was kept in office for so long a period that his tenure was often equivalent to a life incumbency.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_354_IsCommw]//'Lög enters many combinations. Lögrétta was the law council (Dennis et al. 1980) or court of legislation (Miller 1990). Rétta means to make right or straight, to stretch out or reach out, to make right or adjust. Literally, lögrétta means something like law righting or repairing. It was composed of each of the chieftains and two advisors for each of them. It elected a lögsögumaðr (literally: law, say, man) or lawspeaker for a three-year term. He was to recite one-third of the law at each annual meeting of the General [Page 87] Assembly. The lögrétta made law, changed law, and declared what the law would be if there were disagreements. A lögkaup was a lawful bargain; a löggarð was a lawful fence; and a löghlið was a lawful gate. A lögbók was a lawbook. Lög attached to something else generally meant something to do with law.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_355_IsCommw]//'The general assembly could make law and both the Alþingi and local assemblies could hear and judge cases. Verdicts were more influenced by the relative power of the two sides in the case than procedure, concepts of justice, or argument (Jones 1935, 21). Most cases were resolved by violence or arbitration (Miller 1984). The winner won the right to carry out a verdict. Neither the assemblies nor any other body had any power to enforce verdicts. Thus the influence of a verdict from an assembly was only as strong as the winner's power to carry it out. In Hœnsa-Þóris saga the relative strengths of the parties are described and how they fared in their armed confrontations with each other, but not the bases of their arguments or procedures at the assemblies. To the author, the important dimension of the cases at the assemblies was the strength of each side, and he indicates that this determined the verdict. This is quite general, especially in the thirteenth century (Durrenberger unp.).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_356_IsCommw]//'The decisions rendered in judicial matters could, indeed, be enforced in a general way by the public at large. If a person was fined, outlawed or banished, the people would know how to make the decree effective. But if the guilty person was a powerful chieftain, he might defy both the law and the court, and blood-feud would be resorted to as a final settlement of the dispute. Even the Althing itself, though hedged about with all the inviolability of a sanctuary, became at times the scene of bloody conflicts between angry litigants and their adherents, as no armed force existed which could maintain order and prevent violent outbreaks. Cases of bloodshed and disorder at the thing were indeed exceptional, but several instanced recorded in the sagas show the utter helplessness of the assembly, if the chieftain chose to ignore its decrees and disregard its sanctity.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_357_IsCommw] [Although Alþingi was not primarily a collective ritual it certainly included such elements both in pagan (one must assume) and Christian times. But Alþingi was not a ritual in itself although it included some ritual elements. We cannot point to a specific ritual at Alþingi that would fit this and so we should probably not include it here.] Accordingly, we may have to decide on another ritual instead.+++++++++++</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> 'About A.D. 930, the general assembly (Althing), the major institution of Commonwealth Iceland, was established.

[In pagan times these would be ‘blót’ (presumably) but in Christian times mass.][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Farmstead chapels were generally small, modest structures: 'The political institution of chieftaincy (GOÐORÐ) was rooted in religious function, a priestly office of intermediary between the community and supernatural forces. It is unclear the degree to which the role of chieftains had been secularized by the occupation of Iceland, but it is likely chiefs played a continued role in local religious activities by performing rites and sacrifices. Religious activities were not exclusive to chieftains. Individuals played a variety of intermediary between the mundane and supernatural roles including private devotions, divination, and sorcery. The conversion to Christianity brought with it the institutions of priest and bishop to Iceland. Throughout much of the early period, the institutional power of the church was weak. Churches were located on privately owned farmlands and were built and maintained by the local farmers who maintained a priest or served as priest himself. The early farm churches were small and probably served little more than the household and immediate neighbors.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_423_IsCommw]//'Not many of the colonists in Iceland who had learned to know Christianity had accepted it as a distinct worship. Usually they were so little informed as to the Christian doctrine that they regarded Christ as only as a god among other gods, as did Helgi Magri, of whom it is said that he was much mixed in his faith. He named his home Kristnes in honor of Christ, but though he was nominally a baptized Christian, he prayed to Thor when he was in distress or in danger on the sea. His sons Ingjald and Hrolf seem to have been wholly pagan, as they built temples and sacrificed to the heathen gods. Even those who called themselves Christians could not read; they had no priests to instruct them or to preach the gospel to them. In the midst of heathen surroundings they were able only to cling as well as they could to the outward symbols of Christianity. When they built a church they placed a simple cross on the altar, possibly also a few candles, as the structure, undoubtedly, was windowless and dark. Before this altar they knelt to do reverence to the cross, as they had seen Christians do in Ireland and elsewhere, and they would repeat the name of Christ or some favorite saint, which must have been in the main their church service. It was a dim light this Christianity which they knew, but it was the light of the world, which brought with it new moral and social ideals. They knew that Christianity taught charity, forgiveness, purity of life, principles wholly wanting in the old faith, and the new ideals attracted them and touched their hearts. [...] For want of aid and encouragement the early Christians in Iceland gradually lapsed into the paganism which surrounded them, but the influence of their faith helped to pave the way for the missionaries who came to preach Christianity a hundred years later.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_424_IsCommw]//'The lack of efficient organization which gradually enabled lawless violence to undermine the state was felt to some extent also in the church. Moral laxity and open disregard for the most fundamental Christian teachings were everywhere apparent. The common clergy continued to be a distinctly inferior type, and disciplinary authority was so feebly exercised that prevailing practices often deviated sharply from established church polity. Celibacy of the clergy had not been introduced in Iceland. The choise of bishops, which after the Second Lateran Council in 1139 had been left principally to the cathedral chapters, was here exercised by the Althing with the advice and assistance of the bishops, an arrangement which virtually placed the hcoiceof bishops in the hands of the aristocracy. Priests would often assume the management of cases brought before the Althing, and took so active a part in the bitter quarrels that they were in danger of becoming hostile partisans rather than spiritual advisers and preachers of the gospel. A stricter general supervision was begun in 1152, when Iceland was joined to the new archdiocese of Nildaros in Norway. The gifted and powerful Norwegian archbishop Eystein Erlendsson (1157-1188) inaugurated a policy of reform. He sharpened church discipline, and sought to eradicate flagrant abuses. But even he was able to accomplish but little in the face of the insolent opposition of the chieftains. In letters to the Icelandic bishops he vigorously assailed the prevailing violence and immorality.'

Assume the same to apply in Iceland as elsewhere in Christian Europe. Unknown for pagan times.] Accordingly, the following codes and descriptions are tentative and provisional at best. We have left them for the time being, but changes may be expedient. Possibly feasts held on joyous occasions, such as weddings. Feasting practiced in domestic settings had pre-Christrian roots: 'Feasting was central to Norse ceremonials and its context was mostly domestic, occurring within the house. The debris of feasting is thus something that archeologists regularly recover when excavating farmstead middens. Yet the everyday menu of rural Norse farmers would not have included freshly slaughtered domestic animals. Sheep and cattle were slaughtered on special occasions of sacrifice and feasting, producing exceptional quantities of discarded animal bone. Rather than treating faunal assemblages as deriving from "domestic" and "mundane" household events, archeologists must recognise that large quantities of animal bone are likely to be the residues of ritual and ceremonial events (Parker Pearson 2000, 2003).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_481_IsCommw]//Gjerset provides a general description of the atmosphere and proceedings: 'That the spirit of hospitality and love of festive social entertainment which always characterized the Norsemen should continue to flourish in Iceland is natural. This old custom not only gave zest to life in an otherwise bleak and comfortless environment, but it developed grace and skill in conversation, and fostered in the stern and apathetic popular character the traits of generous kindness which continue to distinguish the Icelandic people. Festivities of various kinds were of common occurrence especially in the leading families. During pagan times the yearly religious festivals were the vetrnoetr, or beginning of winter (October 14), the midsvetrar-blót (January 12), and sumardagr, or first day of summer (April 14), when sacrificial feasts usually took place in the temples accompanied by general social pastime. Weddings and funerals were always elaborately celebrated. Occasionally, too, the godi and his retinue had to be entertained for several days when he made his tour through the district, and private parties were often arranged for a large number of invited guests. On such occasions the walls of the stofa were draped with woven tapestries, fire was kindled on the fireplace, and cushions were placed on the benches for the guests. Great quantities of food were provided, as the tables had to display liberality and plenty. Great care had to be taken to place the guests according to rank and dignity at the proper distance to the right and left of the high-seat, since mistakes on this point might lead to serious misunderstandings. The women occupied the pallr, or thverpallr, a bench extending from one wall to the other toward the rear end of the hall. But at the drinking feast which followed the meal men and women would often sit together in couples, and as mead and beer were served in abundance, overindulgence in these strong beverages was not uncommon. Over the mead cup the spirit of conviviality gained full sway. Songs were declaimed, sagas were recited, or sharp irritating word-duels were indulged in, which often ended in quarrels and bloodshed. At greater festivals it was customary for young men to empty the bragarfull, or promise cup, and to to make a solemn vow to do some notable deed. At the termination of the feast, which often lasted several days, the host would give the guests presents, and accompany them on the way, where the final formal leave was taken. The number of guests at weddings, funerals and other festive gatherings was often very large.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_482_IsCommw]//Feasts could be very costly, especially when the hosts were influential families: 'Costly mantles were often given as presents by chieftains who wished to show their munificence and desired to do a friend special honor (...] The custom of giving costly presents, like scarlet mantles, saddle horses or large sums of money, was quite universally practiced throughout Europe in the Middle Ages, and conformed, no doubt, to the conception of a liberality worthy of princes and men of high station.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_483_IsCommw]//Dancing and singing may have been introduced during the Commonwealth Period: 'The dance seems to have been unknown in early ages, but it was introduced from the Scandinavian countries, where it developed in connection with romantic folk-songs in the twelfth century, and it soon became a popular public amusement. Men and women would join hands in a large circle, and would move with rhythmic steps to the chanting of some favorite ballad. This pastime was in all its features a distinctly new departure. Before the introduction of Christianity even singing was unknown except in magic incantations, and music, which was limited to the simplest instruments, the harp, the flute and trumpet, was little practiced. These new social features of foreign origin, music and the dance, as well as the singing of romantic love songs, could gain entrance only in the face of adverse public sentiment, but they heralded a time when the chief interest should be transferred from the duelling ground to the drawing room, when the old martial spirit should be tempered with new social ideals.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_484_IsCommw]//'Few scaldic songs have been preserved in complete form. For the most part only fragments are found as quotations in later prose works, so that, according to Finnur Jonsson, not over a one-hundredth part of the old scaldic poetry has been preserved. These fragments deal principally with historical events, the warlike achievements of the kings and chieftains in whose honor the songs have been written. But it is clear that the interest of the scalds was not limited to this general themes, though the laudatory martial verses give the general tone and character to scaldic poetry. Not infrequently did the scalds devote their entire poems to quite different themes, as did Egill Skallagrimsson in his "Sonatorrek" and Ulf Uggason in his "Húsdrápa". Lovesongs, though condemned by the social etiquette of those times, were nevertheless composed by mane noted scalds like Kormak Önundsson, Thormod Kolbrunarskald and Björn Hitdaelakappi. Often the scalds would encourage their hearers to wisdom, moderation, justice, faithfulness and other manly virtues. They taught the young men what virtues were to be admired and what vices would bring dishonour and contempt. At times they were able also to strike more tender chords which gave expression to the deepest emotions. Their art projected itself into every field and stirred the national spirit to daring and adventure. It became a conventional mode of public utterance, giving expression to the people's thoughts and sentiments -a force so great that even kings would bow before it in silence.'

Assume the same to apply in Iceland as elsewhere in Christian Europe. Unknown for pagan times.] Accordingly, the following information is tentative and provisional at best. We have left the following material for the time being, but it might need changing. There are two possible rituals who can qualify as the most dysphoric ritual during the Icelandic Commonwealth. The first option is to code for the highly formal and ritualistic form of duelling. Evidence is however relatively circumstantial as we only have sagas referring to these duels and only for the period 930 CE to 1100 CE. For the period 1100 CE to 1262 CE there is no evidence (although it is unsure whether this meant that the tradition had stopped). Duels took place to settle personal dispute. Risk of death was very real, but death was not always the outcome as one side could ask to be spared during the duel. The second option is to code for the tradition to eat bereserk mushrooms and then to go on a rampage. However, as absolutely nothing more is know, we will code here for the duel. According to Gjerset, competitive games and mock fights were a popular pastime and often escalated into violent quarrels: 'These new social features of foreign origin, music and the dance, as well as the singing of romantic love songs, could gain entrance only in the face of adverse public sentiment, but they heralded a time when the chief interest should be transferred from the dueling ground to the drawing room, when the old martial spirit should be tempered with new social ideals. According to the old conception all amusements were to subserve the one prime purpose fo strenghtening the body and training the mind for feats of arms by developing physical skill, courage and martial spirit. Swimming, hunting,skating, ski-running, wrestling, jumping and training in the use of weapons were regarded as the proper pastime for young men, as bravery was the virtue most to be desired. The same spirit also pervaded the distinctly national sports, the playing of ball (knattleikr) and horse-fighting. The game of ball was evidently very different from its present form, thought the details of the game are not known. Two men were pitted against each other.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_536_IsCommw] The eminent political institutions of Commonwealth Iceland were the chieftaincy and its associated courts and assemblies: 'At the time of Iceland’s settlement, Norse people worshiped gods whom they called æsir (singular áss), and this religion left behind an extensive mythology in Icelandic literature. Thor seems to have been the most popular of the pagan gods in Iceland, although Odin is thought to have been the highest in rank. It appears that heathen worship was organized around a distinct class of chieftains called godar (singular godi), of which there were about 40. In the absence of royal power in Iceland, the godar were to form the ruling class in the country. By the end of the settlement period, a general Icelandic assembly, called the Althing, had been established and was held at midsummer on a site that came to be called Thingvellir. This assembly consisted of a law council (lögrétta), in which the godar made and amended the laws, and a system of courts of justice, in which householders, nominated by the godar, acted on the panels of judges. At the local level, three godar usually held a joint assembly in late spring at which a local court operated, again with judges nominated by the godar. All farmers were legally obliged to belong to a chieftaincy (godord) but theoretically were free to change their allegiance from one godi to another; the godar were allotted a corresponding right to expel a follower. Some scholars have seen in this arrangement a resemblance to the franchise in modern societies. On the other hand, there was no central authority to ensure that the farmers would be able to exercise their right in a democratic way. No one was vested with executive power over the country as a whole. In any case, no trace of democratic practice reached farther down the social scale than to the heads of farming households; women and workers (free or enslaved) had no role in the political system.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_IsCommw] 'One of the peculiarities of early Iceland was the lack of formal state institutions. The legislature, extensive law code, and judicial system of local and higher courts left prosecution and the enforcement of settlements in the hands of individuals. From an early date, the country was divided into Quarters. Each quarter constituted a broad community with three assemblies (ÞINGS), with the exception of the Northern Quarter that had four, and a system of local courts. Once a year the General Assembly (ALÞINGI) met in the southwest of Iceland. Judicial cases that could not be resolved in local quarters were heard and the parliament (LÖGRÉTTA) convened. The parliament was the principal legislative institution and was responsible for the introduction and maintanence of law. It consisted of chieftains (GOÐAR) from the local quarters. After the conversion to Christianity, the two Icelandic bishops were each given a seat in the parliament. The institution of chieftaincy (GOÐORÐ) was the main locus of political leadership in the country. Originally there were 36 but this number was later expanded. Chieftaincies themselves were a form of property and could be alienated and even divided among multiple individuals. In some cases, individuals asserted power beyond the scope of the political system and controlled multiple chieftaincies. All independent farmers had to be affiliated with a chieftain, although they could choose among any of the chieftains in their quarter and could switch allegiances if they did not feel that their needs were being met. Other than a seat on the parliament, chieftains had few rights beyond those of other independent farmers and few institutional means of dominating others.

For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the rst was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage. It was tantamount to downing a beer and a sandwich and calling that the eucharist, or diving into a pond several times and calling that baptism writ large. This simply could not be. It was not only a “legal impossibility,” as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too. Medieval writers labeled such misuses of the concept and institution of marriage by Christians as “heresy,” “blasphemy,” and “desecration” - an insult to God and his sacraments.

Other sins, serious though punishable by death, were: stealing (Ex 21.37-22.3), slandering one's wife (Dt 22.13-19), seducing a virgin (Ex 22.15-16), etc. [...] Effects of Sin. Guilt. As a result of revolt against God, a sense of guilt arose."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_601_IsCommw] "Guilt is the state or condition of being at fault (reatus culpae) and so deprived of supernatural life, the absence of the splendor of which is a stain (macula peccati) on the soul, and also the state or condition of being liable to the penalty due in punishment for the fault."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_602_IsCommw] It's worth noting, however, that it's not very clear how much of Christian morality was adopted by Icelanders at this time, and in what form.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ general supernatural enforcement of morality ♣ suspected unknown: 930-1055 CE; inferred present: 1056-1262 CE ♥</b> Norse morality is relatively poorly understood, especially as much of what we know about Norse beliefs generally was recorded by Christian authors. Christianity: "[A]fter the Resurrection, when God and Jesus appear to pass judgement, one must 'render an account' (Matt. 12:36). Death ends the day during which good works are to be done, and then, 'the night cometh, when no man can work' (John 9:4). Everyone's work will be tried in fire and revealed (1 Cor, 3:12-13). The just, whom God will gather to His right, receive 'life everlasting', the merciless, however, who stand to His left, 'shall go into everlasting punishment' (Matt. 25:46). Everything is decided with death and that gives both life and death the weight of finality."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_603_IsCommw] It's worth noting, however, that it's not very clear how much of Christian morality was adopted by Icelanders at this time, and in what form.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other supernatural enforcement ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Norse morality: "Writing in Gylfaginning , Snorri alludes to Vafthrúdnismál, stanza 23, which personifies the sun and moon. But Snorri has a somewhat different and more elaborate story: Mundilfoeri is a man who had two children who were so beautiful that he named them Máni and Sól (i.e., Moon and Sun), and he married Sól to a man called Glen. Thereafter the gods punished this act of pride by placing the children in heaven to serve the actual heavenly bodies, which the gods had created. Sól drives the horses that pull the sun, and Máni controls the motion of the moon and its waxings and wanings. [...] The implication that the act of pride was marrying his daughter to Glen, and not naming one’s children Sun and Moon, is right there in Snorri, but like most people I prefer to ignore it and think that the gods punished Mundilfoeri for the names and not the marriage. There is certainly no evidence that Sól’s marriage to Glen annoyed the gods, for indeed there is no other evidence whatever about this marriage."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_604_IsCommw] Christianity: perseverance in the face of persecution.

In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.” How is top nobility different from other nobility? And is the ‘elite’ all of the upper class or just a part of it. Upper classes in historical and modern societies usually number about 1-2% of the population. Is this what is meant by ‘top nobility’ and then why top (there usually isn’t any nobility in the remaining 99%)? However, one can normally differentiate between two layers of the upper class: a gentry (or similar) that makes up the bulk of the upper class population and is mostly important locally and in the polity as a group, and then the high nobility, a much more select group where people are important to the polity as individuals.
