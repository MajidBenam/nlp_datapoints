evidence of his great judgment, because it is now becoming increasingly clearer that the Xia state is represented archaeologically: since 1959, evidence of its culture has been continuously unearthed at the type site Erlitou, just east of Luoyang in northwestern Henan province. The archaeological remains of this Erlitou culture are now found scattered throughout southern Shanxi and north- western Henan and are dated to 1900-1350 B.C., coinciding in time and in space with the Xia dynasty as described in ancient texts. Was there a Xia dynasty? Present evidence suggests that there indeed was a Xia dynasty. That Sima Qian selected Xia from among many contemporary polities was probably because during the earliest part of the Chinese Bronze Age or the Three Dynasties period, Xia was most powerful. If Erlitou can be identified with Xia, this is indeed true."

Erlitou reached the zenith of its expansion, to around 300 ha, during Erlitou phases II-IV, traditionally dated to c. 1800-1550 BC but recently ascribed to c. 1700-1530 BC (Liu and Xu 2007; Zhang et al. 2007) (Fig. 3)."

Relying on both historical sources and archaeological data, the team dated the Xia Dynasty to 2070-1600 BC and the Shang to 1600-1046 BC." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CnErlit][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1850-1600 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "These dates are based on both the radiocarbon dates published in Xia Shang Zhou Duandai Gongcheng Zhuanjiazu [hereafter XSZDGZ] (2000) and ZSKY (2003). Previous work had suggested that Erlitou dated from 1900-1500 BCE for a total of 400 years with each phase being about 100 years long (Qiu, Cai, Xian, and Bo 1983; ZSKY 1999). Recent radiocarbon work using “wiggle-matching” techniques have dated the site between 1750 and 1520 BCE, reducing Erlitou site occupation to a mere 200 years, the last 50 or so years claimed to be under Shang occupation (Qiu, Cai and Zhang 2006). If this is really the case then the “Erlitou expansion” during Erlitou II and III was both rapid and short-lived (see discussion below)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_CnErlit][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1850-1550 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "The Erlitou site is located in the Luoyang city area in the eastern Luoyang basin. The most abundant cultural remains at the site belong to the Erlitou culture, dating to about 3800-3500 BP (c.1850-1550 BC). This date is contemporary with the historically documented Xia and Shang dynasties (Du and Xu 2005)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_CnErlit]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> "Erlitou, rather than being a departure, continued the third-millennium pattern of megasites, centering an expansive sphere of material cultural influence (Figure 2.1). At the same time, a number of features that were to become central to Central Plains Bronze Age elite traditions, such as a rectangular, walled “palace-temple” district; rammed earth monumental courtyard structures; and bronze ritual vessels, apparently made their first appearance at Erlitou (Figures 2.2-2.6). The Erlitou tradition, however, was not alone on the Mainland East Asian stage. The land between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers was home to a variety of local and regional ceramic and other material cultural traditions beyond those of Erlitou." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CnErlit][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The political organization of the polity centered at Erlitou is unclear. Erlitou sat atop a settlement hierarchy of unknown size,48 and for perhaps a century, maybe less (1700-1600 BCE), it was the largest urban center in East Asia for which we have evidence (Shimao may overlap with the early phases of Erlitou; Sanxingui, with at least the late phases; and Yanshi and Zhengzhou were probably both major centers by the Erlitou phase IV). While the Erlitou ceramic tradition was widespread, the mechanisms of this expansion are probably only indirectly related to political activity (if pots don’t equal people, they are even less representative of conquering armies or “state” administrators). The degree of centralization, mechanisms of political control, and social organization can only be guessed at or extrapolated through comparison with Zhengzhou and Anyang. This comparison can justifiably be made insofar (and only insofar) as many of Erlitou’s elite cultural forms appear to be ancestral to those found at Zhengzhou and Anyang, from architecture, to symbols of status and implements of ritual.49 Nevertheless, as will be discussed in more detail later on, there are considerable qualitative and quantitative differences between Erlitou, Zhengzhou, and Anyang, making their comparison—and especially the derivation of the lesser known from the better known—a more complex problem than most have credited. Seen in regional context, if Erlitou has its civilizational sphere (Baines and Yoffee 1998; Allan 2007), it was not alone." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnErlit]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b>"It would seem that during the height of the Erlitou site’s power (and by extension the Erlitou or “Xia” polity), fortified centers associated with the Erligang (or early Shang) polity were already appearing in the same region. Currently available C14 samples date phase III of the Erlitou site—the period associated with the most notable evidence of the site’s prosperity—to c. 1610-1550 (or even 1530) calibrated years BC, while Erligang sites such as Zhengzhou (郑州) and Yanshi (偃师) date from c. 1600 BC (Zhang et al. 2007; Zhongguo 2003, pp. 659-663). In particular, the location of Yanshi, only 6 km northeast of Erlitou, raises questions about the relationships between the two cultures and the polities they represent."

For example, among pottery vessel types, the ding and the dou are found in every region, often in large numbers, suggesting the wide distribution of a style of cooking formerly prevailing only in the Dawenkou and Daxi cultures. The perforated slate rectangular and semilunar knives represent another horizon marker, as do some pottery and jade art motifs that, as pointed out earlier, may reflect deeper substratal commonalities than recent contact. With the definition of "interaction spheres," for the first time we can discuss the issue of the name "China." I suggest that from this point on, as the regions with which we are concerned came to be joined together in archaeological terms and exhibit increasing similarities, the interaction sphere may be referred to as "Chinese."

According to one recent model, it extended as far south as Panlongcheng (about 500 km!) and about 100-150 km northwestward to sites such as Dongxiafeng (东下冯) and Nanguan (南关). This expansion is often said to have involved the aggressive conquering of faraway lands, along with the establishment of colonies crucial for the extraction and acquisition of particular resources that were essential for Erlitou’s functioning as a governing state (Liu 2004, pp. 232-234; Liu and Chen 2003)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnErlit][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Some archaeologists are inclined to classify it as a territorial state with no serious rivals. In their view Erlitou was an expansionist state that had established colonies well beyond the Yilou region, reaching north and south into a large area between the middle Yellow River and the middle Yangzi River. The motive behind the expansion, they argue, was to produce copper, tin, lead, and salt for the core area's people and workshops. On balance, however, the evidence seems to favor something more modest, a polity confined to the Yilou basin, comparable in size to a large city-state in Mesopotamia or Mesoamerica."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnErlit][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Lesser / City-state model[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "If we use the same methods for delineating the political borders of Erlitou as those used for the Longshan polities, it would seem that the Erlitou polity may have extended no further than perhaps 70 km in each direction, somewhat larger than the Longshan period polities but still not spreading out beyond the local region."

Larger sites are distributed at intervals, revealing a large, structured network of settlements. The Shaochai 稍柴 site (60ha) seems to be located in the eastern section of a vital communication route in the Luoyang basin. In addition to being a secondary center, the important functions of this settlement included protecting the capital and transferring resources (Chen Xingcan et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2004: 75-100). More than 20 sites dating to the Erlitou period (10-30 ha in size) have been found in the surrounding area. Some sites have remains of white pottery or ritual drinking vessels of delicate pottery. These other Erlitou period sites (including burials) are concentrated around Songshan 嵩山 (Mt Song), including the area from Zhengzhou to Luoyang, and the area from the Yinghe and Ruhe rivers to Sanmenxia city. The sites are all large or medium-sized settlements located in valleys and basins. They must have been regional centers in the core area of the Erlitou state (Nishie 2005). The city discovered at Dashigu 大师姑 (51ha), 70km east of the Erlitou site, might be a military town at the eastern edge of the Erlitou state territory, or the center of another polity (Zhengzhou Kaogusuo 2004). We can conclude that there was a four- tiered settlement hierarchy in the Erlitou culture consisting of a large capital settlement, regional centers, secondary centers, and numerous small villages. This settlement pattern is in sharp contrast to the Longshan settlement pattern in which various regional centers coexisted and competed for power." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_CnErlit][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"A four-tier regional settlement hierarchy appeared during the Erlitou period, signifying the domination of the Erlitou site (as the paramount center) over a state-level system with at least three levels of political control above ordinary villages (Liu and Chen 2003, following the definition by Wright 1977). [...] Criticism has been leveled at different elements of this reconstruction.

For example, the identification of the main public structures in Erlitou as palaces has been challenged: palaces are usually defined as multifunctional buildings, serving as the king’s residence and also as the central hub of state administration (Flannery 1998, pp. 22-36). The Erlitou complexes, despite being composed of large walled courtyards with roofed buildings, are actually quite small.

In the center of this area, test probes have located a number of pounded-earth terraces and building foundations. The largest so far excavated is a square terrace more than 100 m on a side (Fig. 3.11). This was constructed by pounding thin layers of earth into an excavation up to 2 m deep and then continuing to add layers until a height of 80 cm above the surrounding ground was reached. Individual layers are about 4.5 cm thick; their upper surfaces carry the circular impressions of pounding tools 3—5 cm in diameter. The terrace was enclosed by an earthen wall with a gate in the south side; lines of post holes parallel to the wall show that a roofed structure was built against it. Inside the enclo- sure was a pounded-earth building foundation that had been constructed before the rest of the terrace. Judging from post holes, the building it carried was a large rectangular wood-framed hall measuring 30 m east—west and 11 m north—south. The post holes along the south side are set well back from the edge of the foundation, so the hall must have had an unroofed porch. Just outside the line of post holes is a line of smaller holes; if these were left by eave supports, they imply a hipped roof, for they encircle the building. A few traces of earth mixed with straw might be remains of the walls or the roof. No other evidence of walls was found, but the hall of a similar compound nearby was enclosed and divided into three rooms by walls of wattle and daub.

The technology used to cast bronze vessels —the piece-mold or section-mold technique— was already developed by the Erlitou period, but it reached a much higher level of sophistication during this period. Vessel shapes were now much more varied than before and much more lavishly decorated. The complexity and sheer size of some of these vessels show their casting to have been a real technological achievement. For example, one bronze square ding (fangding 方鼎) dated to the Erligang period is 100 cm tall and weighs 86.4 kg. More bronze was used to cast this single vessel than was used for all of the known Erlitou vessels combined. Another example is three hoards of bronze objects discovered in the outer city of Zhengzhou, containing 28 bronzes with a total weight of over 500 kg (Thorp 2006, pp. 89-91). Mold parts found at the different bronze workshops in Zhengzhou suggest that one, the Nanguanwai (南关外), specialized in the production of ritual vessels (although it also produced tools and weapons), while another, Zijingshan (紫荆山), produced few vessels, if any, and focused instead on weapons and small tools (Fig. 8) (Henan 2001, pp. 307-383).

Although no city site comparable to Panlongcheng has been excavated elsewhere, typical Erligang bronzes have been found throughout a large part of North and Central China. Since the bronzes are indistinguishable from Zhengzhou counterparts no matter where they are found, they argue that the dispersion of the Erligang civilization was not a gradual process but a sharply defined event. It seems difficult to imagine any mechanism other than conquest that could spread a uniform inventory of bronze artifacts and a complex technology in a short space of time over so large an area, and the evidence of archaeology is thus that the Erligang period saw not only the formation of a civilization but also a sudden territorial expansion. The expansion seems, however, to have been short-lived. After the Erligang period bronzes no longer exhibit any widespread stylistic uniformity; nothing comparable is seen again in the archaeological record before the Zhou period. The next few centuries instead witnessed the rise of local bronze-using cultures, and presumably of local powers, in regions which before the arrival of the Erligang civilization probably had no knowledge of metallurgy (and metallurgy may be only the visible part of a larger debt). The most impressive and at the moment best-known regional bronze culture of the time immediately following the Erligang period was centered in northern Jiangxi, some 300km south of Panlongcheng, at modern Wucheng and Xin'gan on the Gan River. Here, just beyond the reach of the Erligang expansion, we find a local culture pushed over the threshold of civilization by contact with the culture of the north." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_193_CnErlit][MAJIDBENAM_BR]War between Erlitou and Erligang?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"There are other reasons why many scholars believe Yanshi was an important military town. First, Yanshi is located only 6km away from Erlitou, the capital of the Erlitou culture. Most scholars in China believe that Erlitou was the capital city of the Xia dynasty, whose residents were the enemy of Shang. Second, the large, inner walled area at the Shang city of Zhengzhou that was contemporaneous with, or a little earlier than, the city of Yanshi is 300ha in size, while Yanshi is only 81ha in size. The unusually small size suggests that Yanshi had a special function. Third, as mentioned above, the concave and convex sections of the city walls seem to represent a conscious design for defense. The remains of a large arsenal or storage area for weapons also indicate the military function of the site."

However, hunting appears to have been an important ritual in prehistoric China, at least starting in the late Longshan [MAJIDBENAM_REF_286_CnErlit]. Therefore, it may be reasonable to reconstruct ritual hunting for the Erlitou, based on what is known about this practice in earlier (Longshan) and later (Shang) periods. "Meat is always the principal food in feasts. Since meat is not a daily component of the diet in agricultural communities, the offering of an expensive animal for sacrifice is reason enough to gain prestige (cf. Clarke 2001: 160). Therefore, skilled hunters would have greater opportunities to promote their social status in a community. This may have been the situation applying to the household in T26 [at the late Longshan site of Kangjia], which yielded evidence for specialized hunting (H79). In addition, hunting animals may carry symbolic meanings other than merely obtaining protein. Hunting in many complex societies is a strongly ritualized activity and success in hunting frequently is taken as evidence of supernatural approval and support (Helms 1992a). Therefore, successful hunting would ideologically reinforce the prestige of individuals and social groups. "This symbolic aspect of hunting may be observed in the late Shang dynasty, in which hunting was one of the significant ritual activities of the royal court. The animals, used as ritual sacrifice, played a role to link the kings with supernatural power (Fiskesjö 2001; Keightley 2000: 107-113). It is notable that the Shang kings’ favorite game include buffalo and deer (Lefeuvre 1990-1991; Yang Zhongjian and Liu 1949). More interestingly, Shang kings even traveled to the lower Wei River valley to hunt. As recorded by Sima Qian in 'Yin benji' in Shiji, King Wuyi was killed by lightning during a hunt in an area between the Wei and Yellow rivers. Hunting associated with economic, political and symbolic power may have had a long tradition back to the Neolithic period in this region, and the consumption of wild animals in ritual feasting was a tangible medium materializing the intangible symbolic power." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_287_CnErlit] "Hunts that involved killing dangerous animals (as opposed to more docile animals such as domesticates, less aggressive herbivores, or smaller animals) and that also involved displays of people’s courage, prowess, and strength may have been both euphoric and dysphoric, involving such aspects as pride (in displaying prowess), exhilaration (surely a dramatic chase would be exhilarating), but also fear/terror depending on circumstances, such as the hunter being chased by the game or other scenes of danger."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_369_CnErlit] Evidence for sacrificial remains at the Erlitou site itself as well as nearby sites, such as children bound and buried in pits and under housing foundations at Yanshi Shangcheng. Excavators (site report 1999~2006) believe there is a sacrificial area at the Erlitou site (Yanshi Erlitou) that is located in the central and eastern part of the site, north and northeast of the palatial area. I couldn’t find any reporting of details of this area in the massive site report (5 large volumes) but managed to chase down two of the references provided in a brief description of the area. These references (Du 1989 and Zheng 1998, in Chinese) describe, without any diagrams, a special area with structures and pits, abnormally buried human burials, burnt surfaces. The excavator mentions that this is a special burial and sacrificial place that requires more attention. A second article, again with no diagrams, describes a burial area with unusual structures (different than houses) and child burials under wall foundations though the author does not mention whether the burials may be related to foundation sacrifice. It seems that the implication is that the structure(s) may be religious structures and that the area was a sacrificial area. This is indeed how it is described in the massive excavation report.
