was in accord with the self-sufficiency of the agrarian life. Not much differentiation of occupation nor contact with the outside world was required, and the state became the guardian against disturbance, interfering only when there was a threat to tranquility. The punggawa, or official, within his region wielded the power of administrator, judge, and commander of the local contingent of troops. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IdMatrm] Amangkurat I (Sultan Agung's son) attempted to consolidate the empire and to centralise its administration and finances. He hoped to turn an empire which Sultan Agung had based on military might into a unified kingdom where resources were monopolised for the benefit of the king. However communication, population and geographical factors proved impossible to overcome and Amangkurat I brought about the greatest rebellion in the seventeenth century and allowed for the intervention of the VOC.

It seems that the Majapahit structure of the ruler and a few top functionaries with varying influence was retained. There were various different titles for functionaries, but it is unclear whether there was a particular hierarchical structure between them, and moreover the relationship of these functionaries to powerful coastal regions, and the administrative structures within these regions, is far from clear and there was probably much fluidity and development over time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IdMatrm] Moertono shows that in later Mataram (possibly after the VOC came to dominate) there was a ligion including rendering justice in disputes under the jurisdiction of Islamic law. Thseparate and more independent department, the reh pangulon, which was responsible for matters of ree institution of the penggulu (head of the clergy in the main mosque in the king's capital) was gradually incorporated into the administrative system as head of a special division. The penggulu had his say about appointing lower penggulu naibs, who each administered the religious affairs of a certain number of villages. These lower officials were not thought of as belonging to the king's administration, for unlike other royal officials they did not receive income from the king.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IdMatrm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ [1-3] ♥</b> levels. Moertono says that generally the Islamic clergy did not have an organized hierarchical structure in the sense of the Christian church. However, once religious specialists began to be more intertwined with the state administration in later Mataram, some hierarchies of power did develop (see 'Administrative Levels').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IdMatrm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> levels.

The feelers represented special troops of amok fighters, the body of the crayfish was the sovereign, preceded by sons and relatives, the commander and ministers, and other numbers represented troops of different nobles and officials.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IdMatrm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

From six in the morning until midnight the orchestras play continuously, attracting thousands of people, especially from the rural areas, to watch and listen to the <i>Kyai Sekati gamelan</i> on the squares in front of the palaces and the mosques in the two court cities. During those days, the squares are transformed into an evening fair, <i>sekaten</i>, where people can watch various entertainments, for example, different folk play groups, magicians, comedians, and other attractions, and where people sell food and other things in restaurants as well as in stalls. On the evening of the eleventh, the Sultan [...], accompanied by [...] court dignitaries, retainers, and attendants, walk[s] in procession to the mosque to attend a religious service, which consists of prayers, a sermon, and a communal meal. After that the people taking part in the procession return to their palaces and the sacred <i>gamelan</i>; are put back into store, marking the end of the <i>sekaten</i> fair. "The <i>Garebeg Mulud</i> state ceremony, which is actually a grand audience, takes place the next morning. On that occasion the Sultan [...] sit[s] on the throne (<i>dampar kencana</i>) on the 'high ground' (<i>siti inggil</i>) to receive [his] guests. Among them are the relatives, dignitaries, attendants, chief ministers (<i>patih</i>), [etc.]. [...] On this occasion, the common people could watch their Head of State, and the climax of this event was the distribution of food offerings (<i>gunungan</i>) to the common people. These offerings consisted of ten to twelve giant rice cones of about 2 m. high, which were elaborately decorated." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_IdMatrm] NOTE: It is not very clear which was the largest ritual in Mataram. The two best candidates are both problematic: the enthronement ceremony, described by Moertono [MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_IdMatrm] was definitely performed, but it appears that only ruling elites were present, though this is not very clear; while the Garebeg Mulud definitely attracted large crowds, but the RAs could find no evidence that it was performed in Mataram. In the end, the latter was chosen, because it is fairly likely that it was performed in Mataram (it was already an important festival at the time of Dutch contact [MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_IdMatrm], and it features the characteristic Javanese blend of Islamic and pre-Islamic practices that started emerging in the sixteenth century), and, if did occur, it would have occurred more frequently than the enthronement ceremony.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> In the month of <i>Mulud</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_126_IdMatrm].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> In the month of <i>Mulud</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_IdMatrm].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> In the month of <i>Mulud</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_IdMatrm].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 168 ♥</b> hours. 1 week.

"Although references to a rampogan sima ritual, or something from which it may have developed, date from 1620 and 1700, we owe the first description of the event to Valentjin. He calls it a tiger fight and notes that it is also called tiger catching. On the occasion of a general meeting of the royal princes and the nobility, a number of solid structures were built for the ruler, the princes, and their women, on an open field. Then, about 10,000 pikemen went to an area where a tiger had been had been spotted in order to surround it and drive the tiger to the place where the Sunan was waiting. When the tiger had been encircled entirely, he tried to escape and was caught on the pikes. Usually, one or two Javanese lost their lives in these encounters.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"If this is an accurate description of what happened, then at this time the tiger-sticking ritual differed notably from the nineteenth-century 'model' sketched above. The location of the action was apparently not the alun-alun, but it must have been somewhere outside the capital. It was, indeed, a tiger hunt--Valentijn's 'tiger-catching'--more than anything else. It is important to note that the ruler did not participate in the hunt, even in the final stage."

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives.

There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar.

For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_423_IdMatrm] "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_424_IdMatrm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ present ♥</b> Islam prohibits cheating in trade. "Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with even scales (<i>when you weigh</i>). This is better, and will be the best in the end. [...](Qur'an, 17:31- 7)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_425_IdMatrm] Moreover, justice is one of the key Islamic virtues: <i>In all their dealings, Muslims are required to stand firmly for justice even if it be against themselves or their kith and kin: 'O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_426_IdMatrm] However, it's worth noting that "the adulteration of weights and measures" belonged to the domain of "non-Quranic law"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_427_IdMatrm].</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> "Classical Islamic constitutional law was concerned particularly with the issue of the legitimacy of leadership. The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are. Classical commentaries name secular rulers (umara' , sultan) as well as religious ahl al-qur'an wa-l-'ilm) or legal scholars (fuqaha'). "[MAJIDBENAM_REF_428_IdMatrm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> "Modesty or chastity is also an important virtue in the Islamic system of morality for all Muslims, men or women. To the true Muslim, man and woman alike, anything impure or degrading is abhorrent and to be avoided. Strict modesty of dress, manner and behaviour, and absolute chastity are required both before and after marriage. The most famous personal example of chastity in the Qur'an is the Virgin Mary: 'And (<i>remember that blessed woman</i>) who guarded her chastity' (21:91)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_429_IdMatrm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to be kind to one's parents: <i>Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you show kindness to your parents. If either or both of them attain old age with you, (show no sign of impatience, and) do not (even) say 'fie' to them; nor rebuke them, but speak kind words to them. And lower unto them the wing of humility and tenderness and say: 'Lord, be merciful to them both, as they did care for me when I was small.' Your Lord best knows what is in your minds. If you are righteous, He surely was ever Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). [...](17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_430_IdMatrm] In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void. [...] Other needy family members, such as parents, grandparents and grandchildren, may also claim a right to maintenance[...]."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_431_IdMatrm]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> "Beginning with the classical texts on Islamic law a fundamental bipartition of the world was evolved which would remain - with some modifications - the basis of all deliberation until well into the twentieth century. The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_432_IdMatrm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft. Traditional Islamic penal ordinances (hudud) distinguish between two kinds: al-sariqah al-sughra (simple theft), requiring amputation of the right hand, and al-sariqah al-kubra, the meaning of which is contested but which requires the amputation of the right hand and left foot. Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty. Hudud ordinances are considered primarily deterrant and, due to their strict evidentiary requirements, are rarely invoked."
