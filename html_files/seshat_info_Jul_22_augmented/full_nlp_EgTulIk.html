The Tulunids were a Turkic Dynasty who established an independent rule over Egypt and parts of Syria during a time of instability caused by infighting in the Abbasid court in Damascus. There was a notable 'flowering' of the arts under the Tulunid rulers,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgTulIk] but the highs and lows of this era of instability are best encapsulated by the reign of Khumarawayh. Although Egypt saw 'peace and prosperity' under his rule, it has been argued that his extravagant lifestyle and 'lavish' spending on building projects and the maintenance of a large standing army 'overtaxed the state's resources'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgTulIk] 'When Khumarawayh was murdered by one of his slaves in 896, the treasury was reportedly empty'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgTulIk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Egypt during the Tulunid-Ikshidid period has been described as 'an autonomous state, albeit under Abbasid suzerainty'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgTulIk] When Ahmad ibn Tulun was appointed prefect or governor of Egypt in 868 CE, it was a province of the Abbasid Caliphate. Tulun, who was of Turkish ancestry, was recruited from the military[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgTulIk][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgTulIk] and 'never formally repudiated Abbasid authority'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgTulIk] He took advantage of a revolt in Palestine and Syria to build up a new Egyptian army of Turkish, Nubian, and Greek mercenaries and slaves, which he paid for by seizing control of the revenue of Egypt from the Abbasid-appointed financial director in 871 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgTulIk] Ibn Tulun also annexed Syria.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_EgTulIk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]With his new army and the Abbasids distracted by unrest in the Levant, Ibn Tulun worked to increase Egyptian autonomy from the caliph in Baghdad;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_EgTulIk] he stopped sending taxes to the Abbasids and established a new capital at al-Qatai, at the neck of the Nile Delta near Fustat.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_EgTulIk] This de facto arrangement became official in 886 CE, when a treaty with the Abbasid Dynasty decreed that Khumarawayh and his successors would govern Egypt for a term of three decades[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_EgTulIk] - although Egypt would in fact be under Abbasid control again from 905 to 935 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_EgTulIk] After the Ikshidids gained control of Egypt under Muhammad ibn Tughj (935‒946 CE),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_EgTulIk] the Abbasids, in a similar treaty in 939 CE, granted the governorship of Egypt and Syria to 'the Ikshid and his heirs' for 30 years.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_EgTulIk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Tulunid governing apparatus included a vizier,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_EgTulIk] who, after the administrative reforms of Ibn Tulun,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_EgTulIk] apparently ran a competent bureaucracy that oversaw huge spending projects. Ibn Tulun built an aqueduct and a <i>maristan</i> (hospital), which cost 60,000 dinars.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_EgTulIk] Founded in 873 CE, the hospital was the first of its kind in Egypt. There was probably a functioning postal system (the Egyptian section of the Abbasid <i>barid</i>). Luxuries were never far away for the affluent elites, who spent their riches freely: Khumarawayh converted the <i>maydan</i> (city square) into a lush garden in the Mesopotamian tradition, while in the Ikshidid period Kafur's palace near the Birkat Qarun cost a monumental 100,000 dinars.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_EgTulIk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of Egypt and the Levant at this time may have totalled 6.5 million,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_EgTulIk] and the largest city, Fustat in Egypt, had perhaps 150,000 residents.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Tulunid Interregnum ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Tulunid_900CE: 868CE-969CE ♥</b>  Tulunid_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  1573954: 868CE-969CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Semitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Arabic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Sunni Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b> <i>these codes were reviewed at Seshat Workshops, Oxford 2016 and 2017</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgTulIk&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [800,000-1,000,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ibn Tulun, the founder of the Tulunid Dynasty, annexed Syria.

The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba. Furthermore, it is important to remember that almost all reform movements in the fringe areas of the Islamic world were triggered off by the pilgrimage. Faithful believers from Bengal and Nigeria, from Morocco and Central Asia, who had lived for some time in Mecca and exchanged their views with others who, like them, had experienced what seemed to be the 'true Arabic Islam', returned to their Page 39countries to fight the numerous indigenous superstitions and customs which had infiltrated the Islam of the masses and which now appeared to them like remnants of ancient paganism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_149_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, although "a pilgrim can start going into consecration (<i>ihram</i>) for Hajj earlier, from the beginning of the tenth month (Shawwal)".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_150_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_151_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> The inhabitants of Mecca, Medina and other important waypoints along the pilgrimage may be considered as "passive spectators or witnesses", as the Seshat codebook puts it.

It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_188_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> Every Friday.

It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_225_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> Every Friday.

It appears, however, that a carnival increasingly became its main function. The people drank wine and beer; there were those who ambushed travelers and sprayed them with filthy water or wine, and others threw eggs on one another. Even emirs and dignitaries were exposed to this sort of ridicule, and, to rescue themselves, they had to pay 'ransom.' Slapping one another with boots or leather mats in public places was possibly a remnant of a pagan ritual. Sexual overtones were expressed in the play of water games, causing men and women to become wet so that naked bodies could be seen through clothes. In 1188, the public gathering of transvestites and prostitutes is reported. Masquerades are reported during the celebration of 975. Puritan scholars of the Mamluk period lamented the adverse effect of the festival on both the common people and the learned. They reported that schools were shut down and turned into playgrounds and that teachers were insulted and sprayed with water. These writers found it detestable that the participants were able 'to commit all kinds of evil,' that 'there was no interdiction [to any sort of behavior] and no authority imposed.' "The high mark of Nawruz in medieval Cairo was the procession of the Emir of Nawruz, usually a wanton who was either naked or dressed in colorful clothes, his face besmeared with lime or flour and a beard of fur attached to his face, on his head a special cap made of palm leaves, riding a donkey in the streets. He held a sort of register in his hand, 'visited' homes of dignitaries to collect 'debts,' and punished those who refused to pay. Manifest in this procession is the carnivalesque element of status reversal and riotous revelry a ́la medieval Christian festivals such as the King of Fools."

The scene reminds Muslims of the gathering on the Day of Judgement. If any pilgrim misses this event, his/her Hajj is not valid and has to be done again another year. This does not apply to any other rite, all of which can be done over a longer period or compensated for with an offering. This is the time for the pilgrims to read the Qur’an, glorify God and pray most earnestly for forgiveness and everything else they wish for. Particularly recommended for glorification and repetition is this prayer, ‘There is no God but Allah alone, with no partner. Dominion and praise belong to Him, who gives life and death. Goodness is in His hands and He has power over everything.’ This just gives a succinct summary of the Islamic faith and connects the individual pilgrim to what Ibrahim and Muhammad brought and uttered. Pilgrims normally face towards the Ka‘ba while reciting these prayers, as they do for the five daily prayers, believing that, by doing this, their prayers are more likely to be accepted.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_303_EgTulIk]. This ritual is coded here as dysphoric due to the fact that pilgrims are required to stand for several hours (between noon and sunset) under the sun’s heat. A contemporary account, dating to 1997, notes that the “heat is virtually unbearable” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_304_EgTulIk]. However, it is worth noting that, due to peculiarities of the Islamic calendar, this ritual may sometimes be performed at a time of the year when the temperature is less hot than at other times, and when there are fewer others between noon and sunset than at other times. Moreover, a few informal online sources suggest that those who cannot stand in the sun for the duration of the ritual are allowed to be in the shade and/or sit down. Still, though relatively mild, this appears to be the most dysphoric ritual within Sunni Islam.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar [MAJIDBENAM_REF_305_EgTulIk].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_306_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 6 ♥</b> hours, on average.

We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2;. In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice. This could be termed an advance in civilization.

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives.

The Qur’an says ‘Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve’ (2:274).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_388_EgTulIk] “Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one’s brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one’s family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah’s command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_389_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> “The Arabic word waqf (pl. awqaf) means “the holding and preservation of a certain property for the confined benefit of a philanthropy with prohibiting any use or disposition of the property outside that specific purpose.” The definition indicates the perpetual nature of waqf as it broadly relates to land and buildings, although there is waqf of books, agricultural machinery, cattle, shares and stocks, and cash. [...] In the history of Islam, the first religious waqf was the mosque of Quba' in Medina. It was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad in 622. Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar. When he asked the Prophet what to do with a palm orchard he acquired in the city of Khaybar, the Prophet said, “If you like, you may hold the property as waqf and give its fruits as charity.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_390_EgTulIk]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> “In addition to observing various dietary practices, Muslims use food to celebrate holidays.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_431_EgTulIk][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Human Enforcement of Morality</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to care for the needy. "Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_432_EgTulIk] "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_433_EgTulIk] "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_434_EgTulIk] "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_436_EgTulIk] Moreover, justice is one of the key Islamic virtues: <i>In all their dealings, Muslims are required to stand firmly for justice even if it be against themselves or their kith and kin: 'O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)."

The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are.

If you are righteous, He surely was ever Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). [...](17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_441_EgTulIk] In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void.

The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above).
