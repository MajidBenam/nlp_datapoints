He also conducted many military campaigns including multiple attempts to conquer the Korean Peninsula. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnSui**] His overuse of conscripted corvee labor coupled with natural disasters led to famine, and the dynasty was overthrown by massive peasant rebellions and revolts by nobles after only 37 years of rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnSui**] Sui construction of infrastructure and government reforms paved the way for the lasting rule of the Tang.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnSui**][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Sui territory encompassed 3 million square kilometers in 581.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnSui**] The 2,500 km (5,000 li) Grand Canal supplied the Sui capitals of Luoyang, Chang’an and Jiangdu with grain from the lower Yangtze area, running from the eastern capital of Luoyang to present-day Beijing and Hangzhou.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnSui**] The Sui sphere of influence reached Chinese Turkestan, Champa, and Formosa.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnSui**][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Sui’s administrative reforms abolished all fiefdoms and set up a prefecture system.

At best, we can infer that descriptions of this ritual as it was performed during the Tang dynasty may have roughly corresponded to the way it was performed during the Sui dynasty as well: "(1) Observance of the seclusion regulations. The emperor observes seven days of seclusion (mal) prior to the sacrifice. [...] "(2) Establishment of the ritual positions. Three days before the ceremony, positions for an the participants and invited spectators, as well as for the ritual vessels, sacrificial victims, and other paraphernalia are marked out at the altar site. [...] "(3) Inspection of the sacrificial victims and vessels. [...] On the day of the sacrifice, before dawn, the sacrificial victims are slaughtered; the hide and blood of the animals are used to fill dishes that later will be placed before the spirit-thrones of the gods on the altar, and the flesh of the animals is cooked. "(4) The imperial carriage leaves the palace. At dawn the emperor is escorted by his officials, amidst panoply and music, from the T'ai-chi Hall to the detached palace at the site of the round altar. The detached palace is the scene of the emperor's last day of strict seclusion prior to performing the sacrifice to Heaven. After arriving at the detached palace, the emperor meets in audience with his civil and military officials, who afterward return to the imperial palace. "(5) Presentation of jade and silk. Before dawn on the day of the sacrifice, the ritual officers place offerings of jade and silk in round baskets and food in various vessels. They are then carried to the round altar, which is now swept clean. Musicians, dancers, presiding ritual officers, and spectators all take their places. Shortly before dawn, the emperor is borne by palanquin out of the detached palace. He mounts his carriage of state and is escorted as far as the great canopy, to which he is again borne by palanquin, and where he rests. Precisely at dawn the emperor changes his robe to one traditionally worn by rulers sacrificing to Heaven, and is led into the inner precincts of the altar. Emperor, participants, and spectators all make double obeisances toward the spirit-thrones of Hao-t'ien shang-ti and the <i>p'ei</i>, Kao-tsu. The ritual officials then kneel and remove the jade and silk offerings from their baskets. The emperor mounts the altar by the southern stairs and faces north, as subject, now, not as sovereign. Receiving the jade and silk, he kneels and places them at the spirit-throne of Hao-t'ien shang-ti. The emperor prostrates himself, rises, and is led to the spirit-throne of the associated ancestral deity, Kao-tsu, where, facing east, he makes another offering of silk. He then descends the altar. "(6) Offerings of cooked food. As the emperor had been making his offerings of jade and silk, ritual officers had brought trays of food consecrated to Hao-t'ien shang-ti to the outer precincts of the altar. They are now brought to the various staircases of the altar proper. The dishes of skin and blood from the sacrificial animals are taken up to the top tier and placed before the spirit-throne of Hao-t'ien shang-ti. The emperor is led to a washstand, where he laves his hands and the ritual winecup and dries them carefully. He then mounts the altar via the southern staircase. A ritual officer ladles wine into the winecup, and the emperor is led to Hao-t'ien shang-ti's spirit-throne. Facing north, he kneels and places the winecup down before the spirit-throne. An officer now intones the sacrificial prayer in which the emperor refers to himself as "Your Subject, X, who has succeeded to the position Son of Heaven". The emperor makes a similar offering of wine before the spirit-throne of the associated ancestral deity, while another prayer is intoned, this time referring to the emperor as the p'ei's such-and-such generation descendant, "Emperor and Subject, X". After performing a double obeisance, the emperor is again led to Hao-t'ien shang-ti's spirit-throne and handed the ritual winecup. Kneeling before the spirit-throne, the emperor sacrifices the wine, sipping it. He replaces the winecup, prostrates himself, and rises. The trays containing the sacrificial flesh are now brought in and given to the emperor, who hands them in turn to his attendants. The emperor kneels, takes up the winecup again, and drains the wine. He prostrates himself, rises, makes a double obeisance, and descends the altar. Secondary (<i>ya-hsien</i>) and tertiary offerings (<i>chung-hsien</i>) are made to Hao-t'ien shang-ti and the associated ancestral deity by other ritual participants, and the more minor deities on and around the round altar are also sacrificed to. "Afterward, the emperor is led to the station for 'observing the fire.' where he assumes his customary place facing south. Ritual officers approach the spirit-thrones on the round altar with baskets, removing the jade and silk offerings and the prayer-tablets. They take these, along with the dishes containing the sacrificial flesh, millet, glutinous rice, and the ritual wine and descend the altar via different staircases, proceeding to yet another altar constructed of firewood. All the articles removed from the round altar are placed on the firewood. The wood is ignited, and when it is half-consumed by the fire the ceremony is pronounced completed. The emperor is now led back to his great canopy. "(7) Return of the imperial carriage to the palace."

The chief sacrificer had to purify himself in advance through abstinence of varying duration. At the appointed time, he would enter the consecrated ancestral shrine, bow, prostrate himself, and make offerings of food and wine. He was assisted by a variety of attendants, including those who prepared the food, took charge of the utensils, performed divinations, and pronounced prayers. During major sacrifices, one boy or man, preferably a son of the chief sacrificer, would act as a vessel for the spirit of the ancestors. This impersonator also needed to undergo purification before the rite.

Such rites [...] could be performed in a number of circumstances, including forming alliances, resolving conflicts, or determining guilt, with the gods serving not only as witnesses to these rituals, but also as potential punitive agents should the participants fail to keep their word (Lewis 1990; see also Liu 1998; ter Haar 1998: 163, 178, 181). [...] The participants in such rites first purified themselves through fasting. After the composition of a written agreement (<i>zaishu</i>), the killing of an animal victim (referred to as <i>shen</i>) took place at an altar, following which its left ear was placed in one vessel and its blood in another. Blood was then sprinkled on the altar as a means of summoning the gods or ancestors, following which the text of the covenant was read. Each of the participants in the covenant then drank some of the victim's blood, or in other cases smeared the blood on his lips (<i>shaxue</i>). One copy of the covenant was buried in a pit (<i>keng</i>) containing the corpse of the animal victim, while the parties to the ritual also ratified their alliance (<i>limeng</i>). Another copy of the covenant was stored in an archive (<i>mengfu</i>) (Dobson 1968: 271-272). Dobson also cites the use of human blood, including in oaths between lovers to take care of illegitimate children (<i>ibid.</i>: 272-273, 278). "Blood covenants invariably included a contingent curse on those who violated their terms in the form of a 'malediction' (<i>zu</i>). [...] One passage in the <i>Zuozhuan</i> describing a covenant rite performed in 562 BCE contains the following malediction: 'If anyone violates these commands, may the guardians of reverence and covenants, the spirits of the great mountains and rivers, the collected heavenly spirits and spirits who receive sacrifice, the former kings and lords, and the ancestors of the seven surnames and twelve states destroy him so that his people desert him, he loses rank and clan, and his state and family are extinguished.'

One of the most detailed accounts of such rites may be found in the <i>Suishu</i>. According to this text, the rites began with a blood covenant, with the blood and hair of the victim (usually an ox) being smeared on the army's drums. In some cases, the victim's ear would be cut off; in others, the participants (including, occasionally, the emperor himself) would daub their lips with its blood (<i>shaxue</i>) (<i>Suishu</i>, 8.159; see also Graff 2000: 99-101).

Taoism, for example, cannot be fully understood outside the context of Buddhism and Confucianism, on the one hand, and the popular tradition, on the other. A good way to conceptualize the situation is the adapt a metaphor introduced by Eric Zurcher, according to which Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism can be pictured as three pyramid-shaped peaks sharing a common mountain base. As the peaks arise out of the same pass of undifferentiated ‘popular’ practice and belief, they begin to take form as discernable traditions. This metaphor should not be construed to mean that the high traditions developed out of popular tradition- the vertical interaction was complex and went both up and down. The higher the peaks rise, the more clearly they are differentiated from the other peaks and as their ranks narrow into a professional literate elite. Conversely, as one descends the peaks, the more they merge into the area of popular religious practice that cannot be clearly labeled as Buddhist, Taoist or Confucian.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_618_CnSui**][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Daoism only became a unified state imperial religion in the Sui and early Tang. At the end of the period of division (220-589), the state recognized the “Three Teachings”- Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism as equally important. They used the three teachings to form a united front against shamanism. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_619_CnSui**][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Sui dynasty (581-618 CE) reunified China for the first time in centuries, and its first emperor and empress were strong supporters of Buddhism.

Just which of them were available at the early period (before the T'ang dynasty) in Chinese translation is a subject for another investigation, but there is no doubt that they were fairly numerous. And in any case, aside from the question as to whether a particular sutra would have been known outside of the professional religious community, it seems safe to assume that one of the most effective themes of Buddhist evangelism among the lay people would have been the punishment of evil in purgatory-however literally or psychologically that purgatory was taken. [...] It must be admitted that the Chinese hardly contributed anything to the structure or the punishments of purgatory, but simply took over literally the ideas that had arrived from India."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_700_CnSui**] <i>The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2).

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_717_CnSui**] <i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_718_CnSui**]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_739_CnSui**] In Daoism: “From the very beginning of the written tradition of Taoism, there existed a close relation between it and Chinese military and practice. The ‘’Daode jing’’ contains passages that propounded ideas about the nature of warfare (that weapons are inauspicious implements; desolation follows an army) and the proper way for the ruler to engage in combat (conquer strength by manifesting weakness; do not value victory; do not attempt to dominate the world by force of arms) that were immensely influential in later times. [...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_740_CnSui**] Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_758_CnSui**]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Guarantee stability of coin value ♣ absent ♥</b> "At the beginning of the Sui, lack of uniform standards was the most conspicuous problem of the monetary system. Three types of Northern Zhou coins—yongtong wanguo , wuxing dabu (large spade), and wuzhu —and coins of Northern Qi mintage were in circulation. Wendi then created his own standard currency, which, lettered with the characters wuzhu on its face, is referred to in history as the Sui wuzhu. This was followed by a series of edicts aimed at phasing out coinages of pre-Sui vintage. By 585, these efforts began to pay off and the monetary system was standardized. As the top Sui leader in the South, Yangdi was ordered by his father to set up five furnaces to manufacture coins in Yangzhou. Aware of the inadequate money supply in the South, he requested that furnaces be set up at copper mines in E Prefecture (with its seat in Wuchang, Hubei). At that time, Yangdi was familiar with the process of coin production, and understood its significance to the economy. But as emperor, he soon lost control of the government’s monopoly on mintage. As private minting became rampant, the weight of the coin deteriorated noticeably. The standard weight of 1,000 cash declined under Yangdi from 4 jin 2 liang (pre-607) or 2,756 grams,3 first to 2 jin (post-607) or 445 grams, then to 1 jin (post-607) or 223 grams—less than one twelfth of the standard. Coins made of sheet iron, leather, and paper were in circulation. The deterioration of numismatic standards in weight and metal content is a telltale sign of a weakened economy and this was clearly the case in Yangdi’s reign. The debasement of coins that started in late-Sui times, compounded by the rise in commodity values, resulted in runaway inflation that continued well into Early Tang times."
