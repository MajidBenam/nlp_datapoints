whether blood brotherhood rituals were performed by the inhabitants of this polity. However, in the fifth century BCE, Herodotus says they were performed by the Scythians [MAJIDBENAM_REF_145_MnRourn] (typically the first people mentioned in histories of Central Eurasia, even though they never reached as far as our NGA), we know that the Khitan performed them in the tenth century at least [MAJIDBENAM_REF_146_MnRourn], and we know that the Mongols performed them in subsequent centuries [MAJIDBENAM_REF_147_MnRourn]. This suggests continuity between the Scythians, Khitan and Mongols, which in turn suggests that the blood brotherhood ritual was probably performed by peoples that inhabited Central Eurasia after the Scythians and before the Khitan - and these people may well have included the Xiungnu. "Herodotus also tells us that the Scythians give each other sworn pledges by pouring their blood, mixed with wine, into a bowl in which they dip a sword, arrows, an axe and a javelin before drinking from it. We may note that the use of arrows in making a 'blood-brother' agreement is evidenced in the case of Genghis Khan and also in East (or Chinese) Turkistan (now Sinkiang or Xinjiang in north-west China): there, as generally among the Turks and Mongols, the weapons represent the souls of men themselves." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_148_MnRourn] "Arrows (along with bows, saddles, horses, and gowns) also figure in ritual exchanges made between two men who agree to be blood-brothers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_149_MnRourn]. "Found in many Turco-Mongol nomadic societies, the ritual of blood brotherhood involved drinking from a cup into which blood from both parties had been poured. The 'brothers' would then exchange gifts and usually spend some time living in the same YURT, or <i>ger</i>. Blood brotherhood formed an important way of cementing political alliances."

As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b>  The name of the research assistant or associate who coded the data.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_189_MnRourn] This appears to be all that is known about Rouran before the advent of Buddhism around 500 CE, and non-Buddhist elements after this date: "The Juan-juan evidently had female shamans. According to the Chinese sources one of their rulers became devoted to a shamaness who pretended that his youngest brother had been taken up to heaven and claimed that she had the power to bring him down. A tent was erected beside a lake and the shamaness offered a sacrifice to the spirit of Heaven. The prince reappeared in the tent and declared that he had indeed been staying in the sky. Along with venerating the sky, the Juan-juan fired arrows at it during thunderstorms. Otherwise we know only of their funerary rites. They buried their dead in a sitting position: Roux thinks that this means a foetal one, as often in the world, symbolizing a new gestation. The grave was left open while mourners rose round it 100 times."

Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves.

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_237_MnRourn] “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_238_MnRourn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of fairness ♣ unknown: 300-499Ce; present: 500-551CE ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_239_MnRourn]  “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_248_MnRourn] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_249_MnRourn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ unknown: 300-499Ce; present: 500-551CE ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another.
