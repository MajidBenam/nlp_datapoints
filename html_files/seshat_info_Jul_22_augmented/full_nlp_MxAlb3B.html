A mixture of internal and external reasons for this decline are suggested, and has been summed up by Flannery and Marcus: ‘...without the ever-present competitive threat of Teotihuacan, there was one less reason to support what already had become a maladaptive concentration of population on an unproductive 400-m mountaintop.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxAlb3B] Unfortunately, detailed chronological data from this period is not present as the ceramic sequences of the IIIB and IV phases are very difficult to differentiate and radiocarbon dates have yet to refine the sequence.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxAlb3B]The IIIb and IV phases have therefore been combined as one phase on this page. During this phase the population which had previously occupied the capital dispersed into smaller settlements throughout the valley and the valley became occupied by a series of militaristic ‘city states,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxAlb3B] which lasted until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxAlb3B][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population and political organization[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As the Zapotec state was in a process of fragmentation into smaller polities, the actual extent of any polity in the Valley of Oaxaca is very difficult to determine for this period. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxAlb3B][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MxAlb3B] Although the polity was politically fragmented, nobles continued to occupy hereditary positions of power, which were legitimated through their relationship with their ancestors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MxAlb3B] Nobles continued to have control over and exclusive access to  resources and exercised rights not available to commoners “Members of ruling houses, for example, had the right to engage in warfare, take captives, play the ballgame, and offer human sacrifices.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MxAlb3B][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The overall population of the valley grew during this period, although people were no longer unified under one polity. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MxAlb3B] The population of the whole valley has been  estimated at 90,000-200,000 people.

The archaeological data indicate that much of this architectural complexity was in existence by Monte Alban II (100 B.C. through A.D. 200). Many of these buildings do not appear to have been residential and most likely served an array of religious (e.g., the various structures associated with two-room temples), military (such as Building J and perhaps the Ballcourt), and other "administrative" functions (including a variety of other public/institutional buildings the functions of which are still unclear). At the same time, it is probably also appropriate to consider the quihuitao (royal palace) to be another example of a public/institutional building. Both the main candidate for a quihuitao at Monte Alban (the Patio Hundido complex, according to Flannery) and also the example recently excavated at El Palenque (which was probably the capital of a rival independent state polity in Late Formative times) near San Martin Tilcajete (see Spencer and Redmond 2004 in Lat Am Antiq, and Redmond and Spencer 2017 PNAS) were not associated with tombs like other elite (and non-elite) residences; also, both examples had "residential" as well as "ceremonial/governmental" components. Note that the El Palenque quihuitao is securely dated to the Late Monte Albán I phase (300-100 B.C.)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_MxAlb3B]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MxAlb3B&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Law">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_MxAlb3B]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_MxAlb3B]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_MxAlb3B]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_MxAlb3B]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MxAlb3B&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Specialized Buildings: polity owned">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Communal buildings ♣ present ♥</b> Some of the larger (and middle) sites have evidence for plazas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_MxAlb3B]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Special purpose house ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for special purpose houses during this period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_MxAlb3B]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Utilitarian public buildings ♣ present ♥</b> "Markets clearly have a long history in Mesoamerica before Aztec times.

Nobles are shown in elaborate attire, sometimes dressed as jaguars, richly ornamented and often shown in the act of dominating captives, performing human sacrifice, marrying, or communicating with ancestors." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_680_MxAlb3B] "To summarize, imagery on tomb art and carved-stone monuments shows how Classic-period political authority was more exclusionary and less communal than during the Formative (A. Joyce 2004:207- 11; Urcid 2005:154- 5). Genealogy became a key element of ideologies that legitimated the social position of corporate groups as well as rulers. Using Giddens’ (1979:193- 5) framework for understanding how ideology creates, maintains, and justifies sectional interests, genealogy can be seen as having reified status distinctions among corporate groups since the prominence of apical ancestors was fixed. The imagery presented apical ancestors of noble groups as instrumental in the cosmic creation and their continued propitiation was crucial to world-centering rituals. This belief universalized the social position of the nobility by making nobles intermediaries between commoners and the divine, since nobles were both descended from and had privileged access to important ancestors. Wealth and status was further reified since rights to property, privileges, and special offices were held via membership in the corporate group. Members of ruling houses, for example, had the right to engage in warfare, take captives, play the ballgame, and offer human sacrifices. Status within the group was further reified as a function of a person’s proximity to the apical ancestor. Indications that important offices could be inherited, such as that of rainmaker and paramount sacrificer, suggest the means through which other nobles as well as commoners could be excluded from positions of power." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_681_MxAlb3B] "Commoners were increasingly excluded from the plaza. I suspect that largescale public ceremonies in the Main Plaza were less frequent, and when carried out the presence of elite residences acted as constant reminders of the control of the plaza by the nobility." ref&gt;Joyce, A.A. 2009. <i>Peoples of America&nbsp;: Mixtecs, Zapotecs, and Chatinos: Ancient Peoples of Southern Mexico</i> p. 219. Hoboken, GB: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no evidence could be found that this value was actually enforced.
