The issue of ancient Mali's capital has thus been a matter of much debate - and is as yet unresolved. There is currently general agreement among historians that Mali's first centre(s) of power would have been located in the so-called 'Pays Manding', c.200km south-east of Sorotomo.

Although Ibn Battuta and Ibn Khaldûn maintain that this founding hero was converted to Islam, the Malinke oral tradition vehemently insists on his character as a 'pagan' magician and denies any conversion. But already Sundiata's son and successor Mansa Uli performed the pilgrimage during the reign of the Mamluk sultan, Baybars (658/1260-676/1277). Under his rule Mali expanded over the Sahel and took control of the trading towns of Waläta, Timbuktu and Gao, thus coming into a more direct contact with Islamized peoples than in the centuries before. From his reign onwards the royal pilgrimage became a permanent tradition among the mansas. The Islamic outlook of the empire took shape in the eighth/fourteenth century under Mansa Musa (c. 712/1312-738/1337) and his brother Mansa Sulaymän (f. 738/1341-761/1360) who encouraged the building of mosques and the development of Islamic learning. Ibn Battuta, an eye-witness, praised the zeal of the Malian Muslims in memorizing the Qoran and in attendance at the public prayers. The general feeling one has in reading his account is that Mali in the mid-eighth/fourteenth century was a country in which Islam had already taken root and whose inhabitants followed the main Islamic precepts. He does not mention any pagan religious practices and apart from the nakedness of women he did not observe anything prohibited by Islamic law." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MlMali*] However, Niane [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MlMali*] writes that, when traveller Ibn Battuta visited this polity later in the fourteenth century, he noted that " the emperor also remained faithful to certain pagan customs, and Ibn Battuuta was shocked by many unorthodox practices.

The latter's journey, in 1324, is particularly well documented, mostly because Arab chroniclers were struck Mansa Musa's enormous retinue and the large quantities of gold he spent in Egypt. Conrad (2001) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_244_MlMali*] writes that "the <i>mansa</i> was known for his spirit of penitence and devotion, and his pilgrimage was recorded in several Egyptian chronicles as one of the principal events of the year" and that "[i]t seems safe to say that this pilgrimage was similarly important for Mansa Musa's subjects back in Mali", and may have been at the root of legends regarding the region's synchretism between Islam and indigenous religious beliefs and practices. Having reached Mecca, it is likely that the Mali kings' ritual activity was broadly similar to the following description of contemporary practice[MAJIDBENAM_REF_245_MlMali*]: "In the pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj, ancient Arab rites have been taken over and spiritualized. The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba. Furthermore, it is important to remember that almost all reform movements in the fringe areas of the Islamic world were triggered off by the pilgrimage. Faithful believers from Bengal and Nigeria, from Morocco and Central Asia, who had lived for some time in Mecca and exchanged their views with others who, like them, had experienced what seemed to be the 'true Arabic Islam', returned to their Page 39countries to fight the numerous indigenous superstitions and customs which had infiltrated the Islam of the masses and which now appeared to them like remnants of ancient paganism."</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> At Mecca itself [MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_MlMali*].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Mansa Musa undertook the pilgrimage in 1324 [MAJIDBENAM_REF_247_MlMali*], and, generally speaking, Muslims are only expected to visit the Hajj once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_248_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> To witness a royal pilgrimage from Mali to the Hajj would have been a rare occurrence, as suggested by this quote: "Only kings whose authority was well established could be absent for such a long period, and only those whose kingdom prospered could undertake the cost" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_249_MlMali*].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ [12-168] ♥</b> hours.

It is not all certain that thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Mande would have also made offerings to boliw, or power objects, but widely known legends regarding the introduction of boliw rituals to the region links these practices to the time when Islam started to gain ground in the region [MAJIDBENAM_REF_289_MlMali*], which was around the time of the Mali Empire itself. The following is a description of boliw rituals in the twentieth century. "Fabricated by specialists, the most famous of whom live in the regions of Siguiri (Upper Guinea) and Segu (central Mali), Mande power objects are either inherited within the family or purchased by aspiring owners from a craft master at a price that may be quite elevated. In any event, the acquirer pledges to make offerings and to conduct his life in a particular way in relation to the object’s exigencies. Such requirements comprise, on the one hand, specific sacrificial requests—at particular times/spaces and of a particular nature (including substances such as animal blood, cola nuts, and millet beer)—and, on the other hand, more general obligations, usually regulating sexual activity, diet, and social behavior of the owner or <i>tigi</i>. Disobeying these requirements may result in the loss of the object’s power or, worse, in this power turning against the owner. An owner engages with the object chiefly through sacrifices performed both according to the annual cycle and in the time of need. They begin with formal address—a verbal reminder of the alliance uniting him with the object, usually including a thanksgiving for past assistance and a request for future protection. According to my field experience, then, the owner informs the object of his future plans (or of those of the relative, friend, or fellow villager for whom the sacrifice is being performed) to test the object’s view as to the probability of their realization. First the question is asked: “Will the person who promised me money keep the promise?” or “Will I kill some prey today?” The divination with cola nuts or other augurs—such as stones, cowry shells, poultry, or sand—follows, resulting in what is considered to be the object’s answer to the question. The actual sacrificial act functions within this schema either as the closing stage of the consultation or as the fulfillment of former promises made to the object, and always as a reenactment of the alliance between the object(s) and the human(s). [...] Regardless of its exact purpose, the object’s use is secret—i.e., under customary circumstances, one does not show power objects to others or willingly admit to owning them (although their existence is generally a “public secret”), nor does one publicly discuss their properties."

It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_331_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> Every Friday.

Ibn Battuta left an eyewitness account of the 'Id al-Fitr as it was celebrated during the reign of Mansa Musa, in the early fourteenth century: "The people come out, dressed in their best white clothes, to the place of prayer, which is close to the palace of the Sultan. The Sultan came mounted . . . with the <i>qhadi</i>, the <i>khatib</i> [preacher], and the <i>fuquha</i> [jurists] in front of him, calling <i>la illaha illa llah</i> ['There is no God but Allah], and <i>allahu akbar</i> ['Allah is Great']. In front of him were red silken flags. The sultan entered a tent, which had been pitched close to the place of prayer. After the prayer and the sermon had been accomplished, the preacher came down, sat in front of the Sultan, and made a long speech. There was a man, holding a spear in his hand, who explained the preacher's speech to the people in their language. The speech was an admonition and a warning to the people; it praised the Sultan and urged his people to obey him and to fulfil their obligations to him." After this, the Sultan sits on a dais, surrounded by his army officers, his counsellors, and representatives of the Islamic clergy, as his head griot (a sort of musician/bard/entertainer/jester figure) plays music and "sings a song praising the king, an account of his wars and deeds", accompanied, both musically and vocally, by his own several wives and concubines. Once the head griot had finished, lesser griots took the stage, dressed as birds, and recited poetry recounting the Sultan's genealogy, and reminding the Sultan to take on the example of his ancestors. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_368_MlMali*]. From contemporary descriptions of the festival, we can also say that the festival was celebrated once a year, at the end of Ramadan, and that it lasted three days; moreover, among the Empire's Muslims, it would have involved visiting friends and family, sharing food with them, and giving to the poor [MAJIDBENAM_REF_369_MlMali*].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_370_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_371_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_372_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 72 ♥</b> hours.

Societies of mutual support formed by men who had undergone circumcision together were a key institution in the Bamana Empire of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries[MAJIDBENAM_REF_408_MlMali*], and it is possible, and perhaps even likely, that similar societies existed in the Mali Empire as well.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> every three years.

The extent of the government developed by later Songhai Askias can be appreciated in the fact there were more civil chiefs than military ones[MAJIDBENAM_REF_497_MlMali*] so before this period the government was more closely connected to the military. In the Mali state a military aristocracy formed a council which advised the Emperor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_498_MlMali*] Head of government was called "Mansa". The griot was the Emperor's spokesperson.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_499_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]An indirect measure of the state's level of sophistication, by time of king Musa Mali had "enclosed a large part of the Western Sudan within a single system of law and order. He did this so successfully that the Morocaan writer Ibn Babuta, travelling through Mali about twelve years after Musa's death, found 'complete and general safety in the land'".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_500_MlMali*] "Mali ambassadors were established in Morocco, Egypt, and elsewhere"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_501_MlMali*] and might be considered state officials. While we have a reference that says top officials in Niani were mostly "noblemen" from aristocratic families[MAJIDBENAM_REF_502_MlMali*] the learned men around the king might also have been recruited from abroad: new mosques at Gao and Timbuktu and a palace were designed by as-Saheli, one of the 'learned men' Musa brought with him on return from Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_503_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Like the Songhai Empire that came after it the Mali state was run on the resources of slaves tribes and on a system of customs duties and taxation. The ruling family owned slave tribes: they were functionally specialised and tasked to produce crops to feed king's army, fodder for his horses, or grow or farm produce, like fish; other tribes were blacksmiths ("of foreign extraction"); five tribes were obliged to provide "one hundred spears and one hundred arrows per family each year" for the army; from one tribe the king recruited "domestic servants and confidential special emissaries" (but otherwise was exempt from a tax).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_504_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The slave tribes "had all the external appearances of a clan or tribe, as to number, identity of name, and collateral relationships. Yet they totally lacked the social structure and organization of the clan."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_505_MlMali*] We know in reference to the Sonhai Empire plantations worked by slaves were managed by a fanfa (slave-master or ship-master) who might be responsible for 100, 60, 50, 40, or 20 slaves.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_506_MlMali*] A plantation in Dendi had 200 slaves and four fanfas under a leader called Missakulallah, who was also a slave.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_507_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In general terms, the West African states were ruled by a non-landowning who nobility lived on "the institution of a tax, first conceived of as a tithe, a ritual deduction on the wealth of all subjects".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_508_MlMali*] The state gained revenue from taxation on merchants in gold coins or goods[MAJIDBENAM_REF_509_MlMali*] and from customs duties on imports and exports, which had existed from the Ghanaian period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_510_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Was there any court bureaucracy before Songhai?: "It is difficult to realize that, for fifteen hundred years, the Tunkas, Mansas, and Askias simply issued verbal orders and got verbal accounts and reports in return. The customs activities of the border areas, based on what we have just said, would presuppose some kind of precise accounting, just as the payment of taxes and other fees would seem to imply the issuing of receipts, especially to the peripatetic merchants at the markets of Timbuktu, Djenne, etc."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_511_MlMali*] Mali had a monopoly on gold production, especially lands of Wangara and Bambuk.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_512_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]We know that under the Songhai Askias the bureaucracy became very well developed but it is possible more rudimentary aspects of the following description preexisted under the earlier Empires. During the Songhai period, each high official was directly appointed by the king[MAJIDBENAM_REF_513_MlMali*], was given a "distinctive uniform and insignia" which were worn at royal audiences, and they sat together in a highly-formalised assembly.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_514_MlMali*] The king wore a headdress at royal audiences[MAJIDBENAM_REF_515_MlMali*] and his rank obligated him to speak softly so "the Mansa of Mali, like the Askia, and present-day marabouts, all had their heralds who audibly transmitted to the assembly the words of the chief."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_516_MlMali*] Court ceremony very similar throughout Black Africa: for example, covering the head with dust presented a sign of humility.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_517_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Written language was the culture of an urban élite, that did not absorb surrounding cultures and languages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_518_MlMali*] The development of the bureaucracy in the Western Sudan was thus linked to arabic writing and the acceptance of Islamic religion. The oldest example of writing in West Africa is from a 1100 CE tomb inscription at Gao.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_519_MlMali*] "Islam provided the kind of laws that were useful to bigger states and larger market-towns. Such laws were about the administration of justice, the inheritance of property, the improvement of market organization".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_520_MlMali*] In the Western Sudan "the customs of Islam helped towards the formation of regular civil services staffed by 'king's men': by officials, that is, who owed their appointments not to their birth but to individual skill and service to the king."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_521_MlMali*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In addition to Islam, a literate bureaucracy may also have been long encouraged by merchant habits.

The external ones were connected with trade since the function of these empires from the economic point of view was the control and exploitation of the Sudan's trade with North Africa. The ruling class had a real interest in presenting an Islamized front - by the organization of its courts and by performing the pilgrimage - in order to establish and improve good relations with its North African clients and partners. In the internal sphere one of the great problems of the imperial rulers was how to secure the allegiance of other subjected pagan clans and peoples which possessed totally different ancestor and land cults from those of the ruling dynasty. A universal religion such as Islam seemed to offer a suitable solution; an effort was made to implant it at least among the heads of other lineages and clans and to establish a new common religious bond. The increasing extent of the empires made the effective administration of the realm more complicated; in this respect the help of Muslim scribes and other literate persons was indispensable for correspondence and control of state affairs. The influence of Muslim clerics at the courts must have been great, thus preparing the ground for the ultimate conversion of the ruler and his family. "This does not mean that the kings were necessarily very devout or deep Muslims. They also had to reckon with the local customs and traditional beliefs of the majority of their non-Muslim subjects who looked upon the rulers as incarnations of or intermediaries of supranatural powers. None of the rulers had the political power to enforce Islam or Islamic law without compromising the loyalty of the non-Muslims. This helps to explain the numerous pagan rites and ceremonies at the courts of Muslim kings like the mansas of Mali and of the askiyas of Songhay, men who had performed the pilgrimage and were commonly considered to be devout Muslims. "In the Mali empire the Islamization of its rulers occurred at the end of the seventh/thirteenth century under the descendants of Sundiata. Although Ibn Battuta and Ibn Khaldûn maintain that this founding hero was converted to Islam, the Malinke oral tradition vehemently insists on his character as a 'pagan' magician and denies any conversion. But already Sundiata's son and successor Mansa Uli performed the pilgrimage during the reign of the Mamluk sultan, Baybars (658/1260-676/1277). Under his rule Mali expanded over the Sahel and took control of the trading towns of Waläta, Timbuktu and Gao, thus coming into a more direct contact with Islamized peoples than in the centuries before. From his reign onwards the royal pilgrimage became a permanent tradition among the mansas. The Islamic outlook of the empire took shape in the eighth/fourteenth century under Mansa Musa (c. 712/1312-738/1337) and his brother Mansa Sulaymän (f. 738/1341-761/1360) who encouraged the building of mosques and the development of Islamic learning. Ibn Battuta, an eye-witness, praised the zeal of the Malian Muslims in memorizing the Qoran and in attendance at the public prayers. The general feeling one has in reading his account is that Mali in the mid-eighth/fourteenth century was a country in which Islam had already taken root and whose inhabitants followed the main Islamic precepts. H e does not mention any pagan religious practices and apart from the nakedness of women he did not observe anything prohibited by Islamic law." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_729_MlMali*] However, Niane [MAJIDBENAM_REF_730_MlMali*] writes that, when traveller Ibn Battuta visited this polity later in the fourteenth century, he noted that " the emperor also remained faithful to certain pagan customs, and Ibn Battuuta was shocked by many unorthodox practices. Apart from the presence of Arabs and the slight Muslim veneer, what happened at the court of the mansa differed very little from what might have been seen at the courts of non-Muslim kings, for example those of Mossi" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_731_MlMali*]. In contrast with the previous quote, this suggests that using generic Islamic codes is not entirely adequate.

[...] In the history of Islam, the first religious waqf was the mosque of Quba' in Medina. It was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad in 622. Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar. When he asked the Prophet what to do with a palm orchard he acquired in the city of Khaybar, the Prophet said, “If you like, you may hold the property as waqf and give its fruits as charity.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_758_MlMali*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ communal dining ♣ suspected unknown: 1235-1311ce; present: 1312-1410ce ♥</b> “In addition to observing various dietary practices, Muslims use food to celebrate holidays.

Throughout human history, societal violence has been as prevalent as military violence, and in early seventh-century Arabia one finds numerous forms of societal violence. These included, for instance, female infanticide, along with the abuse of orphans, the poor, and marginal. Against such forms of societal violence, the revelations mediated through Muhammad were clear, incontrovertible challenges to the social order of tribal Mecca.

"Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_799_MlMali*] "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_800_MlMali*] "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_801_MlMali*] "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings."

Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)."

If you are righteous, He surely was ever Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). [...](17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_808_MlMali*] In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void. [...] Other needy family members, such as parents, grandparents and grandchildren, may also claim a right to maintenance[...]."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_809_MlMali*]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Griots (high-status, bard-like entertainers) honoured great warriors with songs: "The tune called jfanjon ('glory to the warrior') was composed in honour of Fakoli after his feats on the battlefield; the Tiramaghan fassa celebrates the bravery and warlike deeds of the conqueror of the western provinces of the Mali empire. <i>Duga</i>, an old warrior's chant, is much older than Sundiata and was reserved for the most distinguished warriors of the empire." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_810_MlMali*] The position of Islam on bravery is less clear. "Imam Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ibn Miskawayh (c. 940-1030) regarded justice as one of the 'Ummahat al-fada'il'. In his 'Tahdzhib Al-Akhlaq' he listed 'wisdom' (hikmah), 'courage' (shuja'ah), temperance ('iffa) and 'justice ('adl) as the four cardinal virtues in Islam from which all virtues emanate.//Borrowing heavily from the Greeks, but working well within the established boundaries of the Islamic philosophical tradition, Miskawayh argues that justice, unlike wisdom, courage and temperance, has 'no mean' between two extremes. In other words, it is an absolute value. Wisdome or prudence, on the other hand, is the mean between stupidity and arrogance, while courage is the mean between cowardice and bravado, and temperance being the mean between sloth and gluttony." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_811_MlMali*] However, there are different types of courage, and, in this database, we are particularly interested in "the need to be strong, tough, brave, courageous, or heroic in battle or physical conflicts". In an excerpt from the same book, Bacchus provides this rather broad definition of courage, which may not quite correspond to what Seshat is interested in: "the quality of fury and indignation (al-quwwa al-ghadabiya), which may be described as a form of moral courage, neither rashness or hastiness (yahawwur) nor cowardice (jubn), but a state in the middle of the two. Guided by Kaw and Reason, courage urges man to conduct himself properly, pursue the right or straightforward path (al-siraat-al- Mutaqiim) and avoid the wrong. It also prompts him to be resolute on some occasions and compassionate on others."

Traditional Islamic penal ordinances (hudud) distinguish between two kinds: al-sariqah al-sughra (simple theft), requiring amputation of the right hand, and al-sariqah al-kubra, the meaning of which is contested but which requires the amputation of the right hand and left foot. Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation.
