Of these languages, only Khmer and Mon possess alphabets of their own.The Mons and the Khmers are also the only speakers of Austroasiatic languages to practice settled agri- culture.

proclaimed a 'universal monarch' in a ceremony performed by Sanskrit-speaking priests on a mountain close to the Tonlé Sap lake.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_KhAngkL] By bringing previously independent polities under their control, Jayavarman II and his successors expanded their realm across mainland Southeast Asia, including parts of modern-day Cambodia, Thailand, Laos and

1431.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The reign of Jayavarman VII marked the high point of Angkorean monument-building, and subsequent rulers did not carry out major construction projects at the ancient capital.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_KhAngkL] Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan visited Angkor in the late 13th century and saw temples capped in gold and copper, sumptuous religious festivals, thousands of slaves and servants, and a lively trade in Chinese goods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_KhAngkL] However, this grandeur concealed the fundamental instability of the state, and the

Penh.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Numerous small kingdoms formed in the lower Mekong Basin in the mid-1st millennium CE, but until the conquests of Jayavarman II, most failed to outlive their founders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_KhAngkL] Jayavarman II managed to unify previously warring local lords under his aegis, turning independent polities into provinces and laying the foundations for over six centuries of Khmer rule centred on the Siem Reap plain.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Like many polities in Southeast Asia at the turn of the 1st millennium CE, the new kingdom, with its growing urban centre on the north shore of the Tonlé Sap, borrowed from Indian religious practices, concepts of divine kingship, language, writing and iconography in order to legitimize royal power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_KhAngkL] Its kings patronized both Hindu and Buddhist institutions, building monasteries and sanctuaries dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and the Buddha that doubled as outposts of royal power throughout the realm.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, the Late Angkor period saw a decline in the importance of the Hindu <i>devaraja</i> (god-king) cult, while Theravada Buddhism gained an increasingly stronger foothold among both the people and their rulers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_KhAngkL] This is reflected in the scarcity of Sanskrit inscriptions referencing Hindu gods ‒ the last known Angkor inscription to use this language dates to 1327[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_KhAngkL] ‒ and the increasing importance of Pali scriptures.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_KhAngkL] While some scholars suggest that this religious shift contributed to the loosening of centralized Khmer power,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_KhAngkL] the causes for imperial decline during this period remain a topic of intense scholarly debate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The riches of Angkor at the height of its power had always flowed from wet-rice agriculture,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_KhAngkL] and an institutionalized hierarchy of officials developed to funnel surplus rice produced in villages, as well as other goods like honey, spices, cloth and gold, to the royal centre.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_KhAngkL] Angkor kings also used corvée labour to build temples, irrigation infrastructure and other public works.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_KhAngkL] In this period, however, rice agriculture decreased in importance in favour of trade and commerce, potentially undermining the traditional power base of the Angkor kings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Khmer Empire is famous for its sprawling but low-density urban sites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_KhAngkL] It has been claimed that Angkor itself was the 'largest settlement complex of the preindustrial world':[MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_KhAngkL] at its peak in the 12th century (before this period) it covered 1000 square kilometres and may

So severe was the ensuing fragmentation that by 1340, as noted, at least 23 mainland kingdoms were independent in the sense that they paid no regular tribute to other Southeast Asian rulers (see Figure 1.4).41 Most would survive into the 16th century.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_KhAngkL] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [750,000-1,000,000] ♥</b> Inhabitants.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_KhAngkL] 'With a fluctuating but persistent political dominance that extended from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries, it is hardly surprising that Angkor could built a temple enclosure (Angkor Wat) the size of central Tikal (Figure 11.11) and create a low-density urban complex with a water management network that spread across nearly 1,000 km^2 of intermeshed urban-rural landscape. That landscape could have fed between 300,000 and 750,000 human beings (see Fletcher et al. 2003:117 for assessment by Lustig).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_KhAngkL] 'Angkor. It is now clear that the temple complex was the centre of an enormous dispersed city, home to up to one million inhabitants, making it the largest city of antiquity. '[MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_KhAngkL] 'Although it is likely that Groslier’s original population estimate was too high, Angkor was probably the largest pre-industrial city in the world. The most recent archaeological work indicates that one million is a reasonable estimate of the city’s size.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_KhAngkL] 'Acker has given detailed consideration to the area that could have been irrigated, the water requirement, likely yields, and the location of the barays relative to one another and the land below them. His calculations were based on Groslier’s estimate of a population at Angkor in the vicinity of 1,900,000 people, of whom 600,000 were supported by 86,000 hectares (215,000 acres) of irrigated rice fields. In the dry season, a hectare would require 15,000 cubic meters (525,000 cu. ft.) of water. Assuming all the major barays at Angkor were full to a depth of three meters (9.9 ft.), they could have supplied 7,000 hectares (17,500 acres). If they yielded 1.46 tons of rice per hectare and annual consumption was 220 kilograms (484 lbs.) of rice per capita, the dry season yield would have maintained about 44,500 people, about 2.5 percent of the estimated population. This calculation is based only on the amount of water available when the barays were three meters deep. It does not take into account the possibility that the barays were constantly replenished with water from the Siem Reap River throughout the dry season. There is also the possibility that the reservoirs were used to supplement water supplies to the fields when there was insufficient rainfall during the wet sea- son. If so, then a further 9,000 metric tons (9,900 tons) over and above anticipated wet-season production could have been obtained, making the total irrigated yield 19,200 tons, sufficient to feed nearly 100,000 people.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_KhAngkL] 'At its peak, the population of the impe- rial core may have exceeded 1.5 million.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_KhAngkL] 'At its height, Angkor was the largest premodern settlement in the world, a city of more than 700,000 spread over a larger area than modern Los Angeles. Its crowning achievement was Angkor Wat, built at the kingdom’s height in the early twelfth century. Topped by five towers, arranged in an “X” pattern like the dots on a die, Angkor Wat was designed as a microcosmic representation of Mount Meru, the center of the universe in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology. This vast complex, still the largest religious building in the world, remains a powerful representation of Angkor’s military, artistic, and economic might, as well as the absolute rule of the God Kings, who were said to “eat their kingdom,” ruling with an iron fist.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_KhAngkL]  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ [210-366] ♥</b> in kilometers. 'According to George Groslier, and in the atlas of Lunet de Lajonquiere, there is visible evidence of six major arteries in the system, as follows: [...] Angkor to Phimai, crossing the Dangrek Range: 210 km (130 miles).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_KhAngkL] 'From the capital city, Angkor, there were at least two roads to the east and two to the west. One of the latter ran across the Dangrek Mountains to Phimai, and another went due west toward Sisophon, which means toward the only lowland pass from Cambodia into eastern Thailand in the direc- tion of Lophburi or Ayutthaya.Toward the east, one road has been traced almost to the Mekong, and according to an inscription in which these roads are described, it may have continued as far as the capital of Champa.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_KhAngkL] 'Moreover, given the maximum extent of the Angkorian Empire, at over 350 km from the centre, a single communication may have taken one to two weeks to reach the recipient, rendering administered prices difficult to sustain for extended periods.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_KhAngkL] 'At its zenith, Angkor was to control an empire that stretched from the South China Sea to the Isthmus of Kra and the Andaman Sea, and northwards into what is today Laos. As historians Ian Mabbett and David Chandler have pointed out, many of the subjects of this vast empire lived at remote distances to the capital city; even if they had obtained permission to travel, an elephant journey of only 50 miles from Battambang to Angkor would have taken five days, as it still did in the 19th century.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_KhAngkL] Angkor after the 1400s was probably reduced to the space currently occupied by Cambodia. So the figure may work for the beginning of the Post-Angkor period, but not for the end.

Beyond this distance, there are fewer inscriptions to 350 km, and after that there are almost none.108 The shapes of the curves may also be a function of the pattern of settlement. For example, the dip in the 25-50 km interval may be related to the proximity of the Tonle Sap Lake, the associated swamps and the Kulen Hills, where there are few temples, while at 150 km the Dangrek Mountains could have affected settlement patterns. It may also be partly due to the existence of modern political boundaries and a potential for Khmer sites and inscriptions in Laos, Vietnam and Thailand to be less frequently recorded or published than those inside Cambodia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_KhAngkL] See also Lustig's (2009) six classes of inscription 'density'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] (1) the overall ruler (raja),<div> (2) leaders of regional power bases (terms vary),<div> (3) provincial (visaya) leaders,<div> (4) officials of the settlement (maichiech),<div> (5) village elders (gramavrddha).</div></div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'At any rate, administrative divisions were standardized.

The Sanskrit title of hotar or 'sacrificer' occurs frequently in the texts; this is also supposed to indicate 'royal chaplain' - but the exact scope of the term is unclear since while the royal purohita of the devaraja was a hotar, there were other hotars [Level 3].

The new religion made a huge impact on those exhausted by the worldly demands of their sybaritic rulers. The material world was one full of vanity and one’s best chance of a better reincarnation and eventual ascendance to nirvana lay not with the accumulation of power and wealth, but in renouncing it and dedicating one’s life to good works.

Those outside these age limits were called up for only light labour. Exempt from corvee were the monks, Brahmins, the Brah Van, the mandarins and their servants, and all employees of the king. There was no escaping this core, since all males were inscribed by name on census registers that were revised every three years under supervision of the roving commission.

With this personage, who was not necessarily connected with the client's territory, there were mutual obligations: the client owed the patron deference, and respect, services, occasional labour, and the usual small gifts, while the latter gave aid and protection (even legal) to the freeman and accommodation when he had to travel to the capital.

Inferred continuity from Classic Angkor. </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ court procession ♥</b> 'Nowhere is this more apparent than in the great state processions of South and Southeast Asia, such as the impressive Perahera still celebrated annually in the old Sinhalese capital of Kandy in Sri Lanka (and attended by more than a million citizens). This is what the celebrated reliefs on Angkor Wat's South Gallery are all about: the political, religious and military structure of Suryavarman's empire were laid out for all to see in a  grand and thrilling public display that must have been saved in the parade ground immediately in front of the 300-m (984-ft) long Elephant Terrace. Here is the unforgettable testimony of Zhou Daguan, who actually witnessed such an event: "When the King [Jayavarman VIII] leaves his palace, the procession is headed by the soldiery; then come the flags, the banners, the music. Girls of the palace, three or five hundred in number, gaily dressed, with flowers in their hair and tapers in their hands, are massed together in a separate column. The tapers are lighted even in the broad daylight. Then come other girls holding gold and silver vessels from the palace and a whole galaxy of ornaments, of very special design, the uses of which are strange to me. Then came still more girls, the bodyguard of the palace, holding shields and lances. These, too, were separately aligned. Following them came chariots drawn by goats and horses, all adorned with gold; ministers and princes, mounted on elephants, were preceded by bearers of scarlet parasols, without number. Close behind came the royal wives and concubines, in palanquins and chariots, or mounted on horses or elephants, to whom were signed at least a hundred parasols mottled with gold. Finally the sovereign appeared, standing erect on an elephant and holding in his hand the Sacred Sword. This elephant, his tusks sheathed with gold, was accompanied by bearers of twenty parasols with golden shafts. All around was a bodyguard of elephants, drawn close together, and still more soldiers for complete protection, marching in close order." As for the music, in processions shown on the base reliefs, the Classic marching band was mainly composed of percussion instruments and long trumpets. A passage from a steale in the Ta Prohm complex has an exhortation: "Let the procession that surrounds them be full of banners, parasols; let the struck musical instruments make great sounds that charm the spirit; let the male and female dancers all around here.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_355_KhAngkL] 'Procession of Suryavarman II (S Gallery, W section). In contrast to Angkor Wat's other bas-reliefs, this 94m-long military procession has an historical basis, as it shows King Suryavarman II, the temple's builder, and his army. It begins at the W edge, with two registers: the upper is a royal audience before the army sets off, in the lower a procession. 10m from the start, on the upper register, is the kind, seated (in keeping with his rank, larger than any other figure). Below, princesses and ladies of the court are carried on palanquins. On the other side of the king are his ministers and army commanders, and after the audience they rise and leave, descending steps to rejoin the army. From here to the end, the army marches in a single register, its 20 commanders riding war elephants, their rank identified by the number of parasols and name identified in small inscriptions. The 12th elephant, exactly halfway along the bas-relief, carries the king, again the largest figure, with 15 parasols. The royal standard, a small statue of Vishnu on Garuda, precedes him. Military processions continued just like this throughout the different reigns; the Chinese diplomat from a century and a half later reads, "The ministers and princes are all on elephant back; from afar their innumerable red parasols can be seen... Behind them at last comes the king, standing on the back of an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword." 18m in front of Suryavarman II, the royal sacrificer or Rajahotar, a brahmin, rides in a palanquin among priests, just behind the Sacred Fire on its ark (each end decorated with naga heads). A band precedes this: note the horns, conch shells, flute and a gong carried by two men. The small group of standard bearers just in front is excellent. The head of the procession is taken over by more troops. 8m before the end Prince Jayasimhavarman on an elephant commands a provincial contingent from Louvo (now Lopburi in Central Thailand). Sloping out of step in front of these disciplined troops is a rag-tag body of Siamese mercenaries, wild-looking and armed with spears; their commander also rides an elephant.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_356_KhAngkL] 'I have heard it said that, with previous rulers, the imprints of the wheels of their chariots never left the palace threshold; and that was to prevent untoward incidents. The present monarch is the son-in-law of the previous ruler. At first he was the supreme commander of the troops. On the death of the father-in-law, his [the father-in-law's] daughter stole the golden sword [of state] and brought it to her husband. The true son and heir was deprived of his succession. He plotted to raise troops, but the new ruler heard about it, cut off his toes and kept him in a secrete chamber. A sliver of sacred iron has been inserted in the body of the new ruler, so that he is invulnerable to knives and arrows which may strike his body. Assured of this, the new ruler dares leave his palace. I have spent more than a year in the country, and have seen him go out for or five times. When the sovereign goes out, troops are at the head of the procession. After them come the standard bearers, the flag-bearers, and the musicians. Just the palace women, numbering between three and five hundred, in clothes with floral designs, flowers in their hair, holding candles in their hands, form a battalion. Even in the broad daylight they light their tapers. Then come the palace maidens carrying the gold and silver royal utensils and a whole panoply of ornaments, all very special; I do not know their purpose. Then come the female palace guards holding in their hands lances and shields; they too form a section by themselves. Next come carts drawn by goats and horses, all decorated in gold. The ministers and the princes are all mounted on elephants. In from of them one can see from afar their innumerable red parasols. After them come the kings wives and concubines, in palanquins, chariots, on horseback, and on elephants; they have certainly more than a hundred parasols flecked with gold. Behind them comes the sovereign himself, standing on an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword [of state]. The tusks of the elephants are also sheathed in gold. [Around him] are more than twenty white parasols flecked with gold and with gold handles. Numerous elephants surround him, and there are more troops to protect him. If the sovereign goes to a place nearby, he only uses gold palanquins, carried by palace women. Most frequently, the king on leaving goes to see a small gold tower in which there is a golden Buddha [statue]. Those who see the king must crouch down and touch their heads on the ground; this is what is called the sanba [san-pa]; otherwise, they are seized by the procession organisers who do not let them go for nothing.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_357_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> 'I have spent more than a year in the country, and have seen him go out four or five times.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_358_KhAngkL] While this quote implies that the embarks on these processions approximately every three months, Zhou notes that some of the king's trips out of his palace are not as elaborate or large scale.

This is what the celebrated reliefs on Angkor Wat's South Gallery are all about: the political, religious and military structure of Suryavarman's empire were laid out for all to see in a  grand and thrilling public display that must have been saved in the parade ground immediately in front of the 300-m (984-ft) long Elephant Terrace. Here is the unforgettable testimony of Zhou Daguan, who actually witnessed such an event: "When the King [Jayavarman VIII] leaves his palace, the procession is headed by the soldiery; then come the flags, the banners, the music. Girls of the palace, three or five hundred in number, gaily dressed, with flowers in their hair and tapers in their hands, are massed together in a separate column. The tapers are lighted even in the broad daylight. Then come other girls holding gold and silver vessels from the palace and a whole galaxy of ornaments, of very special design, the uses of which are strange to me. Then came still more girls, the bodyguard of the palace, holding shields and lances. These, too, were separately aligned. Following them came chariots drawn by goats and horses, all adorned with gold; ministers and princes, mounted on elephants, were preceded by bearers of scarlet parasols, without number. Close behind came the royal wives and concubines, in palanquins and chariots, or mounted on horses or elephants, to whom were signed at least a hundred parasols mottled with gold. Finally the sovereign appeared, standing erect on an elephant and holding in his hand the Sacred Sword. This elephant, his tusks sheathed with gold, was accompanied by bearers of twenty parasols with golden shafts. All around was a bodyguard of elephants, drawn close together, and still more soldiers for complete protection, marching in close order." As for the music, in processions shown on the base reliefs, the Classic marching band was mainly composed of percussion instruments and long trumpets. A passage from a steale in the Ta Prohm complex has an exhortation: "Let the procession that surrounds them be full of banners, parasols; let the struck musical instruments make great sounds that charm the spirit; let the male and female dancers all around here.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_535_KhAngkL] 'Procession of Suryavarman II (S Gallery, W section). In contrast to Angkor Wat's other bas-reliefs, this 94m-long military procession has an historical basis, as it shows King Suryavarman II, the temple's builder, and his army. It begins at the W edge, with two registers: the upper is a royal audience before the army sets off, in the lower a procession. 10m from the start, on the upper register, is the kind, seated (in keeping with his rank, larger than any other figure). Below, princesses and ladies of the court are carried on palanquins. On the other side of the king are his ministers and army commanders, and after the audience they rise and leave, descending steps to rejoin the army. From here to the end, the army marches in a single register, its 20 commanders riding war elephants, their rank identified by the number of parasols and name identified in small inscriptions. The 12th elephant, exactly halfway along the bas-relief, carries the king, again the largest figure, with 15 parasols. The royal standard, a small statue of Vishnu on Garuda, precedes him. Military processions continued just like this throughout the different reigns; the Chinese diplomat from a century and a half later reads, "The ministers and princes are all on elephant back; from afar their innumerable red parasols can be seen... Behind them at last comes the king, standing on the back of an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword." 18m in front of Suryavarman II, the royal sacrificer or Rajahotar, a brahmin, rides in a palanquin among priests, just behind the Sacred Fire on its ark (each end decorated with naga heads). A band precedes this: note the horns, conch shells, flute and a gong carried by two men. The small group of standard bearers just in front is excellent. The head of the procession is taken over by more troops. 8m before the end Prince Jayasimhavarman on an elephant commands a provincial contingent from Louvo (now Lopburi in Central Thailand). Sloping out of step in front of these disciplined troops is a rag-tag body of Siamese mercenaries, wild-looking and armed with spears; their commander also rides an elephant.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_536_KhAngkL] 'I have heard it said that, with previous rulers, the imprints of the wheels of their chariots never left the palace threshold; and that was to prevent untoward incidents. The present monarch is the son-in-law of the previous ruler. At first he was the supreme commander of the troops. On the death of the father-in-law, his [the father-in-law's] daughter stole the golden sword [of state] and brought it to her husband. The true son and heir was deprived of his succession. He plotted to raise troops, but the new ruler heard about it, cut off his toes and kept him in a secrete chamber. A sliver of sacred iron has been inserted in the body of the new ruler, so that he is invulnerable to knives and arrows which may strike his body. Assured of this, the new ruler dares leave his palace. I have spent more than a year in the country, and have seen him go out for or five times. When the sovereign goes out, troops are at the head of the procession. After them come the standard bearers, the flag-bearers, and the musicians. Just the palace women, numbering between three and five hundred, in clothes with floral designs, flowers in their hair, holding candles in their hands, form a battalion. Even in the broad daylight they light their tapers. Then come the palace maidens carrying the gold and silver royal utensils and a whole panoply of ornaments, all very special; I do not know their purpose. Then come the female palace guards holding in their hands lances and shields; they too form a section by themselves. Next come carts drawn by goats and horses, all decorated in gold. The ministers and the princes are all mounted on elephants. In from of them one can see from afar their innumerable red parasols. After them come the kings wives and concubines, in palanquins, chariots, on horseback, and on elephants; they have certainly more than a hundred parasols flecked with gold. Behind them comes the sovereign himself, standing on an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword [of state]. The tusks of the elephants are also sheathed in gold. [Around him] are more than twenty white parasols flecked with gold and with gold handles. Numerous elephants surround him, and there are more troops to protect him. If the sovereign goes to a place nearby, he only uses gold palanquins, carried by palace women. Most frequently, the king on leaving goes to see a small gold tower in which there is a golden Buddha [statue]. Those who see the king must crouch down and touch their heads on the ground; this is what is called the sanba [san-pa]; otherwise, they are seized by the procession organisers who do not let them go for nothing.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> 'I have spent more than a year in the country, and have seen him go out four or five times.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_538_KhAngkL] While this quote implies that the embarks on these processions approximately every three months, Zhou notes that some of the king's trips out of his palace are not as elaborate or large scale.

Although in theory kingship was hereditary and monarchs were devarajas, or god-kings, in practice usurpers were common enough, the qualification being that they had to prove they were blood descen- dents of Jayavarman II, the founder of Angkor. It was for this reason that dignitaries and military leaders were required to swear an oath of loyalty to the reigning king, on pain of horrible punishments. One such oath is recorded in an inscription translated by Coedès, and promises eternal punishment in hell if it is broken. As the writers Mabbett and Chandler remarked, although Angkorean society was hier- archical, the fact of usurpation indicates that the rulers were not ‘worshipped as gods and given unquestioning obedience by all their subjects’. The extraordinary security measures described by Zhou Daguan above attest to this.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_627_KhAngkL] '"933 śaka, the ninth day of the crescent moon of Bhadrapada, Sunday.

We will not revere any other sovereign; we will not be hostile to him, we will not comply with his enemies; we will not commit any act which might do him harm.

Name of a seventh-century inscription found at Sabukingking, Palembang, south Sumatra, erected by the ruler of Srivijaya. It was meant to be used in a ceremony in which water was poured over the heads of seven nagas carved at the top of the stone, flowed over the words carved below, and drained into a trough with a spout at the bottom. The inscription says that if anyone drank “im- precation water” and then broke the oath of loyalty the text contains, he would be poisoned by the water of the curse. The practice of “drinking oaths” was common in Southeast Asia until recent times. The inscription reads in part as follows: Om! Success! . . . All of you, as many as you are—sons of kings, . . . chiefs, army commanders, confidants of the king, judges, surveyors of groups of workmen, surveyors of low castes, cutlers, . . . clerks, sculp- tors, naval captains, merchants, . . . and you—washermen of the king and slaves of the king—all of you will be killed by the curse of this im- precation; if you are not faithful to me, you will be killed by the curse. . . . However, if you are submissive, faithful and straight to me and do not commit these crimes, an immaculate tantra will be my recom- pense. You will not be swallowed with your children and wives. . . . [E]ternal peace will be the fruit produced by this curse which is drunk by you. (condensed from a translation by J. G. de Casparis). Other versions of the same oath have been found at Karangber- ahi, far upstream in modern Jambi; at Kota Kapur, Bangka Island; and at two sites in the province of Lampung at the south end of Sumatra.

Kingship was largely hereditary, yet the practice of primogeniture was not always applied. It seems that “election” of a new king by a committee of royal family members, senior officials, and monks probably predates the modern period (Osborne 1973, 169). In the Theravada ideology of kingship the right to rule is a consequence of spiritual maturity. From this perspective, the prerogatives of the king, once appointed, may not easily be challenged by thisworldly considerations, such as political expediency. The king also possesses the power to “master the earth spirits” (Forest 1980, 57). Therefore he may bend the forces of nature to his will. In this way rain will fall at the correct time, good harvests are guaranteed, and calamity is avoided. The king’s possession of a set of powerful fetish weapons, most likely fashioned toward the end of the Angkorian period (Boisselier 1966, 357), reinforced this supernatural authority.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_730_KhAngkL]  'There was a watershed, dated to the year 802, whereby a series of competing polities were joined into one enduring and powerful central state. This transition involved a process of contralization instituted by the overlord Jayavarman II (ruled 802 to 834). Jayavarman seems to have identified a means of unifying formerly competing overlords that was rooted first in military conquest, then by placing his followers in positions of authority. This had the effect of establishing a central rule through replacing independent polities by provinces.

Deification of the ruler, linked with vesting the rights to consecrate a new god-king in successive members of a given family, meant that the succession should be assured.

As the traditional abode of ancestor spirits, mountains were already considered sacred by indigenous tradition. By patronizing the external god Siva, who was known in Indian philosophy as the Lord of the Mountains and for his association with fertility, the kings reinforced their local stature. It remained for Cambodian kings to link themselves ritually with this mountain, the domicile of the ancestors and Siva, and thereby make a profound statement about their ability to guarantee the flow of life-power from the realm of the ancestors—and Siva—to their subjects.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_732_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers control supernatural energy ♣ present ♥</b>  'Since the emergence of Theravada Buddhism as the dominant religious tradition, the Cambodian king has been regarded as “one who has merits” (neak mean bon), a notion connected to the doctrine of karma, which sees present worldly merit as the result of the accumulation of beneficial deeds in previous existences.

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_793_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_794_KhAngkL] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_795_KhAngkL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

At this point, every person would also choose a particular mandarin or even high official in the capital as his patron. With this personage, who was not necessarily connected with the client's territory, there were mutual obligations: the client owed the patron deference, and respect, services, occasional labour, and the usual small gifts, while the latter gave aid and protection (even legal) to the freeman and accommodation when he had to travel to the capital.

The dominant Khmer kinship pattern is one that has confused outsiders for many decades. Because the Brahmin ritual office of Purohita was passed matrilineally from a man to his sister’s son and much was made of this inheritance pattern, some outsiders have assumed that all Khmer kinship was based on matrilineal descent. This idea has not been borne out by research, which clearly indicates no organized kin groupings beyond the nuclear family such as exist in any lineage system; all individuals recognize both their mother’s and father’s relatives equally. Each individual shares rights and responsibilities with a bong p’on or circle of relatives gained through bilateral descent and marriage.

Children born to monastery slaves would generally become slaves in their turn (Leclere 1890, 279). Monks could also become pagoda slaves if found guilty of committing a variety of offenses, including killing and stealing sacred objects. For fornication, adultery, incest, bestiality, administering a drug to bring about an abortion, falsely claiming to have achieved various spiritual powers, plus a number of other heinous offenses, the monk was obliged to become a slave in a royal monastery (Leclere 1890, 241-242).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_854_KhAngkL] 'Slavery flourished in Post-Classic Cambodia, until abolished by the French.

Hereditary slaves seem to have been somewhat fewer, although even the Buddhist pagodas could possess such underfortunates, donated to the monasteries by pious laymen. The reverse could also take place: some the Middle Khmer inscriptions in Angkor Wat describe the manumission of khnum as 'meritorious acts', with individuals or even entire families being freed in this way; this might be conditional, though, for instance committing the former slaves to enter the service of the monastery.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_855_KhAngkL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Extent of punishment (can be more than one):</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ punishment of rulers ♣ absent ♥</b> 'As devarajas, their power surpassed even that of the European monarchs who claimed to rule by divine right.

Zhou Daguan records that every day the king held two audiences, for which no agenda was provided and which could be attended by both ‘functionaries and ordinary people’ for the adjudication of disputes. The inscriptions show that commoners could bring lawsuits against one another and a common method of ascertaining who was in the wrong was to place the plaintiff and the accused in stone towers for a period of three to four days. It was held that the person in the wrong would always develop an illness, such as catarrh, fever or ulcers. The penalties for convicted malefactors were often draconian.
