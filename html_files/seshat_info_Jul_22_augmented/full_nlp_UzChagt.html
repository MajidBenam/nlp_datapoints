With the decline of central leadership, control over the territory and wealth of the Ulus had fallen to them. They provided most of the military manpower of the Ulus, either from their own tribesmen or from the armies of the regions under their control. No one therefore could either become or remain leader of the Ulus wihout the backing of the tribal leaders. Tribal chiefs naturally were not eager to strengthen the position of a central leader; they were intolerant of claims to sovereignty over them,and if a leader displeased them, they were quick to switch their loyalties to a rival candidate. Under these circumstances, central leadership was often contested, sometimes even after a leader had been acclaimed by the tribes of the Ulus."

Only with the ruler Tarmashirin did Islam approach this status, but he only ruled for a handful of years in the 1330s. Overall, it seems most appropriate to code traditional Mongolian customs as the official cult, but they are rather poorly documented, and it is often difficult to distinguish more recent ones from ones that were genuinely followed in this polity. For brief but nuanced summaries of the religious situation, see the below quotes. "Chaghadai was famous as an expert in Mongol rituals and customary law (the jasaq or yasa). His erudition in ritual, especially the  re cult, made him the patron of shamans in later Mongolian folklore. His zealousness in enforcing Mongol norms (sometimes colliding with Muslim ones) earned him an anti-Islamic reputation, although Muslims often adept in magic no less than in Muslim law held important posts in his court. Despite this reputation and several cases of Muslim or Buddhist zealousness, Qaidu and most Chaghadaid khans were tolerant towards the main religions in their realm: Islam, Buddhism and Christianity. Several khans (Du'a, Eljigidei, Changshi, Yesun-Temur) favoured Buddhism, and even after his Islamization Tughluq Temur is said to have asked for a Buddhist teacher from Tibet. Mongolian documents from Turfan, most of which are Buddhist texts, suggest the popularity of Buddhism among the Mongols in this region. Buddhist monasteries were exempted from labour taxes (as was the rule in China) and sometimes also from land and sales taxes. Chaghadai himself was said to have been baptized, and several later khans (Eljigidei, Changshi) showed favour towards Christian missionaries and conducted diplomatic relations with the Pope. "Chaghadaid Islamization was a gradual process, which began in the west and moved eastwards. As in the other Mongol khanates, contact with Muslim elements, mainly in the army and among the local population, as well as Sufi missionary activity were the main stimulators of conversion, though it took longer to root Islam among the yasa-adherent Chaghadaids than among other Mongols in West Asia. Tarmashirin is credited with bringing Islam to Mongol Transoxania, and his pro-Muslim policies certainly contributed to the khanate's Muslim character, although many emirs, several princes and ephemeral khans, and rank-and-file Mongols had embraced Islam before his rise. It took a few more decades before the Sufis established Islam in Moghulistan under Tughluq Temur and his heirs." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_UzChagt] "The ulus of Chaghatay, finally, is typically described as a latecomer to Islamization, and as the Mongol successor state most resistant to the adoption of Islam - in short, as the 'least Muslim' of the three Chinggisid houses that eventually adopted Islam. There are many reasons for this characterization, some of which are historically and religiously justifiable, but there is as much justification, if not more, for recognizing the Chaghatay ulus as the most Muslim of the Mongol successor states. This should hardly be surprising, given the sheer strength of Islam in the urban and sedentary regions of the Chaghatay ulus, and given the prominence, in the Mongol administration of these regions, of native Muslims. The Mongol conquest of Central Asia, after all, was far from a religious 'clash of civilizations' as it is sometimes portrayed. Many local Muslim officials and religious figures cooperated with the Mongols, while the most obstinate opponents of the Mongols were often non-Muslim military forces garrisoned in Central Asian cities, and resented by the local Muslim population, through the imperial will of the Khwarazmshah, whose own policies - both locally, through his dispossession of local Muslim rulers, and internationally, through his challenge to the  Abbasid Caliph - were hardly those of a defender of Islam. "Islam had its defenders, however, in the long-standing centres of Islamic civilization and religious scholarship in the cities of Mawarannahr, parts of Khurasan, and the western and southern parts of the Tarim Basin, all of which were incorporated into the ulus of Chaghatay; by the thirteenth century, moreover, Muslim scholarship had reached well beyond these prominent urban centres, and we hear of jurists of this era from the town of Imil, 'at the furthest reaches of Turkistan', and from Qayaliq (Qayaligh), a town of the Ili Valley in the heart of the Chaghatayid ulus. All these regions provided a substantial Muslim constituency that could and did serve as a vector of Islamization among the nomads as well; this was particularly true in regions, such as Mawarannahr, where local geography favoured the close proximity of nomadic groups to towns and agricultural zones, fostering economic and social ties between the tribesmen and the settled Muslim population. While there were clearly regions of the ulus of Chaghatay that could support a 'purer' nomadism with disdain for the products and other appeals of sedentary culture, the notion of inveterate Chaghatayid hostility towards Islam, rooted in 'nomadic conservatism', is another of the common assumptions that ought to be abandoned.//"Even among the descendants of Chaghatay, Islam and Muslims fared well quite early on. [...] Islam did not again find a significant royal convert and patron in the Chaghatayid realm until the 1330s. [...] The last of Duwa's sons to reign, Tarmashirin, adopted Islam and sought openly to rule as a Muslim monarch (in the early 1330s)[...]. According to al-'Umari, when Tarmashirin commanded his amirs and troops to adopt Islam as he had done, there were some among them who had preceded him in becoming Muslims, and some who responded to his summons and converted; Tarmashirin was assisted, the account adds, by the imams and shaykhs of the country, who took advantage of 'the pliability of the Turk' in their proselytizing, and turned the people of Tarmashirin's realm into 'the most zealous of people in religion'. Though acknowledging that the rulers of the ulus of Chaghatay had been the most stubborn in clinging to the yasa of Chinggis Khan and to the customary rites of the Mongols, al-'Umari affirms again that both the nomadic and sedentary population of this realm had preceded their rulers in adopting Islam early on, and suffered no harm for it 'despite the unbelief of their kings'. While the first part of al-'Umari's latter comment - despite its primarily rhetorical significance, in terms of the contrast al-'Umari sought to make - has been influential in cementing the image of the Chaghatayid realm as hostile to Islam, the rest of this passage is remarkable for its express argument that Islam had spread at the 'grass-roots' level, both widely and deeply, before the 'royal conversion' of Tarmashirin.//"That such Islamization was not as overwhelming as al-'Umari hoped, especially in the eastern parts of the ulus of Chaghatay, is clear from the revolt that ousted Tarmashirin from power in 1334; he was followed by khans from the house of Chaghatay depicted as harshly hostile to Islam, and the tensions between political factions de ned in part on the basis of religious affiliation - only in part, to be sure, but a significant part in terms of mobilizing particular constituencies - may in fact help explain why the political situation in the western part of the Chaghatayid realm collapsed at precisely this point into near chaos, with powerful tribal chieftains propping up Chaghatayid princes and warring among themselves. This situation lasted, in large measure, until the consolidation of power by one such warlord, Timur, during the later 1360s and early 1370s."

The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba.

Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place.

Originally the first day of the Persian solar year, it corresponded with the spring vernal equinox, and the duration of its celebration was six days. Medieval Islamic sources give various (folkloric) explanations for the origins of Nawruz, which involve the mythical Persian Jamshid or the biblical patriarchs Abraham and King Solomon. No Roz was the day to wear new clothes and serve food of the new season. People used to rise early in the morning, go to wells and streams, draw water in vases, and pour it over them- selves or sprinkle it on each other. Explanations for these customs varied, from considering them a good omen and a means to ward off harm to the cleansing of the smoke off of those attending the rituals of the fire of the preceding winter nights. Shi‘i explanation of the significance of Nawruz, which is ascribed to the Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq, sees in it the day of God’s primal covenant with mankind, the day of the first rising of the sun, the day of the defeat of the Antichrist, and the day of a number of other important events."

The scene reminds Muslims of the gathering on the Day of Judgement. If any pilgrim misses this event, his/her Hajj is not valid and has to be done again another year. This does not apply to any other rite, all of which can be done over a longer period or compensated for with an offering. This is the time for the pilgrims to read the Qur’an, glorify God and pray most earnestly for forgiveness and everything else they wish for. Particularly recommended for glorification and repetition is this prayer, ‘There is no God but Allah alone, with no partner. Dominion and praise belong to Him, who gives life and death. Goodness is in His hands and He has power over everything.’ This just gives a succinct summary of the Islamic faith and connects the individual pilgrim to what Ibrahim and Muhammad brought and uttered. Pilgrims normally face towards the Ka‘ba while reciting these prayers, as they do for the five daily prayers, believing that, by doing this, their prayers are more likely to be accepted.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_267_UzChagt]. This ritual is coded here as dysphoric due to the fact that pilgrims are required to stand for several hours (between noon and sunset) under the sun’s heat. A contemporary account, dating to 1997, notes that the “heat is virtually unbearable” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_268_UzChagt]. However, it is worth noting that, due to peculiarities of the Islamic calendar, this ritual may sometimes be performed at a time of the year when the temperature is less hot than at other times, and when there are fewer others between noon and sunset than at other times. Moreover, a few informal online sources suggest that those who cannot stand in the sun for the duration of the ritual are allowed to be in the shade and/or sit down. Still, though relatively mild, this appears to be the most dysphoric ritual within Sunni Islam.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar [MAJIDBENAM_REF_269_UzChagt].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_270_UzChagt]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 6 ♥</b> hours, on average.

However, the fact that no source could be found that even ‘’mentions’’ human sacrifice in connection with Islam (beyond the occasional lurid, and dubious, tabloid headline), combined with the fact that a lot of information is available on the beliefs and practices underlining this religion, strongly suggests that human sacrifice is not part of the Islamic ritual repertoire. ““Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2;. In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice.

Only with the ruler Tarmashirin did Islam approach this status, but he only ruled for a handful of years in the 1330s. Overall, it seems most appropriate to code traditional Mongolian customs as the official cult, but they are rather poorly documented, and it is often difficult to distinguish more recent ones from ones that were genuinely followed in this polity. For brief but nuanced summaries of the religious situation, see the below quotes. "Chaghadai was famous as an expert in Mongol rituals and customary law (the jasaq or yasa). His erudition in ritual, especially the  re cult, made him the patron of shamans in later Mongolian folklore. His zealousness in enforcing Mongol norms (sometimes colliding with Muslim ones) earned him an anti-Islamic reputation, although Muslims often adept in magic no less than in Muslim law held important posts in his court. Despite this reputation and several cases of Muslim or Buddhist zealousness, Qaidu and most Chaghadaid khans were tolerant towards the main religions in their realm: Islam, Buddhism and Christianity. Several khans (Du'a, Eljigidei, Changshi, Yesun-Temur) favoured Buddhism, and even after his Islamization Tughluq Temur is said to have asked for a Buddhist teacher from Tibet. Mongolian documents from Turfan, most of which are Buddhist texts, suggest the popularity of Buddhism among the Mongols in this region. Buddhist monasteries were exempted from labour taxes (as was the rule in China) and sometimes also from land and sales taxes. Chaghadai himself was said to have been baptized, and several later khans (Eljigidei, Changshi) showed favour towards Christian missionaries and conducted diplomatic relations with the Pope. "Chaghadaid Islamization was a gradual process, which began in the west and moved eastwards. As in the other Mongol khanates, contact with Muslim elements, mainly in the army and among the local population, as well as Sufi missionary activity were the main stimulators of conversion, though it took longer to root Islam among the yasa-adherent Chaghadaids than among other Mongols in West Asia. Tarmashirin is credited with bringing Islam to Mongol Transoxania, and his pro-Muslim policies certainly contributed to the khanate's Muslim character, although many emirs, several princes and ephemeral khans, and rank-and-file Mongols had embraced Islam before his rise. It took a few more decades before the Sufis established Islam in Moghulistan under Tughluq Temur and his heirs." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_311_UzChagt] "The ulus of Chaghatay, finally, is typically described as a latecomer to Islamization, and as the Mongol successor state most resistant to the adoption of Islam - in short, as the 'least Muslim' of the three Chinggisid houses that eventually adopted Islam. There are many reasons for this characterization, some of which are historically and religiously justifiable, but there is as much justi cation, if not more, for recognizing the Chaghatay ulus as the most Muslim of the Mongol successor states. This should hardly be surprising, given the sheer strength of Islam in the urban and sedentary regions of the Chaghatay ulus, and given the prominence, in the Mongol administration of these regions, of native Muslims. The Mongol conquest of Central Asia, after all, was far from a religious 'clash of civilizations' as it is sometimes portrayed. Many local Muslim officials and religious figures cooperated with the Mongols, while the most obstinate opponents of the Mongols were often non-Muslim military forces garrisoned in Central Asian cities, and resented by the local Muslim population, through the imperial will of the Khwarazmshah, whose own policies - both locally, through his dispossession of local Muslim rulers, and internationally, through his challenge to the  Abbasid Caliph - were hardly those of a defender of Islam. "Islam had its defenders, however, in the long-standing centres of Islamic civilization and religious scholarship in the cities of Mawarannahr, parts of Khurasan, and the western and southern parts of the Tarim Basin, all of which were incorporated into the ulus of Chaghatay; by the thirteenth century, moreover, Muslim scholarship had reached well beyond these prominent urban centres, and we hear of jurists of this era from the town of Imil, 'at the furthest reaches of Turkistan', and from Qayaliq (Qayaligh), a town of the Ili Valley in the heart of the Chaghatayid ulus. All these regions provided a substantial Muslim constituency that could and did serve as a vector of Islamization among the nomads as well; this was particularly true in regions, such as Mawarannahr, where local geography favoured the close proximity of nomadic groups to towns and agricultural zones, fostering economic and social ties between the tribesmen and the settled Muslim population. While there were clearly regions of the ulus of Chaghatay that could support a 'purer' nomadism with disdain for the products and other appeals of sedentary culture, the notion of inveterate Chaghatayid hostility towards Islam, rooted in 'nomadic conservatism', is another of the common assumptions that ought to be abandoned.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Even among the descendants of Chaghatay, Islam and Muslims fared well quite early on. [...] Islam did not again find a significant royal convert and patron in the Chaghatayid realm until the 1330s. [...] The last of Duwa's sons to reign, Tarmashirin, adopted Islam and sought openly to rule as a Muslim monarch (in the early 1330s)[...]. According to al-'Umari, when Tarmashirin commanded his amirs and troops to adopt Islam as he had done, there were some among them who had preceded him in becoming Muslims, and some who responded to his summons and converted; Tarmashirin was assisted, the account adds, by the imams and shaykhs of the country, who took advantage of 'the pliability of the Turk' in their proselytizing, and turned the people of Tarmashirin's realm into 'the most zealous of people in religion'. Though acknowledging that the rulers of the ulus of Chaghatay had been the most stubborn in clinging to the yasa of Chinggis Khan and to the customary rites of the Mongols, al-'Umari affirms again that both the nomadic and sedentary population of this realm had preceded their rulers in adopting Islam early on, and suffered no harm for it 'despite the unbelief of their kings'. While the first part of al-'Umari's latter comment - despite its primarily rhetorical significance, in terms of the contrast al-'Umari sought to make - has been influential in cementing the image of the Chaghatayid realm as hostile to Islam, the rest of this passage is remarkable for its express argument that Islam had spread at the 'grass-roots' level, both widely and deeply, before the 'royal conversion' of Tarmashirin.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"That such Islamization was not as overwhelming as al-'Umari hoped, especially in the eastern parts of the ulus of Chaghatay, is clear from the revolt that ousted Tarmashirin from power in 1334; he was followed by khans from the house of Chaghatay depicted as harshly hostile to Islam, and the tensions between political factions de ned in part on the basis of religious affiliation - only in part, to be sure, but a significant part in terms of mobilizing particular constituencies - may in fact help explain why the political situation in the western part of the Chaghatayid realm collapsed at precisely this point into near chaos, with powerful tribal chieftains propping up Chaghatayid princes and warring among themselves. This situation lasted, in large measure, until the consolidation of power by one such warlord, Timur, during the later 1360s and early 1370s."

Until Tarmashirin (1331-34) only marginal princes converted to Islam, and none ruled successfully as a Muslim. The first well-known Muslim khan, Tar- mashirin, was overthrown in part because of his overly close identification with Islamic law as opposed to the jasaq, yet by his time perhaps 50-70 percent of the Baru- las clansmen had Arabic names, generally a sign of Islamization. Despite the many powerful Sufi (Islamic mystic) lodges in Mawarannahr, historical records show relatively little evidence of their influence on the Chaghatay Mongols. While several Muslim khans remon- strated against harassing the peasantry, one famous Mus- lim prince, Yasa’ur, was a notorious practitioner of the nomadic tradition of plunder. Du’a and his sons actively patronized Buddhism. In 1285-90 Du’a supported the ’Bri-gung (modern Zhigung) Monastery in Tibet, sending an otherwise unknown Prince Rinchen against Qubilai in Tibet. Yuan records also show Eljigidei (1327-30) sharing in the Yuan dynasty’s patronage of Buddhist temples. Even Tughlugh- Temür Khan (1347-62), known in Islamic sources as the one who converted the eastern Chaghatay realm to Islam, invited the Tibetan Buddhist INCARNATE LAMA Rol-pa’i rDo-rje (1340-83) of the Karma-pa to his realm." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_318_UzChagt]"“Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2; 8). In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac.
