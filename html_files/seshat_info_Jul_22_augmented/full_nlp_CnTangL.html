Shih Ssu-ming, whose military ability was undoubted, suffered an identical fate and was subsequently murdered by his own son.

The T'ang provinces, 785"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Tang Dynasty is widely considered a cultural and political high point of imperial China. The dynasty was founded by Li Yuan, the Duke of Tang, when the threat of insurrection forced the previous Sui dynasty court to flee from Luoyang, the capital, to Yangzhou. Li Yuan marched to Luoyang and seized the abandoned capital in 618 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnTangL] He became the first emperor of the Tang dynasty (r. 618-626 CE) and is posthumously known as Gaozu. Under the Early Tang Dynasty, the capital was moved from Chang'an to Luoyang.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnTangL] We divide the Dynasty into an Early period (618-763 CE) and Late period (763-907 CE), separated by the decline in imperial authority and instability of experienced by the Tang in the 750s, culminating in the An Lushan rebellion to close out the Early period (755‒763 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Tang Dynasty continued to rule China after the defeat of the An Lushan rebellion (755‒763 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnTangL] However, the government never fully recovered from its impact.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnTangL] Tang border defences were devastated, leading to attacks from outsiders and pirates. The Tang government maintained an often-uneasy alliance with the Uighurs against the Tibetans.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnTangL] In 790, Tibetan forces occupied Chinese land in eastern Turkestan and ended Chinese rule in the region for almost a thousand years.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Late Tang China was marked by conflict, with the occasional brief period of peace. Emperor Xianzong's campaigns against rebel governors in the early 9th century restored almost all of China back to direct rule under the Tang government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnTangL] Xianzong was successful in restoring stability to the Tang Empire and his death was followed by 40 years of peace.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnTangL] Later, Emperor Wuzong persecuted Buddhists and adherents of other non-indigenous religions. His movement reached its height in 845 CE and most monasteries were destroyed, but his successors reversed his anti-Buddhist policies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The dynasty fell in 881 CE after a series of internal rebellions, leading to about a century characterized by the rise of powerful warlords in the south and political turmoil in the north[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnTangL] before another period of Chinese efflorescence under the Northern Song Dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Late Tang Dynasty was marked by tensions between the central government and military garrisons.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnTangL] In 763 CE, two-thirds of the provincial governors were military commanders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CnTangL] Tang emperors attempted to weaken the central bureaucracy by having military governors pay direct tribute instead of taxes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnTangL] The Tang government implemented the two-tax system in 780 CE, which replaced the 'equal land' distribution system of the Early Tang.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnTangL] This system of taxation represented an attempt to weaken military garrison governments and to divert taxation income to the central government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Late Tang central government was marked by the rise of eunuchs. Eunuchs did not hold powerful positions in the Early Tang government, but in the later period the Department of the Inner Palace, staffed by eunuchs, became a powerful governmental authority ‒ more powerful than the emperor's chief ministers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Because the dynasty was marked by almost constant conflict, the population of Late Tang China is difficult to estimate. In 766 CE there were between 40 million and 55 million citizens,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_CnTangL] and in 900 CE there were between 60 million and 80 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_CnTangL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Tang Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Tang_800CE: 763CE-899CE; Tang_900CE: 900CE-907CE ♥</b>  Tang_800CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_CnTangL] Tang_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_CnTangL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  3160315: 763CE-899CE;  3292823: 900CE-907CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Sino-Tibetan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Sinitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Chinese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Daoism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=CnTangL&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 3,600,000: 770 CE; 3,350,000: 780 CE; 3,100,000: 790 CE; 3,243,000: 800 CE; 3,386,000: 810 CE; 3,529,000: 820 CE; 3,671,000: 830 CE; 3,814,000: 840 CE; 3,957,000: 850 CE; 4,100,000: 860 CE; 3,600,000: 870 CE; 3,100,000: 880 CE; 2,600,000: 890 CE; 1,500,000: 900 CE; 800,000: 907 CE ♥</b>  in squared kilometers.

Rather, we have only a detailed plan of the rites as they were supposed to be performed by the emperor or his surrogates during high T'ang, contained in the <i>K'ai-yüan Ii</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_211_CnTangL]. We can, nevertheless, gain a fairly good idea of how an altar rite, such as the round altar sacrifice to Hao-t'ien shang-ti at the time of the winter solstice, might have been performed in the early Tang based on the <i>K'ai-yüan Ii</i> description. According to this source, there were seven major phases of the round altar ritual, which are summarized as follows: "(1) Observance of the seclusion regulations. The emperor observes seven days of seclusion (mal) prior to the sacrifice. [...] "(2) Establishment of the ritual positions. Three days before the ceremony, positions for an the participants and invited spectators, as well as for the ritual vessels, sacrificial victims, and other paraphernalia are marked out at the altar site. [...] "(3) Inspection of the sacrificial victims and vessels. [...] On the day of the sacrifice, before dawn, the sacrificial victims are slaughtered; the hide and blood of the animals are used to fill dishes that later will be placed before the spirit-thrones of the gods on the altar, and the flesh of the animals is cooked. "(4) The imperial carriage leaves the palace. At dawn the emperor is escorted by his officials, amidst panoply and music, from the T'ai-chi Hall to the detached palace at the site of the round altar. The detached palace is the scene of the emperor's last day of strict seclusion prior to performing the sacrifice to Heaven. After arriving at the detached palace, the emperor meets in audience with his civil and military officials, who afterward return to the imperial palace. "(5) Presentation of jade and silk. Before dawn on the day of the sacrifice, the ritual officers place offerings of jade and silk in round baskets and food in various vessels. They are then carried to the round altar, which is now swept clean. Musicians, dancers, presiding ritual officers, and spectators all take their places. Shortly before dawn, the emperor is borne by palanquin out of the detached palace. He mounts his carriage of state and is escorted as far as the great canopy, to which he is again borne by palanquin, and where he rests. Precisely at dawn the emperor changes his robe to one traditionally worn by rulers sacrificing to Heaven, and is led into the inner precincts of the altar. Emperor, participants, and spectators all make double obeisances toward the spirit-thrones of Hao-t'ien shang-ti and the <i>p'ei</i>, Kao-tsu. The ritual officials then kneel and remove the jade and silk offerings from their baskets. The emperor mounts the altar by the southern stairs and faces north, as subject, now, not as sovereign. Receiving the jade and silk, he kneels and places them at the spirit-throne of Hao-t'ien shang-ti. The emperor prostrates himself, rises, and is led to the spirit-throne of the associated ancestral deity, Kao-tsu, where, facing east, he makes another offering of silk. He then descends the altar. "(6) Offerings of cooked food. As the emperor had been making his offerings of jade and silk, ritual officers had brought trays of food consecrated to Hao-t'ien shang-ti to the outer precincts of the altar. They are now brought to the various staircases of the altar proper. The dishes of skin and blood from the sacrificial animals are taken up to the top tier and placed before the spirit-throne of Hao-t'ien shang-ti. The emperor is led to a washstand, where he laves his hands and the ritual winecup and dries them carefully. He then mounts the altar via the southern staircase. A ritual officer ladles wine into the winecup, and the emperor is led to Hao-t'ien shang-ti's spirit-throne. Facing north, he kneels and places the winecup down before the spirit-throne. An officer now intones the sacrificial prayer in which the emperor refers to himself as "Your Subject, X, who has succeeded to the position Son of Heaven". The emperor makes a similar offering of wine before the spirit-throne of the associated ancestral deity, while another prayer is intoned, this time referring to the emperor as the p'ei's such-and-such generation descendant, "Emperor and Subject, X". After performing a double obeisance, the emperor is again led to Hao-t'ien shang-ti's spirit-throne and handed the ritual winecup. Kneeling before the spirit-throne, the emperor sacrifices the wine, sipping it. He replaces the winecup, prostrates himself, and rises. The trays containing the sacrificial flesh are now brought in and given to the emperor, who hands them in turn to his attendants. The emperor kneels, takes up the winecup again, and drains the wine. He prostrates himself, rises, makes a double obeisance, and descends the altar. Secondary (<i>ya-hsien</i>) and tertiary offerings (<i>chung-hsien</i>) are made to Hao-t'ien shang-ti and the associated ancestral deity by other ritual participants, and the more minor deities on and around the round altar are also sacrificed to. "Afterward, the emperor is led to the station for 'observing the fire.' where he assumes his customary place facing south. Ritual officers approach the spirit-thrones on the round altar with baskets, removing the jade and silk offerings and the prayer-tablets. They take these, along with the dishes containing the sacrificial flesh, millet, glutinous rice, and the ritual wine and descend the altar via different staircases, proceeding to yet another altar constructed of firewood. All the articles removed from the round altar are placed on the firewood. The wood is ignited, and when it is half-consumed by the fire the ceremony is pronounced completed. The emperor is now led back to his great canopy. "(7) Return of the imperial carriage to the palace."

Compared to the ancestral sacrifices, then, the altar rites possessed a more "public" character. [...] Political legitimacy in the T'ang had become less dependent on blood relationships than in the Han. T'ang rituals and symbols of legitimation, as we will see in the following chapters, had opened up and out to embrace more "public" objects of worship and more numerous individuals or groups as participants and spectators."

Those in charge of states, fiefs, and families were privileged and obliged to officiate at rites; those not so privileged were expected to assist in whatever capacity was appropriate to them. The chief sacrificer had to purify himself in advance through abstinence of varying duration. At the appointed time, he would enter the consecrated ancestral shrine, bow, prostrate himself, and make offerings of food and wine. He was assisted by a variety of attendants, including those who prepared the food, took charge of the utensils, performed divinations, and pronounced prayers. During major sacrifices, one boy or man, preferably a son of the chief sacrificer, would act as a vessel for the spirit of the ancestors. This impersonator also needed to undergo purification before the rite. During the rite he would drink the wine offered to the ancestors and in trancelike fashion passively allow the spirits to animate him. A ritual expert would interpret the ancestors' wishes, which in the standard liturgy of the <i>I-Ii</i> was to convey blessings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_301_CnTangL] NOTE: It seems more sensible, here, to exclude "major sacrifices" and only consider the simpler types of ancestor worship: it seems reasonable to infer that the latter occurred more frequently than the former. However, it would be quite easy to change a few key variables from "absent" to "present" should it be decided to incorporate the major sacrifices in this ritual--Cho-Yun and Linduff (1988), in particular, offer a detailed description of these rites.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ seasonally ♥</b> These rituals occurred "several times a year" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_302_CnTangL]. 60 day intervals between rituals [MAJIDBENAM_REF_303_CnTangL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ seasonally ♥</b> These rituals occurred "several times a year" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_304_CnTangL]. 60 day intervals between rituals [MAJIDBENAM_REF_305_CnTangL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> These rituals occurred "several times a year" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_306_CnTangL].

specifically the blood covenats of ancient times. Such rites [...] could be performed in a number of circumstances, including forming alliances, resolving conflicts, or determining guilt, with the gods serving not only as witnesses to these rituals, but also as potential punitive agents should the participants fail to keep their word (Lewis 1990; see also Liu 1998; ter Haar 1998: 163, 178, 181). [...] The participants in such rites first purified themselves through fasting. After the composition of a written agreement (<i>zaishu</i>), the killing of an animal victim (referred to as <i>shen</i>) took place at an altar, following which its left ear was placed in one vessel and its blood in another. Blood was then sprinkled on the altar as a means of summoning the gods or ancestors, following which the text of the covenant was read. Each of the participants in the covenant then drank some of the victim's blood, or in other cases smeared the blood on his lips (<i>shaxue</i>). One copy of the covenant was buried in a pit (<i>keng</i>) containing the corpse of the animal victim, while the parties to the ritual also ratified their alliance (<i>limeng</i>). Another copy of the covenant was stored in an archive (<i>mengfu</i>) (Dobson 1968: 271-272). Dobson also cites the use of human blood, including in oaths between lovers to take care of illegitimate children (<i>ibid.</i>: 272-273, 278). "Blood covenants invariably included a contingent curse on those who violated their terms in the form of a 'malediction' (<i>zu</i>). [...] One passage in the <i>Zuozhuan</i> describing a covenant rite performed in 562 BCE contains the following malediction: 'If anyone violates these commands, may the guardians of reverence and covenants, the spirits of the great mountains and rivers, the collected heavenly spirits and spirits who receive sacrifice, the former kings and lords, and the ancestors of the seven surnames and twelve states destroy him so that his people desert him, he loses rank and clan, and his state and family are extinguished.' (Lewis 1990: 47-48)" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_442_CnTangL] "People continued to perform blood covenants in medieval China, including some women warriors of the Tang dynasty who did so before launching an attack on a rebel camp (<i>Xin Tangshu</i>, 205.5826)."

Taoism, for example, cannot be fully understood outside the context of Buddhism and Confucianism, on the one hand, and the popular tradition, on the other. A good way to conceptualize the situation is the adapt a metaphor introduced by Eric Zurcher, according to which Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism can be pictured as three pyramid-shaped peaks sharing a common mountain base. As the peaks arise out of the same pass of undifferentiated ‘popular’ practice and belief, they begin to take form as discernable traditions. This metaphor should not be construed to mean that the high traditions developed out of popular tradition- the vertical interaction was complex and went both up and down. The higher the peaks rise, the more clearly they are differentiated from the other peaks and as their ranks narrow into a professional literate elite. Conversely, as one descends the peaks, the more they merge into the area of popular religious practice that cannot be clearly labeled as Buddhist, Taoist or Confucian.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_637_CnTangL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Daoism only became a unified state imperial religion in the Sui and early Tang. At the end of the period of division (220-589), the state recognized the “Three Teachings”- Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism as equally important. They used the three teachings to form a united front against shamanism.

So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_737_CnTangL] <i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_738_CnTangL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_744_CnTangL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other supernatural enforcement ♣ present ♥</b> Piety.

He said that if one is really loyal, really doing one’s duty, ‘how could you not instruct your ruler?’ As we have seen with filial piety above, criticism is permitted, if done reverently, though the results may be hard on the son or government minister. In a later text, the Book of Ritual, it is noted that a filial son may speak up to criticize his parents three times, but, if ignored, he is to follow their wishes. Similarly, it says, a government minister should speak to his ruler and offer advice and criticism. If after three attempts the ruler continues to ignore the min- ister, the minister should resign.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them.

[...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_760_CnTangL] Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures.
