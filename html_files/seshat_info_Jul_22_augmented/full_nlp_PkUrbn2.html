"The Harappan settlement pattern may offer some clues to the organization of society. The settlements fall basically into three categories. First there are a very few enormous settlements, the cities. These were at least 60 hectares in extent (Dholavira, which may actually be as much as 100 hectares) and could be as large as 250 hectares (Mohenjo-daro).//"At the opposite end of the spectrum were rural settlements: farming villages, pastoralist and hunter-gatherer camps, and fishing villages. These could range in size from less than a hectare to 7 or 8 hectares. Their inhabitants were essentially primary producers of subsistence products who would also have undertaken domestic crafts such as weaving and woodworking. In addition, there were villages whose inhabitants were specialists, such as the shellfishers and shellworkers of Nageshwar.//"The third category, towns, is an amorphous catch-all, including a great diversity of different types of settlement. They were usually quite small, around 1 to 5 hectares, and, though some were larger, few exceeded 16 hectares. This figure does not include the suburbs that may have existed outside many towns; traces of suburban settlement have been reported outside a few and are suspected at others, but none has been properly investigated.//"While towns resembled cities in that they housed officials, traders, and other occupational specialists and probably provided services for the people of their area, the majority were also specialist centers."//"The settlement pattern seems to indicate that both towns and villages were tributary directly to their local domain capital (city), links between them being maintained by pastoralists and via water transport; towns also acted as funnels through which local goods were channeled toward the city."<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

"The power of the Harappan state to mobilize huge workforces is apparent in the construction of the massive platforms on which many of the towns and cities were built. Those at Mohenjo-daro are the most impressive feat: Jansen calculated that the platform underlying the citadel there would have required 300,000-400,000 man-days’ labor to build. Equally impressive were the walls that surrounded many of the urban settlements, freestanding or as revetment for the platforms: These were in some cases more than 15 meters thick and could be as high as 9 meters, and they were furnished with elaborate gateways.//"The sinking of wells was also a substantial undertaking: Mohenjo-daro is thought to have had around seven hundred, created during the foundation phase of the city’s construction. Digging the reservoirs at Dholavira was also a vast project: At least sixteen in number, they together covered about hectares and were excavated down to bedrock or in some areas cut down into it. Soil taken from them was built up into massive bunds (dykes), up to 7 meters wide and faced with masonry, running between the reservoirs. A number of dams were created on the two seasonal streams, running past the settlement to divert water into the reservoirs. In addition to the labor of their original construction, regular work was required to maintain the reservoirs and remove any accumulated silt. While not on the same scale, the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro and the dock at Lothal were also considerable feats of hydraulic engineering.//"The Harappans did not build monumental temples or tombs but these platforms, walls, and basins were similarly vast projects requiring the bringing together, feeding, and management of huge numbers of workers. While the work at Dholavira and Lothal may have been undertaken during the slack period of the agricultural year by the inhabitants of the city and its hinterland over the course of a number of years, the construction of the platforms and walls for the foundation of towns and cities were undertakings that had to be completed before the first houses could be built, and work could take place only during the winter months when the plains were clear of floods.

By focusing on the geometry of design motifs observed commonly in the artifacts excavated from various sites belonging to this culture, we have shown that they suggest a deep understanding of the properties of circular shapes. In particular, designs which exhibit space-filling tiling with complicated shapes imply that the Indus culture may have been adept at accurately estimating the area of shapes enclosed by circular arcs.

However, this expert has never checked EC's work.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The high degree of uniformity characterising the Indus Civilisation has led some to take evidence for one region and apply it to others; and has also led to arguments for political and religious doctrines of uniformity and/or nihilism.  However, more recent debate has highlighted regional differences that have qualified such assumptions.  Nausharo, although located in Baluchistan, seems to be allied strongly to the Sindhi region and thus it is safe to discuss it together with finds from Mohenjo-daro.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The nature of Indus religion has been elusive; and though much has been written on it the fact that John Marshall's description is still the standard work and he put great weight on mother goddess figurines and phallic symbols<sup id="cite_ref-223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-223">[223]</a></sup>.  The main themes seem to be worship of the natural world, particularly the bull, and the use of water in ritual, including bathing.<sup id="cite_ref-224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]One of the main problems is that the script, virtually only found on the seals, has never been translated, despite numerous claims to the contrary<sup id="cite_ref-225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup>Credible evidence and a review of past efforts is in <sup id="cite_ref-226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-226">[226]</a></sup>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The evidence falls mainly into a number of groups.  The first consists of depictions of what could be gods in pictorial art, mainly seals.  The most common seal type is the bull (which may have only one horn) standing over what appears to be a brazier.  This makes up over half of all seals found.  Other scenes include figures associated with a pipal tree (ficus religiosa), which is sacred in Indian religions (including Buddhism) even today<sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup> and whose leaves are a popular design on Harappan pottery.  Given the importance of the sacred tree in later history it is probably safe to assign a similar importance in this period.  Animals such as the tiger and the deer are also popular; and one seal appears to show animal figures on standards in a procession<sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup>. The most famous seal image is that of the Proto-Shiva, a figure in yogic posture who is wearing a bull headdress or is half-man half-bull.  He possibly has three faces; and his other features are an erect phallus and multiple armlets.  He has been interpreted as a shaman, but also as a forerunner of the Hindu god Shiva in the latter's role of Lord of the Beasts (Pashupati); for the seal also includes the tiger and other jungle creatures who surround him.  Although a popular interpretation, it has been fairly rejected by a number of scholars<sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]He could also be a priest, for a seal showing a collective ritual shows him bowing before a horned deity in a pipal tree, with other figures processing below them<sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup>. This and the procession are the two major images of ritual.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The second type of evidence consists of figurines.  These are found more in the south of the Indus (the Greater Indus Valley) than in other regions, where animal figurines are dominant<sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup>. The vast majority of human images are female with elaborate headdresses and jewellery.  They have been interpreted as mother goddesses and fertility figures or as votive figurines; however, it is the men who are naked and with prominent genitals rather than the women<sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup>.

A "dancing girl" of bronze may or may not be involved in ritual.  The "priest-king", interpreted as a theocratic figure, wears a robe decorated with trefoils, which may have some religious significance; but there is no justification for his title<sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup>.

This points to rituals involving bathing<sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup>; and the placement of the Great Bath on the Citadel at Mohenjo-daro, with restricted access, points to some restriction in participation.

However, the following quote does show that anthropomorphic figures confronting large, dangerous animals, as well as wearing items made from large, dangerous animals was a key theme in Harappan iconography. Because in so many other contexts similar iconography has been interpreted as reflecting the performance of ritual animal fights (e.g. at Catal-hoyuk, in Pre-Dynastic Egypt, in early Crete), it seems reasonable to infer, here, that these may also have been performed in Harappan sites. "Bulls and water buffalo played a major role in Harappan iconography. Massive bulls were a popular subject for figurines and were also shown on seals; the presence of cattle bones in the pit associated with a fire altar at Kalibangan and in another at Rakhigarhi indicates that cattle were chosen as sacrificial victims. Headdresses made from the horns of a buffalo or less commonly of a bull were worn by figures that seem to represent deities in mythological scenes on seals and in other contexts. Buffalo horns, often with pendant stars or associated with pipal leaves or flowers, also appeared on pottery from the Early Harappan period onward. A jar from Padri in Gujarat is decorated with a buffalo horn motif and with a large figure in a ragged skirt wearing an enormous pair of buffalo horns. Buffaloes frequently appear in scenes on seals or tablets, often in combat with humans. In some, a figure wrestles one or two animals; in others, a man stands with one foot on the animal’s bowed head and pierces its body with a spear. "Scenes of combat between man and beast also feature tigers. In some, a male or female figure strangles two tigers; in others, a tiger is attacked by an individual with a bull’s head. Some terra-cotta figurines depict tigers or other felines, and tiger stripes are shown on some of the figures identified as deities. In some scenes a stick figure sits in a neem tree, watched by a prowling tiger looking back over its shoulder. The figure balances on the tree branch with its legs in a similar posture to that of the stone sculptures, squatting on the heels with one knee raised; it is slender, wears neither clothes nor jewelry, and is apparently genderless. It seems that bovids and tigers, magnificent and powerful creatures, played a major and balancing role in the iconography of the Indus civilization, both individually and in combination. Both appear in later Indian religion, as vehicles for deities, as manifestations of gods in their more terrible forms, and as their opponents: for example, the goddess Durga riding a tiger and slaying the buffalo demon, Mahishasura. While the buffalo and bull, as well as the unicorn, are depicted as unmistakably male, tigers are not and may perhaps have been female, another significant duality."<sup id="cite_ref-371" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-371">[371]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "The absence of ostentatious buildings and facades says nothing of a priesthood, which may or may not have been present.

Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Limits_on_Power_of_the_Chief_Executive">Limits on Power of the Chief Executive</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=PkUrbn2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47" title="Edit section: Limits on Power of the Chief Executive">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div>These codes refer to an explicit or defined right for some group to constrain the activity of the executive in some way, typically through a legal code, but other ways are imaginable (explain in paragraph if other mechanisms found).

Normative Ideology</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Two contrasting features characterize the Harappan civilization: very marked standardization of many aspects of life and very marked heterogeneity in others, some as fundamental as religious practices. It seems that the people of the Indus civilization, from different backgrounds, often with different beliefs, all subscribed to the overarching ideology of the Harappan state, which must have had a religious component reflected in the cardinal orientation of the settlements and the strong emphasis on water and purification. This was also apparent in the social and economic spheres, where the shared ideology was displayed in aspects of personal appearance, such as ornaments of beads and shell, and in the standardized forms taken by most artifacts, throughout the Harappan realms." <sup id="cite_ref-412" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-412">[412]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Possehl infers that the following four were key aspects of Indus ideology:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"1. The Indus peoples were nihilists who sought to bring a new sociocultural order to the Great Indus region.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"2. Urbanization and city life were a part of this new ideology.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"3. The physical and symbolic aspects of water formed a part of the Indus ideology. M. Jansen calls it <i>wasserluxus</i>, a term I have integrated into my position on Indus ideology.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"4. The Indus ideology promoted technological prowess and innovation.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"[...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The immense differences between the Indus Civilization, as compared to the Early Harappan, can be seen as a replacement of the older Early symbolic system with a new order and way of life. The Indus peoples turned their backs on their own past and replaced it with this, a new order and way of life. Archaeologists see this new order, or ideology, expressed as new signs and symbols such as new artifact styles, architecture, town planning, innovations in technology, and the like.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The changes in settlement location that take place with the Mature Harappan can also be interpreted as an attempt to break with the past: stop living where the old traditions linger, build a new settlement where the new ideology will prosper. This is expressed in the archaeological record as abandoned Early Harappan sites and Indus sites founded on virgin soil. For example, Mohenjo-daro is thought to be a 'founder's city,' a place planned and built on virgin soil. Not all of the large Indus settlements were like this. Harappa, for example, has a very impprtant Early Harappan occupation and a transitional occupation into the Mature Harappan. But there is a proclivity for Indus sites to be founded on virgin soil: 755 out of 1,058 sites, or 71 percent. Of the 523 Early Harappan sites we know of 324 (62 percent) were abandoned prior to the Mature Harappan. This finding documents the observation that the Indus peoples tended to build new settlements, on fresh soil, abandoning their past in the form of the places that were home to their ancestors. The rate for the founding of Indus new settlements is significantly greater than that for the other stages of the Indus Age.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"I think of this kind of behavior as 'nihilistic,' a concept with many connotations. The one used here is as an ideology that espouses great, even revolutionary, change, in a sociocultural system whose past has come to be seen as vacuous, baseless, even corrupt, or perhaps just wrong. Nihilists are those whose attempt to deny their heritage and replace it with a new order, or ideology. This resonates with my strong sense that the Indus Civilization brings with it a sense of originality, something new and fresh.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"{...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The sociocultural complexity of the Indus Civilization is distinctive in two important ways: the absence of temples or other monumental buildings serving the religious institution and the absence of monumental residences for kings and elites of this sort. The Indus ideology did not admit such sociocultural expressions. Just as this ideology inhibited such expressions. Just as this ideology inhibited such expressions, they were promoted in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. [...] I sense in the Indus peoples a marked distrust in government, per se, especially strong, centralized government.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the absence of a strong, centralized religion and religious monuments, the Indus ideology emerges as of prime importance. The ideology lacks firm substance in terms of monumental buildings (gigantic pyramids, ziggurats, temples, etc.) and therefore may have ben more in the mind of the Indus peoples than a physical reality that they gazed upon in awe and fear. Like being a 'good Marxist' was valued in the formed Soviet Union, being a 'good Harappan' may have been what was valued by the peoples of the Indus Civilization. The ideology, like religion in the archaic state, thus emerges as the central force in Indus social control and allegiance." <sup id="cite_ref-413" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-413">[413]</a></sup></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=PkUrbn2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=66" title="Edit section: Deification of Rulers">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "A prominent feature of most civilizations is evidence of the ruling elite: palatial residences, rich burials, unique luxury products, and propaganda such as monumental inscriptions and portrait statuary or reliefs.
