Badarians imported raw materials like wood, turquoise, shells and ivory and exchanged goods with groups from as far away as Palestine, the Red Sea and Syria.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgBadar] Model boats found at the site of Merimda to the north 'suggest that boats and canoes were already in use [in Egypt] before 4500 B.C.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgBadar][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Very little can be concluded about Badarian political and social structure, but analysis of grave goods shows that there was an unequal distribution of wealth, and that the wealthier graves tended to be kept separate within the cemeteries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgBadar] However, no monumental remains have been found so it is likely that higher-status members of society did not command a significant labour force.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Emilia Tomicka; Edward A L Turner ♥</b> <i>these codes were reviewed at at the Seshat Workshop on Egyptian History, Oxford 2014</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgBadar&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ ♥</b> Badarian culture was first identified in the el-Badari region, near Sohag.

Shape of the grave is not clearly defined but it was more or less oval and roofed by the mats[MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_EgBadar][MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_EgBadar]. The body was placed on mats, on their left side, with head oriented South[MAJIDBENAM_REF_91_EgBadar][MAJIDBENAM_REF_92_EgBadar]. There is no evidence of putting effort into preserving the bodies in any way, but the internal organs had always disappeared[MAJIDBENAM_REF_93_EgBadar].There were some differences between graves of males and females. In poorer groups the size was different[MAJIDBENAM_REF_94_EgBadar]. Guy Brunton has said that "the graves which were not sexed were in most cases plundered, and we may therefore conclude that they were richer than the smaller untouched ones[MAJIDBENAM_REF_95_EgBadar]", but according to Trigger, this fact does not necessarily indicate a lack of social stratification[MAJIDBENAM_REF_96_EgBadar].The typical burial kit contained food, and accessories like stone pallets, ivory spoons and vases, all of which appear to have been associated with the grinding and use of green face-paint[MAJIDBENAM_REF_97_EgBadar].Furthermore, there are some suggestions about the possible objects of cult e.g. falcon figurines[MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_EgBadar].</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgBadar&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ competitive feast ♥</b> "The rich resources of the Nile combined with the new domesticates could be effectively and intensively exploited. Ambitious individuals would be able to collect considerable surpluses and organise competitive feasts in order to control labour, loyalties and loans, thus gaining power and prestige (Hakansson 1994; Hayden 2003)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_99_EgBadar] Based on his ethnoarchaeological studies of transegalitarian Southeast Asian societies, Hayden [MAJIDBENAM_REF_100_EgBadar] writes: "Some of the major conclusions that I and my students have developed are that feasts are critical for the conversion of surplus production into social and political ties through the creation of debt relationships and the display of mutual support (Adams 2001; Clarke 2001; Perodie 2001; Hayden 2001a). Feasting relationships are fundamental to structuring power relationships within communities, and have even been described as an institution comparable to parliamentary democracy (Clarke 2001). Typically, support networks and competition between networks operate primarily at the level of lineages or corporate kindreds (such as the tongkonans in the Torajan area), with only a loose correspondence between individual household production and feasting activity. However, in all situations, it is clear that feasting constitutes the single most important consumption activity of surpluses and that there is significant competition to display wealth at the most important feasts.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_EgBadar] Based on his ethnoarchaeological studies of transegalitarian Southeast Asian societies, Hayden [MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_EgBadar] writes: "Some of the major conclusions that I and my students have developed are that feasts are critical for the conversion of surplus production into social and political ties through the creation of debt relationships and the display of mutual support (Adams 2001; Clarke 2001; Perodie 2001; Hayden 2001a). Feasting relationships are fundamental to structuring power relationships within communities, and have even been described as an institution comparable to parliamentary democracy (Clarke 2001). Typically, support networks and competition between networks operate primarily at the level of lineages or corporate kindreds (such as the tongkonans in the Torajan area), with only a loose correspondence between individual household production and feasting activity. However, in all situations, it is clear that feasting constitutes the single most important consumption activity of surpluses and that there is significant competition to display wealth at the most important feasts. Feasts can also be used to underwrite major labour-intensive projects such as house building, irrigation works, planting and harvesting (Dietler and Herbrich 2001; Dietler 1990)."</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ [25-100] ♥</b> "Excavations at the Badarian site of Deir Tasa revealed a settlement covering an area of about 5000 m (Gabra, 1930)" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_126_EgBadar], so, estimating 50-200 inhabitants per ha would lead one to conclude that this site was inhabited by between 25 and 100 inhabitants.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "The rich resources of the Nile combined with the new domesticates could be effectively and intensively exploited.
