A second unusual feature of the burials was the placement of 110 stone artefacts, almost all in positions that suggest they had penetrated the bodies as either arrow or spear points. ... Indeed, several pieces were found still embedded in the sphenoid bones of the skull, in positions that indicate the projectiles had entered from under the lower jaw. In all, more than 40 per cent of the burials contained these smallf flake points. Four persons had suffered multiple wounds, with points still embedded in their bones. In the majority of cases, however, the points were not embedded in bone but lay within the skeletal remains, suggesting they had penetrated the soft tissue. One grave yielded eight bodies that had apparently been buried together.

Feasting relationships are fundamental to structuring power relationships within communities, and have even been described as an institution comparable to parliamentary democracy (Clarke 2001). Typically, support networks and competition between networks operate primarily at the level of lineages or corporate kindreds (such as the tongkonans in the Torajan area), with only a loose correspondence between individual household production and feasting activity. However, in all situations, it is clear that feasting constitutes the single most important consumption activity of surpluses and that there is significant competition to display wealth at the most important feasts. Feasts can also be used to underwrite major labour-intensive projects such as house building, irrigation works, planting and harvesting (Dietler and Herbrich 2001; Dietler 1990)."</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ [25-100] ♥</b> "Excavations at the Badarian site of Deir Tasa revealed a settlement covering an area of about 5000 m (Gabra, 1930)" <sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup>, so, estimating 50-200 inhabitants per ha would lead one to conclude that this site was inhabited by between 25 and 100 inhabitants.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "The rich resources of the Nile combined with the new domesticates could be effectively and intensively exploited.

Feasting relationships are fundamental to structuring power relationships within communities, and have even been described as an institution comparable to parliamentary democracy (Clarke 2001). Typically, support networks and competition between networks operate primarily at the level of lineages or corporate kindreds (such as the tongkonans in the Torajan area), with only a loose correspondence between individual household production and feasting activity. However, in all situations, it is clear that feasting constitutes the single most important consumption activity of surpluses and that there is significant competition to display wealth at the most important feasts. Feasts can also be used to underwrite major labour-intensive projects such as house building, irrigation works, planting and harvesting (Dietler and Herbrich 2001; Dietler 1990)."</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ [25-100] ♥</b> "Excavations at the Badarian site of Deir Tasa revealed a settlement covering an area of about 5000 m (Gabra, 1930)" <sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup>, so, estimating 50-200 inhabitants per ha would lead one to conclude that this site was inhabited by between 25 and 100 inhabitants.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "The rich resources of the Nile combined with the new domesticates could be effectively and intensively exploited.
