They are a nation of nomads, moving from place to place with their herds."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The end of Yuezhi rule is marked by the seizure of power by the first Kushan king, Kujula Kadphises. We have no fixed date for this but Loeschner thinks it may have been as early as 20 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_AfTochr] In contrast, Osmund Bopearachchi gives a date of 40 CE for the start of Kujula Kadphises' reign.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_AfTochr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b>"Around 100 BCE the Yueh-chih conquered Bactria and drove the Scythians southwards to Gandhara.

The region was politically fragmented and the local settled populations were subjected to nomadic invasions, notably by a group of pastoralists and traders known to us by their Chinese name, Yuezhi.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_AfTochr] The Yuezhi are also sometimes referred to as 'Tochari' by scholars who believe they spoke a Tocharian language, part of an extinct Indo-European language group.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_AfTochr] (Others argue that their original language was eastern Iranic or proto-Turkic.)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the mid-1st millennium BCE and perhaps even earlier, the Yuezhi were living on the steppes to the north of China.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_AfTochr] However, after coming into conflict with other nomadic groups, the Xiongnu and Wusun, they migrated towards Sogdiana.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_AfTochr] By 129 BCE, when the Han Chinese diplomat Zhang Qian visited the Yuezhi court on the Oxus river, they were ruling over a region that included parts of the old Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian kingdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the early 1st century CE, the first Kushan king, Kujula Kadphises, seized power and began ruling over south-eastern Sogdiana, marking the end of our Yuezhi period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_AfTochr] Kujula Kadphises was probably a member of one of five Yuezhi factions or subtribes, which he succeeded in unifying through military conquest,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_AfTochr] but even this is disputed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Yuezhi in Bactria and Sogdiana seem to have been organized into a federation of five tribes that competed for political supremacy in the new territory.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_AfTochr] There is no written or numismatic evidence of a centralized Yuezhi state with a single paramount ruler before the rise of Kujula Kadphises.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_AfTochr] Historian Craig Benjamin has characterized Yuezhi control over the sedentary population of northern Bactria and Sogdia as that of a militarily superior ruling dynasty of nomads, 'pastoralist conquerors' whose 'nominal sovereignty' was acknowledged by the locals because they feared violence if they refused to submit.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_AfTochr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Secure estimates for the combined population of the ruling Yuezhi and the settled population under their control in this period are lacking.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Agathe Dupeyron; Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=AfTochr&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [10,000-20,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]If we divide the Zarafshan valley between two realms we get about 15,000 km2 for each of them.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Thus, both the written sources and the numismatic data show that Transoxiana in the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C.lacked internal political unity.

There is basically no information on Sogdiana concerning this period other than what is related in the Chinese sources [...] Around 160-130 BCE, the region was crisscrossed by various waves of migratory nomads from the north, whether they were Iranian-speaking Saka or the Yuezhi from within China. Beginning in the first century BCE, most of Sogdiana was included in a larger nomadic state, centered on the middle Syr Darya, namely Kangju. On the other hand, the Yuezhi principalities and then the Kushan empire incorporated the southeast part of Sogdiana (south of the Hissar mountains), which thereafter left the Sogdian sphere and was attached to Bactria.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_AfTochr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [100,000-225,000]  ♥</b> People.

This is a rough estimate that needs to be checked by an expert.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]If there were at least two realms within the Zarafshan basin then the population estimate should be divided between them (200,000). Another source suggests a federation of five tribes - so the estimate could also be divided between five (80,000). These figures presumably refer to the migrant population: how many inhabitants were there already living in the locales (if the invasion was not accompanied by genocide)? <span style="color:purple">(JR: Woodcock said that 'there is no evidence of any general or even local massacre of the ordinary Greek population [in Bactria] after the nomad victories'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_AfTochr])</span> Given the relatively small size of these polities, this latter estimate could be directly added to the total.

Greek speakers were still around, other steppe people such as Scythians or Sakas had their own dialects, and the indigenous people spoke their own languages. To become rulers of people who had a strong literary tradition the Yuezhi-Kushan, who so far as we know did not have a written language when they arrived at Bactria, had to make adjustments and even compromises with this linguistic environment when ruling and trading with other peoples.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_137_AfTochr] 'The period from the mid-second century B.C.E., when the Yuezhi tribe began conquering Bactria, to c. 50 C.E. when the Kushan king Kujula Kadaphises crossed the Hindu Kush to conquer north India, was the time that the Yuezhi was transformed from a nomadic tribe into a sedentary society'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_138_AfTochr] Might this indicate an adoption of the written records and administrative structures found in the preceding Greco-Bactrian kingdom?

However, Liu's discussion of Yu's interpretation of the <i>xihou</i> makes reference to a singular 'Yuezhi ruler' with the power to appoint local princes: 'Yu Taishan argued that the five tribes, or <i>Xihou</i> as recorded in Chinese history, unified by the Kushan were not necessarily from the Yuezhi, because the <i>Xihou</i> was not a known institution in the Yuezhi structure before they entered Bactria. The <i>Xihou</i> were probably tribal chiefs in Bactria before the Yuezhi and were assigned by the Yuezhi ruler to maintain order there. While those tribes were probably Tuharan speakers, there is also the possibility that they were Sakas, who spoke another Indo-European language'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_140_AfTochr] (<i>Xihou</i> is used here to refer both to the tribal divisions and to their respective rulers).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Prestige of state-level bureaucracy ♣ ♥</b><b>Authority over state-level administrators</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Direct ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Indirect ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Diffused ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mixed ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Governmental control ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Non-governmental oversight ♣ ♥</b><b>Source of Support of state-level officials</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ State salary ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Governed population ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Chinese historian Sima Qian records that before the Yuezhi were forced westwards by attacks from the Xiongnu, 'the authority of the Yüeh-chih ruler was accepted by the countries in Central Asia.

Little is known about the latter, but Buddhism, Hinduism, Greek thought and Zoroastrianism all contain claims regarding proper moral behaviour. Buddhism: “If ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’ constitute the one root of suffering - both the suffering one undergoes oneself in sansaric existence, and the suffering one inflicts upon others - it follows that any successful attempt to reduce one’s ‘thirst’ and to moderate one’s ‘attachment’ will also result in a life causing less suffering (at least less deliberately-inflicted suffering) to others - and this is what morality basically means for Buddhism: reducing suffering, alleviating suffering, causing less suffering. Morality is an intrinsic part of the path to salvation because it is part and parcel of the salvific process of overcoming ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_265_AfTochr] Hinduism: “Universal dharma relates to all humanity and it includes ethical virtues such as compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence. These virtues that are said to be common to all humans are known as sadhārana (common) or sanatana (eternal) dharma. For example, the Law of Manu (X:63) argues that non-injury, truth, not stealing, purity and control of the senses summarise dharma for the four castes. Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is. Nevertheless, in theory, the ethical virtues of compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence are universally regarded by most Hindus.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_266_AfTochr] Greek thought: “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor—it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_267_AfTochr] Zoroastrianism: for a Zoroastrian worshipper, "The moral requirements of his faith make him self-reliant, bearing the responsibility for his own conduct and ultimate fate".

Not much is known about the latter. In Greek religion: "Greeks did not necessarily assume that the gods could read their minds and knew the inner secrets of their heart and so forth. However, they definitely assumed that gods could see and hear everything they did. I don’t think the gods were concerned with people’s thoughts unless these thoughts manifested themselves in words or actions. This is not to say that they could never read minds, just that it wasn’t part and parcel of how they were represented, the way it is, for example, with the Christian god.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_347_AfTochr] In Hinduism: "Each Purana tends to focus on a specific deity as the Supreme Being responsible for creating and ordering the world. [...] Thus, [for example,] Krishna [...] is a form of the supreme God who creates, maintains, and destroys the universe. In the Bhagavad Gita , Arjuna is permitted to glimpse Krishna’s cosmic form. He sees the entire universe, the sun, stars, and planets, and all the people gathered on the battlefield within the body of Krishna. Krishna tells him that everything that exists is part of himself, but that he is not limited to everything that exists. In other words, just as the Vedic Purusha extended ten finger-lengths beyond the created universe, so too Krishna is the entire cosmos and more." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_348_AfTochr] In Zoroastrianism: "The name of the supreme God of the Zoroastrian faith is Ahura Mazda (or Ohrmazd). He is self-created, omniscient, omnipresent, holy, invisible, and beyond human conceptualization (Yasna 4.7, 29.4, 31.13, 45.5; Yasht 1.7, 1.8, 1.12, 1.13-14; Videvdat 2.1, 19.20)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_349_AfTochr] In Buddhism: "There are numerous Higher Gods, but these are remote and sublime beings who have little involvement in human affairs. Nevertheless, they are subject to karma and are eventually reborn like everyone else."

Not enough appears to be known about the latter to be able to say whether the gods they focussed on were thought to be omniscient. And, similarly, it is not very clear whether omniscience would have been seen as a characteristic of Siva. However, even by looking only at the remaining three religions, it is clear that this variable cannot be coded as either "absent" or "present". Regarding Buddhism, the idea of an all-knowing God runs contrary to the emphasis that this religion places on an individual's responsibility for their own spiritual development [MAJIDBENAM_REF_352_AfTochr]. Regarding Zoroastrianism, the god Ahura-Mazda is a fairly straightforward omniscient deity [MAJIDBENAM_REF_353_AfTochr]. And as for Greek deities, “Everything depends on what you mean by “omniscience.” First, there is the distinction between “knowing everything important,” like who committed a crime or who will win the war, and true omniscience, which includes everything which can be known (things like “the fall of a sparrow” and how many grains of sand are on a beach). Very few Greek gods claimed true omniscience. The only example I know is that it was claimed for Apollo at Delphi, who was specifically an oracular god. So it was his business to know everything. The claim seems to have been put forward by the sanctuary in order to enhance his prestige. Greek philosophers presumably believed in divine omniscience because they represented the gods or the divine as perfect, which would require absolute knowledge, but these issues do not seem to have really come to the fore in the literature until the Roman period and Christianity, so far as I can tell. Even if omniscience only means “knowing everything that it is important to know,” I have my doubts about whether the Greek gods possessed it. I would say that it was always contextual. They knew whatever it was important to know in a given context. Greeks did not necessarily assume that the gods could read their minds and knew the inner secrets of their heart and so forth. However, they definitely assumed that gods could see and hear everything they did. I don’t think the gods were concerned with people’s thoughts unless these thoughts manifested themselves in words or actions. This is not to say that they could never read minds, just that it wasn’t part and parcel of how they were represented, the way it is, for example, with the Christian god.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_354_AfTochr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Omnipotent supernatural beings ♣ uncertain_present_absent ♥</b> At different times during Kushan history, and in different combinations, Kushan emperors patronised Greek religion, Hinduism (specifically, Siva worship), Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism [MAJIDBENAM_REF_355_AfTochr], as well as a number of less well-known Indo-Iranian cults.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsaric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21)."

[...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended.

Not much is known about the latter. In Greek religion: "Hesiod is generally quick to remark that the gods are pleased when the rites are performed correctly, and are displeased when proper ritual purity is not obtained. [...] We can also observe different grades of divine anger: libating with unwashed hands renders the ritual null and void, and the gods refuse to communicate with the worshipper. The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity. The intensity of the contact with the divinity corresponds directly to the intensity of the purity required for the worshipper and to the severity of the divine punishment if this requirement is violated."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_412_AfTochr]  In Hinduism: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths...So, the effects of one’s actions in life determine what one will experience after death, and what kind of life one will have in the next birth. In this way, even if a person does not seem to receive all the rewards or punishments deserved in a particular life, the scales will be balanced in the future." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_413_AfTochr] "The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled <i>Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications</i>. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste."

Discussing the nomadic states on the western fringes of China, Barfield says that 'Grain was one of the products most in demand by nomads, but because this trade was so ordinary it is scantily documented and scholars continue to argue over whether the steppe nomads included grain as a regular part of their diet'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_553_AfTochr] His comments seem likely to apply to the Yuezhi occupation of Transoxania and Bactria too.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Top fortune ♣ unknown ♥</b> I have not found a numerical figure for the top fortune in this period. However, the six burials excavated at the site of Tillya Tepe in northern Afghanistan, dating to the mid-1st century CE, were 'extremely rich', containing 'goods from the length of Eurasia, including glass from the Roman west and mirrors from the Han Chinese east'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_554_AfTochr] There is some disagreement about the ethnic identity of these people, but they 'have generally been considered to be settled descendants of the nomadic Yuezhi and most scholars have described them as "proto-Kushans"'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_555_AfTochr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Other wealth distribution ♣ ♥</b> Barfield's model of nomadic states in Central Asia compares them to 'redistributive chiefdoms': they extract (or extort) tribute from sedentary populations and distribute the ensuing wealth among the 'tribes' that make up the nomadic confederation. 'Nomad states were more like redistributive chiefdoms. They lacked a strong class structure and the leaders' main responsibilities internally were organizational rather than extractive. They were expected to provide real benefits and prestige goods to component tribes and their leaders'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_556_AfTochr] He focuses on those nomadic 'empires' on the borders of the Chinese state, but perhaps this economic model could also apply to the Yuezhi in Transoxiana, who, if we believe the Chinese sources, migrated westward from their homeland in modern Gansu province.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Dedicated police force ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The Tocharians were a nomadic group who conquered a region (Transoxania and Bactria) which had settled peoples living in walled towns and cities.
