It was continuously inhabited between 250 BCE and 1300 CE. 'Jenne-jeno IV' refers to the period from 900 to 1300 CE. This roughly corresponds to the tail end of the region's 'urban prosperity' phase, and the beginning of the 'urban shake-up'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_MlJeJe4] By this period, the inhabitants of Jenne-jeno had established long-distance trade networks and developed bronzeworking. Around 1000, they started working with brass, and the population continued to grow, reaching its peak between 1100 and 1200. They also produced an impressive corpus of terracotta figurines. However, in the 13th century, the population decreased rapidly, eventually leading to the abandonment of several sites, Jenne-jeno included, by 1400. The reasons for the decline are unclear, but they may include climate change, pandemic diseases such as plague, cultural upheaval deriving from the arrival of Islam and horses, and the emergence of the great West African empires of Ghana, Mali and Songhai.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates could be found specifically for this period. However, the combined population of Jenne-jeno and its satellites within a one-kilometre radius had probably reached 10,000-26,000 people by 800 CE. The population continued to grow until 1200, and then rapidly declined in the 13th and 14th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The political organization of Jenne-jeno may have been quite different from that of other ancient cities. In several decades of excavation, clear evidence for hierarchies of any kind has yet to be unearthed: it seems that Jenne-jeno had no palaces, rich tombs, temples, public buildings, or monumental architecture. Indeed, the city's very layout ‒ an assemblage of dispersed clusters ‒ suggests a resistance to centralization.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MlJeJe4] It is possible that, at this time, Niger Inland Delta society was organized 'heterarchically' rather than hierarchically: that is, it was divided into multiple components, each deriving authority from separate or overlapping sources, with mechanisms in place to prevent any one group from monopolizing power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MlJeJe4]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MlJeJe4&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 1,100 ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1,100 square kilometer hinterland [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"over 60 archaeological sites rise from the floodplain within a 4 kilometer radius of the modern town"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The mound that rose from the Niger floodplain with the growth of Jenne-jeno did not stand alone.

In other words, who keeps the peace? This is the first fundamental complaint raised by the distinctiveness of these towns with the traditional 'hierarchy as adaptive solution' approach to emerging complex society. To date, excavation at sites such as Jenne-jeno reveals no obvious signs of social stratification, as opposed to abundant evidence of (horizontal) social complexification. Where are the public buildings, the monuments, the shrines to state ideologies that classic preindustrial city theory tells use should be present? One has the strong impression of a highly complex society, with multiple overlapping and competing agencies of authority and decision making, and of resistance to centralization. The city's lay-out - the dispersed cluster - was an instrument of that resistance."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"This assertion that heterarchy, rather than hierarchy, is the better description of authority at these cities recalls persistent Mande notions of who has decision-making roles in society, notions very familiar to historians, social anthropologists and art historians.

Urn burials could be primary interments or secondary ones, and the dead were either buried in specialised cemetery areas or residential areas, with two exceptions (most notably, an infant buried near city wall); three double inhumations in urns and one double cremation in an urn found, but unusual. Inhumations either in cemetery or residential areas, but also one in an apparently exposed area of the site; wide range of orientations. Infant and child burials in urns only, and the rare multiple burials involve adult or subadult individuals of both sexes, in those cases where sex can be deteremined. Also possible gender associations with orientation: women east and men west. But samples are very small. Grave goods rare (copper ring fragment in one cases, iron bracelets in two).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Gatherings/ritual space</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ironworking workshops. McIntosh speculates that this marks the possible origin of smith/smelter corporate groups, with associated ritual practices and beliefs, regarding which there is a rich literature. Mostly to do with guarding secret knowledge/technique for taming uncontrollable force of the elements/occult entities (earth, iron, fire, etc). Adoption of "fearsome symbols that are dangerous to the uninitiated". This is a combination of speculation, ethnographic analogy, and, also, apparently illogical decisions, on the part of Jenne-jeno smiths, regarding the sourcing of iron and placement of smelting/smithing workshops. Admittedly, grounds for speculation are more solid for this final phase of the Jenne-jeno sequence, as a smith's workshop dating to this phase was excavated which contained a male-female terracotta figure in one of its walls, suggesting that the smith thought it was important to secure supernatural protection for his place of work, as well as the possible remains of a shrine.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Gathering of representative of different corporate groups. Based on McIntosh's speculation that Jenne-jeno society was divided according to the craft-based corporations that characterise modern-day societies in the region (mostly the Mande). No archaeological evidence for the gathering itself, only some evidence of the existence of these corporate groups in terms of apparent diversity of ritual beliefs and practices, including burial methods, as well as apparent division of site on the basis of craft/activities, and apparent lack of hierarchical power structure. Also division of site into many different mound clusters.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Feasting</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]No evidence.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Art</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Large number of terracotta figurines have been unearthed at Jenne-jeno and nearby sites. They mostly depict human figures in a variety of poses (kneeling, reclining, embracing other human figures, sitting, riding a horse, standing as if at attention) and ornamented with elaborate jewellery (suggestive of high status), snakes (arranged around the figure's body like necklaces or bracelets, and suggestive of some kind of "snake cult") and/or bulging pustules (suggestive of some dreadful, forgotten disease). Some terracottas also depict non-human subjects. Many looted and therefore context-less, unfortunately, but a few found in a wide variety of contexts--hidden in the wall of an iron-smelter's house or workshop, buried under the floor of a deliberately razed house, placed on an altar, and discarded in a trash heap at the city's periphery after what may have been a deliberate act of mutilation.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Sources</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]McIntosh, R. 2005.

However, the people of Jenne-jeno did produce a large quantity of terracotta figurines, and it is seems likely that these were used in ritual contexts--as suggested, for example, by the fact that some of these figurines were found concealed inside the walls of houses and workshops. According to Roderick McIntosh [MAJIDBENAM_REF_192_MlJeJe4], the figurines may have been worshipped in a way analogous to Roman household gods, though perhaps their worship was meant to benefit families or people that were part of "corporations" rather than individual families--that is, groups of people who shared the same craft or economic activity, such as ironworking, woodworking, or fishing. It is perhaps possible to reconstruct such rituals on the basis of what we know about Roman household rituals [MAJIDBENAM_REF_193_MlJeJe4], as well as ethnographically-documented West African boliw rituals [MAJIDBENAM_REF_194_MlJeJe4].

few clues regarding the rituals practised at Jenne-jeno. However, the people of Jenne-jeno did produce a large quantity of terracotta figurines, and it is seems likely that these were used in ritual contexts--as suggested, for example, by the fact that some of these figurines were found concealed inside the walls of houses and workshops. Moreover, there is evidence for ironworking at Jenne-jeno as well, and, historically, this craft has long been associated with esoteric practices, both in Sub-Saharan Africa generally and in West Africa specifically. Based on these two clues, it may be reasonable to infer the existence of somewhat dysphoric crafting rituals among the people of Jenne-jeno, similar to ones practised by some of the modern-day inhabitants of the region. These rituals would have been performed in seclusion, so as not to break the secrecy of the craft in question (be it ironworking, figurine making, or something else which would have left little or no evidence in the archaeological record, such as woodworking), but they would have involved at least two people, the craftsperson and their apprentice. They would have required some preparation--perhaps fasting, sexual abstinence, drug use, sacrifices and/or divination. This preparation may have lasted longer than the act of crafting proper.

However, no references to Jenne-Jeno using military force to conquer other peoples and demand tribute. Army that is referred to could have been late in period and intended for defence? Djenne was a new city 2.5km south-east of Jenne-jeno - what relationship was there - if any - between the old and the new cities? There is a reference to a Sovereign of Djenne who was was converted to Islam in the 12th century probably by ulema religious scholars.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_307_MlJeJe4] We could hypothesize that Djenne started out as a political, military and ritual center which controlled the economic center at Jenne-Jeno, until Djenne took that over itself. However, this is my speculation. R and S McIntosh says: "Analyses conducted thus far have not yielded any information on the possible reasons for the new settlement at Djenné."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_308_MlJeJe4]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Reader (1998) says at Jenne-Jeno there is no evidence of a hierarchical social system[MAJIDBENAM_REF_309_MlJeJe4] Jenne-jeno was "a large, complex, but non-coercive urban settlement"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_310_MlJeJe4]: "the demands of specialization pushed groups apart while the requirements of a generalized economy pulled them together ... created a dynamism that ensured growth and the establishment of urban settlements. And they were non-coercive settlements. Groups congregated by choice. This is an instance of transformation from a rural to an urban society that did not establish a hierarchical society and coercive centralized control... The process in the delta and at Jenne-jeno in particular, was one of 'complexification' rather than centralization."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_311_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, though apparently not supported by archaeology, there is a reference to a Sovereign of Djenne who was was converted to Islam in the 12th century probably by ulema religious scholars.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_312_MlJeJe4] Djenne was a new city 2.5km south-east of Jenne-jeno - what relationship was there - if any - between the old and the new cities?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We know the citizens of Jenne-Jeno organized the building of a town wall. "Its inhabitants also built high protecting walls round their city, somewhat like those that may still be seen at Kano".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_313_MlJeJe4] This suggests capacity to become organized as a city-wide group did exist so some government and hierarchy developed. The form of authority may not have been very hierarchical and probably did not involve a kingship. We could speculate some kind of government was responsible for building the wall, there was some kind of administration and record keeping, perhaps in relation to trade and public markets. Since the archaeology has not found any government or royal infrastructure for any hypothetical taxation to be spent on, any administrators who did exist may have been unpaid merchant or craftworking elites who would not have worked from specialized governmental or monumental royal buildings. Taxation may have been ad hoc, used only when required for public necessity. Scholars have used the word "heterarchy" to refer to the possibility of a society like this at Jenne-jeno.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>"This assertion that heterarchy, rather than hierarchy, is the better description of authority at these cities recalls persistent Mande notions of who has decision-making roles in society, notions very familiar to historians, social anthropologists and art historians. Authority is shared amongst many corporate groups rather than being the monopoly of a charismatic individual (in Weber's sense) or of one bureaucratic lineage."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_314_MlJeJe4]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The general reference for West African societies was that "protection was given in exchange for taxes or regular payments of one kind or another. In this way, free men often became vassals or subjects of sub-chiefs, or of big chiefs, or of kings and emperors."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_315_MlJeJe4] The presence of "a large, complex, but non-coercive urban settlement"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_316_MlJeJe4] a Jenne-Jeno would contradict this general fact. It also would provide a huge contrast to the neighbouring Ghana Empire of the period. There, Ibn Hawqal and Al-Bakri reported servants or slaves of the Ghana king were sacrificed at royal funerals[MAJIDBENAM_REF_317_MlJeJe4] which suggests for a time Ghana was a very heirarchical and coercive society. Islam, which prohibited human sacrifice, was not the religion of state rulers in Ghana until 1077 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_318_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Nevertheless, it may be relevant that, in general terms, the West African states were ruled by a non-landowning nobility who lived on "the institution of a tax, first conceived of as a tithe, a ritual deduction on the wealth of all subjects".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_319_MlJeJe4] "The African king, however powerful, was easily persuaded that the soil did not belong to him".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_320_MlJeJe4] "The sale of land, properly speaking, seems to have been unknown in traditional pre-colonial Africa. ... Instead of land having constituted a wealth beyond the reach of certain social categories, it was within everyone's grasp, with no need to forfeit one's freedom, like the serf bound to the soil, in order to make use of it, to 'possess' it. The slave had his own patch of ground; the stranger who just this morning came to the village would also get his. Expropriation of the sort seen in sixteenth-century Europe was unthinkable in the history of precolonnial Africa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_321_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It may be logical to posit that once trade cities which were complex enough to be centers for craftsmen (leather, wood, ivory, metal) were established "city governments were needed, as well as men trained to be put in charge of keeping accounts, of maintaining law and order, of looking after the safety of citizens. Then the rulers of these cities began to extend their power to ever wider regions of the neighbouring countryside."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_322_MlJeJe4] According to al-Bakri, the king of Ghana could "employ large numbers of messengers and other servants."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_323_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Jenne-jeno the problem with this idea is: "where are the elites, the chiefs, the kings, the early state bureaucracies? ... To date, excavation at sites such as Jenne-jeno reveals no obvious signs of social stratification, as opposed to abundant evidence of (horizontal) social complexification. Where are the public buildings, the monuments, the shrines to state ideologies that classic preindustrial city theory tells use should be present?"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_324_MlJeJe4][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The society at Jenne-Jeno may have reflected a more egalitarian "stream" based on presence of long-term, high-volume historic merchant activity, that linked the resources of Western Africa with the complex societies north of the Sahara desert. In comparison, Ghana Empire which was further north and directly bordered the Sahara, while equally involved in trade and with traders, developed a military aristocracy. Of the latter, Niane (1975) wrote (translated): "These three great tribes of warriors - the fados, or warrior class - formed the aristocracy, from which state administrators and court dignitaries came from. They constitute the nobility through breeding, because all come from the Wago family, whose country of origin is Wagadou (it should be noted that the nobility is called wagheya).<i>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_325_MlJeJe4]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Jenne-jeno, in contrast, this centralization of power and militarized elite did not appear to have happened: "One has the strong impression of a highly complex society, with multiple overlapping and competing agencies of authority and decision making, and of resistance to centralization. The city's lay-out - the dispersed cluster - was an instrument of that resistance."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_326_MlJeJe4] Diop (1987) says a "Sana-faran was their general-in-chief"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_327_MlJeJe4] and that he had officers under his orders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_328_MlJeJe4]). However, no references to Jenne-Jeno using military force to conquer other peoples and demand tribute. Army that is referred to could have been late in period and intended for defence, to maintain its independence against the growing military power of the empires of Western Sudan.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Prestige of state-level bureaucracy ♣ lower ♥</b><b>Authority over state-level administrators</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Direct ♣ uncertain_absent_present ♥</b> <i>"This assertion that heterarchy, rather than hierarchy, is the better description of authority at these cities recalls persistent Mande notions of who has decision-making roles in society, notions very familiar to historians, social anthropologists and art historians.
