their exports by three times.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_ItPapM2] Rome remained what it had long been, a parasitic drain on the Agro Romano.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_ItPapM2] An important contribution to the future

class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1648-1809 CE ♥</b> The polity period begins with the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War (with the Peace of Westphalia), and the second War of Castro (1649). One end date could be 1796 CE, when the armies of the French Directorate invaded the peninsula, ending the <i>ancien regime.</i> Alternatively one could code the end-date as 1809 CE, when Napoleon annexed the Papal State outright, imprisoning Pope Pius VII in Savona.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_ItPapM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary ♥</b>  By this period, the papacy was in unchallenged control of the territory encompassed by the Papal States, especially following the War of Castro (see above).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b> It is hard to firmly characterize the supra-polity relations of the Papacy during this period; hegemony on the Italian peninsula shifted from the <i>pax hispanica</i> of the early 17th century to French and then Austrian domination, before the onset of the French revolutionary armies in 1796. I use "alliance" to denote the fact that the papacy was usually dependent on a stronger external power for protection, although the papacy was no longer engaged in wars after the end of the "War of Castro" of the 1640s.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_ItPapM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ ItPapM1 ♥</b>  Papal State, Holy Wars</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Napoleonic Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Roman Catholicism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Rome ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Latin ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Catholic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ Roman Catholic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The papacy was victorious in the Second War of Castro (1649). This was only the denouement of a minor episode, however, and in general the Papal State was a political fossil, undertaking no reforms in the spirit of the Enlightenment, and increasingly irrelevant to European affairs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ItPapM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The first part of this period marked the definitive eclipse of the papacy as a power of any reckoning in international relations. Pope Urban VIII had annexed the Duchy of Urbino to the Papal States in 1631, thereby alienating the papacy from the other Italian powers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItPapM2] The first war of Castro broke out in 1641 when Urban declared war on the Farnese, the ruling family of Parma, over the poor finances of Castro, a small fiefdom held by the Farnese just north of Rome. Tuscany, Modena and Venice joined the Farnese to resist the papacy, and inflicted humiliating defeats on the papal armies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItPapM2] In 1644, the French imposed a peace settlement. Although Pope Innocent X's troops took Castro and razed it to the ground in 1649, the papacy was now isolated internationally and increasingly irrelevant. The papacy took no part in the Peace of Westphalia, and it was also not consulted in the Franco-Spanish Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItPapM2] The papacy took no part in European wars for the rest of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The papacy's irrelevance internationally can be seen as part of the decline of the Spanish empire, as had benefited from Spanish protection during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItPapM2] The French came to dominate European affairs during the reign of Louis XIV, but the struggle for power in Europe did not seriously affect the Papal State until the turn of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Warfare ravaged the peninsula in the early eighteenth century, as the (Austrian) Habsburgs and French Bourbons battled to fill the vacuum created by Spain's gradual eclipse.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapM2] These wars were external events imposed on the Italian states, and they took as little part as possible. Spanish attempts to recruit troops at Rome in the 1730s were met by serious riots, for example.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItPapM2] The War of the Austrian Succession devastated areas of the Marches and Romagna, but the papacy, it seems, was powerless to prevent foreign armies' depredations.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItPapM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]As the eighteenth century progressed, this weakness, even impotence, became ever more marked. Clement XI in 1720 and Clement XII called for an Italian league to expel northern rulers, but these appeals were meaningless because the papacy controlled no armies worth speaking of.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItPapM2] Thus, international relations between the papacy and the European powers during the later 18th century consisted of papal resistance to European states' attempts to restrain the power of the Church.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItPapM2] This took its characteristic form in the French and Spanish expulsion of the Jesuit Order from their domains; in 1773, Pope Clement XIV suppressed the order.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItPapM2] As a reward, the French restored Avignon and the Spanish Benevento to the papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItPapM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The papacy opposed the French Revolution from the beginning, and by 1792, there was a schism in France between Catholics who supported the Church sanctioned by the Revolutionary regime, and those who remained faithful to Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItPapM2] Pius VI sympathized with the Habsburgs and the revolutionary regime's enemies, and his successor was powerless in the face of Bonaparte's 1796 invasion of the peninsula.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItPapM2] Indeed, the papal ambassador Zelada's reply to British requests for papal approval of the war against the French was the following:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItPapM2] "'It is true that there was a time when the voice of the Roman Pontiff was heard, respected, and obeyed; now...it is scarcely listened ever listened to, and never has any effect.'" Although the British fleet had briefly protected the Papal States' coasts from the French, by 1796 the British had withdrawn.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItPapM2] Napoleon did not initially invade the Papal States proper, only the Legation cities of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrara; in the following peace treaty, the French annexed Ravenna, Bologna, Ancona, and the right of entry to all papal ports.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapM2] The papacy furthermore had to pay Napoleon 21 million crowns. War recommenced in 1797, and Bonaparte marched almost unopposed down the eastern coast of the peninsula, stealing whatever the papal government had not yet removed of the treasury at Loreto and forcing terms on the papacy at Tolentino in mid-February.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItPapM2] Refusing to acquiesce in French domination, Pius VI was arrested in February 1798 and bundled off to prison in Valence, France.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The second half the 1600s was marked by a renewal of "Christianization" efforts, i.e., to educate the laity and ensure a stricter adherence to post-Tridentine Catholicism.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItPapM2] The wars, famines, and epidemics between 1610 and the mid-1650s had disrupted these efforts, but there was a "Tridentine revival" in the second half of the century resulting in Jesuit missions to the Kingdom of Naples, and more frequent pastoral visits by bishops.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItPapM2] The Inquisition, which had been institutionalized as the Roman Inquisition in the sixteenth century, was still active, although it may not have burnt as many heretics and witches as authorities north of the Alps.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItPapM2] The Inquisition censored books, although it was not necessarily successful at preventing their spread.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItPapM2] Pilgrimage remained popular, especially in Jubilee years (in this period, 1725, 1750, and 1775), and confraternities showed remarkable staying power, especially in the duchy of Benevento and the kingdom of Naples. Baptism and the Mass remained little changed, although parish records became a standard part of the Church's institutional machinery.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The seventeenth century was a period of major demographic and economic contraction, but by the mid-18th century, recovery had begun.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItPapM2] Gross has estimated that in 1684, the Papal States' trade and payment deficit was five million <i>scudi</i>; in 1786, the Papal States' imports exceeded their exports by three times.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItPapM2] Rome remained what it had long been, a parasitic drain on the Agro Romano.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItPapM2] The city consisted of a small plutocracy and a vast mass of artisans, courtiers, workers, and a major substratum of the permanently indigent; pilgrims added to the city's population and its coffers periodically. Ancona, on the other hand, experienced revived prosperity in the mid-18th century following Clement XII's decree making it a free port.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItPapM2] Bologna's economy was in decline due to the implosion of the textile trade.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItPapM2] An important contribution to the future demographic and economic health of Lazio was the draining of the Pontine Marshes, carried out under Popes Benedict XIV, Clement XIII, and Pius VI.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_ItPapM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Joe Figliulo-Rosswurm ♥</b>This polity was coded early, was the target of dedicated workshops, and had many experts look over it.

One of our best descriptions of a pilgrimage to Rome comes from a Perugian confraternity, the <i>Compagnia della Morte</i>, which made the Jubilee to Rome in 1600.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_ItPapM2] Confraternity members walked from Perugia to Rome and back, with singing, entertainment and feasting; at Rome, they visited the basilicas, and attended Mass at St. Peter's.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_ItPapM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br><i>Most widespread collective ritual, official cult:</i> Baptism was the fundamental rite in initiating children into the Christian community.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br><i>Most frequent collective ritual, official cult:</i> The Mass remained the basic collective ritual of Catholicism, with increasing emphasis in the post-Tridentine period on the Eucharist, with parishioners encouraged to take the Eucharist more than once a year in addition to more frequent confession.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_ItPapM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br><i>Most euphoric collective ritual, official cult:</i> Lay confraternities consisted of people organized for a shared religious life, usually based on a rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_ItPapM2] They were extremely common in this period-Rome around 1601 may have had 112 confraternities alone.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_ItPapM2] They carried out a variety of philanthropic and devotional activities, from distributing food to the poor to flagellant processions pilgrimages. Confraternities could serve to enforce social cohesion, and make peace between rival urban factions. Mixed confraternities, in which nobles associated with commoners or artisans, especially exemplify this. Confraternities could serve to strengthen group solidarity, but they could also divide communities: as at Bologna in the late sixteenth century, where the three confraternities of Buon Gesu, Santa Maria della Vita, and S.

The numbers of pilgrims were so great that not all were able to gain access to the church, whilst those inside were so tightly packed that they were unable to move. Suger described the agony of many women, who were caught in the crush and were so distressed that they cried out in pain as though in labour, whilst more were trampled underfoot.

The central ritual within the broader ritual of the Mass was the sacrament of the Eucharist. By the canons of Lateran IV, all the laity were required to receive the Eucharist, and thus attend Mass, at least once a year, on Easter.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_161_ItPapM2] Parish priests were supposed to say Mass daily, but the attendance of the laity, as the canon just discussed would indicate, was not required.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_162_ItPapM2] Because of the increasing importance attached to it on the part of the central ecclesiastical authorities during this period, we have more information on it than for the previous polity period. The sacrament of the Eucharist became central to the Mass after Lateran IV upheld the principle of transubstantiation, the principle that when the officiating priest elevated the wine and host, they became the body and blood of Christ.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_163_ItPapM2] This does not mean that the principle was widely accepted; indeed, its centrality is shown by the variety of dissenting opinions recorded all over Christendom regarding transubstantiation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_164_ItPapM2] Furthermore, so-called "dry masses" were also held, in which the Eucharist wasn't consecrated; these seem to have usually been part of funeral or wedding masses.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_165_ItPapM2] During this emphasis greater emphasis was laid on Christ's presence in the host, as part of the wider fixation on Christ's body, and the festival of Corpus Christi/Corpus Domini.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_166_ItPapM2] An important aspect to the increased sacramental importance of the Mass during this period is its functionalization. Masses for the dead became a major aspect of late medieval religiosity, with endowments for masses for the dead becoming an important part of testamentary culture.

[...] "Duelling enjoyed a widespread efflorescence, leaving its mark in the cultures of many different countries. [...] The duel had several immutable characteristics, which, despite variations from age to age and country to country, continued to define the institution. These characteristics were essentially the same in, for example, Henrician France, Georgian England, colonial India, republican America and Wilhelmine Germany. The most important of these were the challenge, the presence of seconds and the etiquette of the fight itself." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_219_ItPapM2] "The challenge was the first absolute requirement of the duel. Without a challenge to a duel, there could be no duel; any subsequent fight would be merely an assault or a brawl. So it was in practice, too. The challenge set in motion the formal protocols of the duelling codes. In fact, there was usually a stage before the sending of a formal challenge: this often took the form of a note, asking for an explanation of the complained-of behaviour or remarks. Such a note, it was hoped, could result in an immediate apology and an amicable settlement of the affair." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_220_ItPapM2] "Politics, gambling and sex were three of the more obvious sparks that, superficially, prompted duels to flare up; after all, most duels were caused by accusing someone of dishonesty." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_221_ItPapM2] "By the time the modern duel had grown into its maturity, seconds had mutated from active participants into an amalgam of umpire, cornerman and mediator. Once an argument had blown up, it was normal, if a duel was in the offing, to invite one's adversary to name a second, to whom a letter a letter could be sent, and to appoint one's own second. From this point onwards, the conduct of the duel was in the hands of the seconds; in a properly conducted affair, the principals remained in the background until they met on the duelling ground." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_222_ItPapM2] "The most important duties of the second before the duel took place were, in the case of a pistol duel, measuring the ground--that is, pacing out the agreed distance between the duellists--and loading the guns. In the case of a sword duel, it was vital to ensure that the swords were of equal length and type. In both cases it was the responsibility of the seconds to see that neither man had a disadvantage on account of the ground--for example, that one duellist was not facing the low sun or did not have loose ground underfoot."

The author of <i>The Art of Duelling</i> offers his advice about 'the night before' in a chapter headed 'Precautions to be Observed'. The duellist must treat the matter 'jocosely' and 'declare war against nervous apprehension'. He suggests an obvious solution: 'That his mind may not dwell upon the affair, he ought to invite a few friends to dinner, and laugh away the evening over a bottle of port; or, if fond of cards play a rubber whist.'</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"But the duellist and his friends should beware of overdoing it in their anxiety to take their minds off the morning's business.

The glossators elaborated the theory of plurality of dominia, whereas according to Roman law there could only be one such property. In the case of renting (location) Roman law did not privde a ius in re, a ‘real’ right covering the arrangement, defendable against all with an action in rem relavant to the agreement. The renting of property was viewed rather, in terms of an obligatory relationship and thus defensible only against the grantor (actio in personam). But because stable arrangements of this kind had been normal since the early middle ages, the jurists constructed the locatio ad longum tempus, or long-term lease as a real provision, quite separate from that governing ownership of property. This resulted in the establishment of the dominum utile (from the Roman acito utilis) at some time between the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century. It was agreed that were possible a rei vindication utilis (staking a claim to the property in the same way as that granted to the true owner) should apply to a rented dominum. In this way, an individual leasing property assumed a position that was closer to that of a proprietor, in the sense of being the formal holder of the land, as had already been established for vassals…and for grantees of location ad longum tempus.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_261_ItPapM2]</div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Transfer of property ♣ present ♥</b> “Once purchased from the papal datary, buyers could treat Capitoline notrial offices as they treated other forms of nonmovable property including leasing them, reselling them, or in the famous Roman device of the societa d’ufficio, breaking them up into portions and selling the portions to partners.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_262_ItPapM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Use of property ♣ absent ♥</b> Not mentioned in sources.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Property market ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “By the seventeenth century there was not much room to maneuver urbanistically; property lines were fixed, public land was jealously protected by civic officials, and recalcitrant neighbors could often maneuver around the laws authorizing their destruction.”  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_263_ItPapM2] “Once purchased from the papal datary, buyers could treat Capitoline notrial offices as they treated other forms of nonmovable property including leasing them, reselling them, or in the famous Roman device of the societa d’ufficio, breaking them up into portions and selling the portions to partners.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_ItPapM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Other property ownership ♣ present ♥</b> Once purchased from the papal datary, buyers could treat Capitoline notrial offices as they treated other forms of nonmovable property including leasing them, reselling them, or in the famous Roman device of the societa d’ufficio, breaking them up into portions and selling the portions to partners.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_265_ItPapM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Inheritance System</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ partible inheritance ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Present in Turin.

The aim of government was to assure people the enjoyment of their rights, which were liberty, equality, property, and security. [...] Property rights allowed everyone to gain by the fruits of his or her labor and industry.

For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage.

The institution was in essence a manifestation of punishment for the evils of the postlapsarian state. It was but a small cognitive step from there to the concept of the master-slave relationship as a reflection of the dichotomy between the righteous and sinners. The generalization of this concept from the individual sinner, or slave, to entire populations seemed entirely natural to theologians and jurists. Aquinas elaborated Aristotle’s notion that slavery, even if devised by man, was in accordance with natural law (‘’Summa contra Gentiles’’, 3), and he supported his position by emphasizing the obvious usefulness of slaves to society (‘’Summa theologiae’’). Bonaventure asserted that this social institution was a reflection of divine order. Those who were more intelligent were thought to be natural masters, while those less intellectually capable but more physically robust found their logical niche in a subservient condition.

Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms. It was taken for granted that the universe was designed in such a way that some of God’s creatures were intended to be at the topand some below them. Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality. Until late in the Middle Ages, few appear to have seen anything wrong with the idea that there should be rulers and ruled, for hierarchical arrangements of parts within wholes were a normal way of making an organism ‘work’. A body needs a head but it also needs feet (I Corinthians 12.20). In fragmentary survivals of the teaching which was given in the cathedral school at Laon at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries, there is a discussion of the passage in Ephesians 6.5 where servants are told to obey their masters. ‘It is no sin to have a servant or to be a servant.’ It was argued at Laon that there are two reasons why ‘servitude is given by God.’ It may be a punishment for the sins of those who are slaves or servants. Or it may have a purpose of proving or testing them, so that, humbled, they may be better people.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_376_ItPapM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> From the eighth century to the Counter-reformation era, from Scandinavia to France to Italy, Christian penitentials regularly included instructions regarding the kinds of penance clergy should assign to those guilty of the following acts: homicide, perjury, sacrilege, drunkenness, various types of sexual transgressions (including adultery, incest, sodomy and bestiality), sorcery, respect for one's parents, and theft[MAJIDBENAM_REF_377_ItPapM2].

It seems reasonable to infer continuity into the nineteenth century. “The Roman Catholic Church, after the 12th century, built an intricate body of family law upon this theological foundation. Since marriage was a sacrament, the church claimed exclusive jurisdiction over it, appropriating and expanding the laws of nature (Natural Law) and Scripture as well as some of the rules in the early church constitutions and Christianized Roman law. Comprehensive new laws, called canon laws, were promulgated by the papacy and the church councils and enforced by church courts throughout Western Christendom.//”Consistent with the naturalist perspective on marriage, the church’s canon law punished contraception, abortion, and child abuse as violations of the created functions of propagation and child rearing. It also proscribed unnatural sexual acts, such as sodomy and bestiality. Consistent with the contractual perspective, canon law ensured free consnsual unions by dissolving marriages contracted by mistake or under duress, fraud, or coercion. It also granted husband and wife equal rights to enforce conjugal debts that had been voluntarily assumed and emphasized the importance of mutual love among the couple, their children, and their parents.//”Consistent with the sacramental perspective canon law protcted the sanctity and sanctifying purpose of marriage by declaring valid marital bonds to be indissoluble and by annulling invalid unions between Christians and non-Christians or between parties related by various legal, spiritual, blood, or family ties. It supported celibacy by annulling unconsummated vows of marriage if one party made a vow of chastity and by prohibiting clerics on monastics from marriage and concubinage.//”Earlier Christianized Roman and Germanic laws governing the relationships between husband and wife, and parent and child, were liberally appropriated by the canonists and now enforced in the church courts as well as in the confessional (Confession of Sins). Traditional rules and customs of arranged marriages, patriarchal restrictions on the marital estate, male-dominated inheritance laws and primogeniture, protection of the status of the paterfamilias, and restrictions on the wife’s capacity to sue or be sued, to enter into contracts, to give or receive property of her own—all remained firmly in place in canon law.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_379_ItPapM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> “On the individual level, Augustine counseled nonresistance, hence, nonviolence; he worried that inordinate desires even to preserve one’s own life could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could lead further to evil deeds. augustine knew well the horrors of war and the lusts that war itself incites.

Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_380_ItPapM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> From the eighth century to the Counter-reformation era, from Scandinavia to France to Italy, Christian penitentials regularly included instructions regarding the kinds of penance clergy should assign to those guilty of the following acts: homicide, perjury, sacrilege, drunkenness, various types of sexual transgressions (including adultery, incest, sodomy and bestiality), sorcery, respect for one's parents, and theft[MAJIDBENAM_REF_381_ItPapM2].
