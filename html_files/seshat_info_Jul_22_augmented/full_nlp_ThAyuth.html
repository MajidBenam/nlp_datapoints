In 1681, at King Narai's behest, Phra Horathibodi, now composed a history which presented events using the lunar calendar to provide 'precise temporal context'. The result was the Luang Prasoet Chronicle, the first of the <i>phongsawadan</i> (dynastic history) genre, which related the history of Ayutthaya from 1324 to 1605, in which humans (the Kings) stand central, instead of Buddha" <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Philosophy ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Scientific literature ♣ present ♥</b> "As the records of astrologers, the <i>chotmaihet hon</i> display an overriding interest in the movements of the planets, and in significant, as well as unusual or unpredictable celestial and earthly events.

Soon after, it was recognised and its return celebrated by the whole population. The king od C'ieng Mai ordered that it be transferred to the capital. The statue was placed upon the back of a white elephant and accompanied by a procession. Along the road, lay people and bonzes paid tribute to the statue with songs, dancing and prayers.  Where the procession stopped, the Vessantarajataka was recited. In Jayasaka, the elephant fell down; the king understood that the statue would not make it to the capital and continued to Lampang, until 1481 when it moved to C'ieng Mai. It then went to Ventiane (1564), and Bangkok in 1778.  The Ratanabimbavamsa is the only book that gives some details on the cult of the Emerald Buddha in C'ieng Rai and Lampang. When the statue was first recognised, the king spread perfumed water on it; quickly followed by all inhabitants of the city. Those who had been virtuous saw the water turn to oil that made their lamps burn bright, and those who had sinned didn't see the water spread on the statue, it didn't fall into their lamps and neither was it converted to oil. However, if had begged forgiveness for their sins, the water turned to good oil. Hence, the statue was considered to be alive and capable of miracles. In Lampang, the statue was placed in a niche closed by a door. On the 8th, 14th and 15th days of the ascending and descending moon cycles, the door was opened for all to offer tribute and have devotions. In a specific period of the year, the statue was taken out and put on a throne in the centre of the vihara. The inhabitants of the city, preceded by the king and court, came in a procession carrying vases of scented water, to anoint the statue. The statue then emitted rays of green, yellow or white light. In Ventiane, the statue was placed in a special pavilion of the palace, and was given special furniture (golden bowl, parasol, umbrella and vases as well as cult objects) as well as 100 male and 100 female slaves to serve it. King Yotfa was very attached to the Emerald Buddha and required the presence of the statue in all ceremonies.  Vassals had to swear allegiance under the auspice of the statue. For crowning and New Year ceremonies, its presence was also required, and the statue was effectively transported to attend them until the mid 19th century. <sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> 8th and 15th day of the ascending and descending phases: this comes to 4 times in a period of 28/29 days, so about once a week.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ weekly ♥</b> 8th and 15th day of the ascending and descending phases: this comes to 4 times in a period of 28/29 days, so about once a week.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ weekly ♥</b> 8th and 15th day of the ascending and descending phases: this comes to 4 times in a period of 28/29 days, so about once a week.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> hours. one day.

"The rites take place with great splendour twice yearly, on the third day of the waxing of the fifth month (Chaitra), and on the thirteenth day of the waning of the tenth month (Bhadrapada). The Drinking of the Water takes place in the Chapel Royal in Bangkok, and also in one temple in each seat of provincial government. The water is previously hallowed in the usual way by the monks, who recite mantras, the sacred sincana thread being stretched round the water-vessels, while the Court Brahmans also dip into the water the State Sword and other royal weapons, this being a rite of contagious magic, by the power of which any official meditating treason would be destroyed. It is said that persons have not infrequently in the past died of cholera after drinking the hallowed water, a result which no doubt did much to strengthen the general belief in the efficacy of the magic. On the day of the ceremony a Brahman reads out the Oath, and each official must drink the contents of a small cup, which he must drain to the last drop. Any appearance of difficulty in swallowing was, in the old days, considered as equivalent to an admission of disloyalty. The ladies of the palace, as well as members of the royal family, drink the Water of Allegiance, but, of course, with suitable privacy. Officials confined to their houses through illness are not excused from drinking the Water, but it is taken to their bedsides by royal pages or other officials." <sup id="cite_ref-300" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-300">[300]</a></sup> The Oath of Allegiance is too long to be included here, but it involves asking supernatural forces to punish the participants very thoroughly were they to fail their king: "may [the gods] plague us with evil, destroy our lives, effect our destruction and death by breakage, by severance; cause our death by lightning and thunderbolts, by royal weapons, the powerful royal sword, by poison and the power of land and water animals; let there be some opportunity for the destruction of the perfidious ones; let swift destruction come; let us not escape all great disasters and consequences of all localities, which those who have the power can inflict for all offences. We beseech the power of the deities to plague with poisonous boils, rapidly fatal, and all manner of diseases the dishonourable, perverse, and treacherous, plague with untimely, wretched and appalling deaths, manifest to the eyes of the world; when we shall have departed this life from earth, cause us to be sent and all to be born in the great hell, where we shall burn with quenchless fire for tens and hundreds of thousands of ages and limitless transmigrations; and when we have expiated our penalty there, and are again born in any world, we pray we may fail to find the least happiness in worlds of pleasurable enjoyments; let us not meet the god Buddha, the sacred teachings, the sacred priests, who come to be gracious to animals, helping them escape misery, reach heaven and attain a cessation of births and deaths; should we meet them let them grant us no gracious assistance." <sup id="cite_ref-301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-301">[301]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ seasonally ♥</b> twice yearly "The rites take place with great splendour twice yearly, on the third day of the waxing of the fifth month (Chaitra), and on the thirteenth day of the waning of the tenth month (Bhadrapada)." <sup id="cite_ref-302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-302">[302]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ seasonally ♥</b> twice yearly<sup id="cite_ref-303" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-303">[303]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Sources do not indicate whether an audience was present.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ [2-3] ♥</b> hours.

Other monks exemplify the teachings by living an imitation of the Buddha’s own life, gaining insight through ascetic rigour and meditation. The duty of the laity, including the ruler, is to sustain the monkhood by patronage and protection. The enthusiasm for Theravada in the Chao Phraya basin, as elsewhere, stemmed especially from urban society’s appreciation of its openness and inherent egalitarianism: all have the same opportunity to become a monk, to give the monkhood their patronage, and to achieve the ultimate release from the material world (nibbana).

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another.
