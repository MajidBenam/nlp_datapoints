This period began following the destruction of many Minoan sites around 1450, due either to natural catastrophes or human agency[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_GrCrMPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrMPa], and it ended with the destruction of Knossos[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_GrCrMPa] Throughout this period, Knossos was the main political, administrative and economic centre of the island: analyses of both textual and archaeological data shows that Knossos controlled a series of second-order (e.g. Kydonia and Phaistos) and third-order (e.g. Tylissos) centers[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_GrCrMPa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_GrCrMPa]. However, a resurgence of elite display at second-order sites, starting in 1370, suggests a possible power shift in the final decades of this era, and the decline of Knossian influence over the island[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_GrCrMPa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and Political Organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The supreme leader of the state was the king, known as <i>wanax</i>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_GrCrMPa] He presided over the political, economic and religious  hierarchy.

Palatial institutions were seen as the only regulators of any economic transaction. Acting as redistributive agents, they were thought to draw upon raw materials and labour from the hinterland in order to produce and distribute specialized artisanal goods.  In recent years, however, new perspectives have effectively challenged not only the redistributive role of governing institutions but also the negative attitude towards the existence of market and market-like systems in the Aegean. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_GrCrMPa] Once people started looking for them, markets have begun to appear in much earlier chronological horizons, shaping the emergence of state administrative institutions. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_GrCrMPa] ( Garraty and Stark 2010).

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_GrCrMPa] Weapons, deposited as burial offerings in graves of the military aristocracy -the finest examples were found in the Knossian cemeteries - or offered as votives in the Sanctuary of Syme, are more durable and effective than before. The offensive equipment consist of swords, spears, javelins, bows and slings. The swords are shorter than before and their blade is reinforced with a middle rib.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_GrCrMPa] This new type of sword (Type B) was of medium length, equipped with  a longer tang and slightly wider blade reinforced with a middle rib. The other type of sword (Type C) had two cruciform projections projecting from the hilt in order to provide protection for the hand. Experimental archaeology has show that these two types were designed for different fighting styles. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_GrCrMPa]  The handle of Type C sword allows a fencing style of fight while the handle of Type D sword allows more cutting actions. Both types were used from ca. 1450 to 1300 BCE. Spearheads -the best preserved examples are recovered at the Warrior Graves at Knossos- are narrow, leaf-shaped blade with a strongly marked midrib and a socketed base. This type of spear could be used by both infantry and by chariot warriors. Evidence for javelins, the archaeological data is meagre, is provided by two small fresco fragments from Knossos. The first, named by Evans as the "Captain of the Blacks" fresco -the fresco is heavily restored- portray an African striding quickly behind a male figure holding to light javelins. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_GrCrMPa] The second known as the "Warriors Hurling Javelins"  fresco depicts javelin-armed light infantry. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_GrCrMPa] Although bows were not preserved, representational evidence and arrowheads suggest that this offensive weapon was widely used. The earliest arrowheads were made of flint band obsidian while bronze ones started appeared during the 15th century BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_GrCrMPa] About 110 bronze arrowheads were found at Knossos while a single tablet from the Knossian archive records 8,640 arrowheads. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_GrCrMPa] The charred remains of two wooden boxes containing carbonized arrow-shafts and arrow-heads were found in the "Armoury" of the palace at Knossos. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_GrCrMPa] Slings, initially used for hunting, had acquired a military role by the 15th century BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_GrCrMPa] Sling bullets were initially rounded stones and pebbles but towards the end of the Mycenaean period lead bullets also appeared. The defensive equipment includes helmets, body armor, greaves and shields. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_GrCrMPa]  The most common helmet is the so-called boar's tusk helmet made by a series of small boar's tusks sewn onto a cup-shaped piece of leather or felt in alternating rows. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_GrCrMPa] These helmets were used from ca. 1650 to 1150 BCE. They were depicted on frescoes -a very fine example was found at Thera - seals, and metal vessels. Bronze helmets with a plume knob and two cheek guards that were sewn onto the bowl were also know from the Warrior Graves at Knossos.  Helmets were recorded in Linear B tablets. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_GrCrMPa] Bronze body armors are mentioned in Linear B tablets from Knossos, either in the form of ideograms  or with the word <i>to rake</i>. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_GrCrMPa] Evans  regarded the corset ideogram as representing "a form of body-armour consisting of horizontal plates of metal, presumably backed by leather or linen, and suspended from shoulder-pieces of a similar fashion." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_GrCrMPa] The best preserved example is the impressive bronze cuirass found in an early Mycenaean tomb at Dendra in the Argolid. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_GrCrMPa] The evidence for scale armors is extremely scanty; only two scale plates are know from the Aegean and it is not certain if this type of body armor, typical in the Near East, was used in Mycenaean Greece. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_GrCrMPa] Greaves were made from a thin braze sheet and worn over a legging of linen, leather or felt. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_GrCrMPa] It seems, however, that bronze greaves were not widely used and warriors preferred to wore linen or leather leggings. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_GrCrMPa] The evidence for shields exclusively derives from representations. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_GrCrMPa] Two are the main type of shields: the "figure-of-eight" shield and the "tower" shield. Both types cover the warrior from neck to toe. They were probably made of several layers of oxhide and a wicker frame. Large "figure-of-eight" wall-painted shields decorated the Grand Staircase of the palace of Knossos. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_GrCrMPa] Linear B texts from the Knossian archive are particularly informative on war chariots. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_GrCrMPa] The tablets were found in the <i>Armoury Building</i> of the palace and record more than 120 chariots with wheels and at least 237 in a non assembled state.  They also record a total number of over a thousand pairs of wheels. The most common type of chariot  was the "dual chariot", used between 1450-1200 BCE. The chariot had two four-spoked wheels and a single pole. Its cab is furnished with curved side extensions at the rear. The sidings and wings were usually covered with oxhide or leather. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_GrCrMPa] Many theories have been proposed regarding the way these chariots were used.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_GrCrMPa] It has been argued that chariots were used as archery platforms, as vehicle to take warriors to and from battle, or used by heavy armed spearmen charged headlong at each other in mass formation. The lack of evidence for protection of the chariots indicates that chariots "were not designed to appear in the tick of battle, or even to come with range of emery missiles".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_GrCrMPa]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Military_Technologies">Military Technologies</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=GrCrMPa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24" title="Edit section: Military Technologies">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Javelins ♣ present♥</b>Evidence for javelins, the archaeological data is meagre, is provided by two small fresco fragments from Knossos.

Many sites went out of use or show only a scatter of pottery, as at Arkalochori and Kamares (Kanta 1980: 80, 112). It is clear at Juktas and Kato Symi, and likely at Psychro, that there was no brake in activity, but the same cannot be presumed for other sites from which both LM I and LM III types have been reported. Indeed, some peak sanctuaries apparently being used in LM III (Peatfield 1983: 278) have produced no LM I material; their revival may reflect the increasing provincialism in Crete that followed the destruction of many new LM III cult sites (some clearly LM IIIB). The continuing use of the Knossos palace involved the use if many of its rooms for ritual or ceremony purposes, but overall polythyra, "lustral basins", and "pillar crypts" seem to have lost significance.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_GrCrMPa] There is a similar picture in the evidence for rituals. Some types of item apparently ceased to be made, such as 'libation tables' and most stone ritual vessels, although older pieces could continue in use, as particularly in the Knossos Central Palace Sanctuary; this must have had an effect at sites like Kato Symi, where they had been common before. Yet there was also a considerable element of continuity: basic forms of ritual such as sacrifice, libation, and the offering of figurines and other items certainly continued. The clear evidence for animal sacrifice from Archanes T. A (Sakellarakis 1991: 76-7), best interpreted as part of the burial ritual for a special individual, seems to represent a continuation or adaptation of Minoan traditions rather than a newly introduced rite. The palace frescoes, a larnax from Knossos )Morgan 1987), the famous Ayia Triada sarcophagus with scenes of sacrifice and libation (Pl. 8.3), seal-ring and seal-stones all show rituals or religious themes in a essentially Minoan style. Similarly, in the Linear B texts concerning offerings of olive oil and other substances, the unspecific offering to 'all the gods' or to apparently sacred places and shrines (most if not all close to Knossos, according to Killen 1987), and the prominence of 'priestesses of the winds' seem highly liley to preserve elements of the pervious period, as does the occurrence of peculiar, apparently divine names here and elsewhere (Chadwick 1976: 100)."  It is not clear how far any of the changes are attributable to the new "Mycenaean" ruling class of Knossos. the survival or abandonment of major sites and the disappearance of inscribed dedications should reflect decisions at palace level. The term "potnia", of patently Indo-European origin, meaning "lady" or "mistress", might have been introduced from the mainland, but no identifiably Greek divine names are prominent in the texts, although several occur once or twice; but the reference to "Diktaian Zeus" is a noteworthy example of syncretism with a probably important local cult (particularly if Dikte was Petsopha, in a region generally thought to be outside the political control of the Knossos state). The griffins in the Throne Room fresco have been argued to reflect specifically Mycenaean iconography, but the general associations of the throne and frescoes seem Minoan (Niemeier 1987: 167). The prominence of males in the Procession Fresco may reflect a new social order, but they are led by, and are apparently paying respect to, female figures (cf. Boulotis 1987; Cameron 1987: 323, fig. 6). <i>The overall impression gained, especially from the pictorial material, is of a wish to fit with with established traditions</i> [the emphasis is mine]."

The present coding reflects the personal view of the coder, though this view is both supported by existing evidence and by our experts [MAJIDBENAM_REF_102_GrCrMPa]. The bull was identified with the Minoan world. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_103_GrCrMPa] Its indissoluble relationship to ritual does not merely highlight aspects of religious expression but also projects the political ideal of the palatial system, the sovereign power of the ruling group. The frequent depiction of bull-leaping, especially in the palatial context of Knossos, does not simply express the human attempt to tame nature, personified in the dynamic figure of the charging bull. Apart from the tension evoked by life-and-death situations, human mastery over the wild powers of nature is symbolic of the mastery of the ruling class, ensuring social cohesion and the preservation of the social hierarchy. The battle with the bull functions, above all, as a token of political dominance, which metaphorically reproduces the authority of the ruler. In this context, the depiction of bull-leaping scenes in the frescoes decorating the walls of, exclusively, the palace of Knossos, displays the dominant role of that palace. It is obviously no coincidence that the myth of the Minotaur, the monster with the body of a man and the head of a bull, was identified with Knossos and its Labyrinth, the reference-point of the Minoan world. The emblematic character of the bull was reinforced during the Neopalatial period and reached its peak in the pictorial decoration of the palace of Knossos. The power and masculinity of the bull inspired the execution of dangerous acrobatics with a bull in the context of bull-leaping games. In a display of physical strength, courage and even human dominance, young athletes attempted to leap over the back of a charging bull and land on their feet on the ground. The sport, in which both men and women participated, is attested as early as the Prepalatial period and continued to be performed in the same way throughout the Minoan era. It is depicted in a multitude of scenes in many different art-forms, demonstrating the powerful influence it exercised on wide social strata due to its spectacular nature and the high degree of risk for the athletes involved. The most characteristic and detailed scenes are those in a series of wall paintings, known as the “Taureador Frescoes”, from the palace of Knossos (1600-1400 BC). The fit male acrobat, his gender indicated by his dark brown skin, uses the bull's momentum to leap between its horns and flip over its back, landing behind it. In order to protect himself from the bull's horns as far as possible, he is aided by two people, presumably assistants, who hold onto the horns to slow the animal down and prevent it tossing its head dangerously, while a third helper waits behind the bull to catch the athlete as he lands. In bull-leaping depictions the acrobat's assistants are young women, perhaps adolescents, as indicated by their small breasts and their white skin, always a female attribute. In the unrestored scenes mentioned above, athletes are seen falling to the ground after unsuccessful leaps, highlighting the risks involved in the sport. Many condensed bull-leaping scenes are found on a series of seal impressions made by gold or silver signet rings, mainly from Hagia Triada and Sklavokambos, and on seals of various materials. This demonstrates both the great popularity of the spectacle and its use by senior officials and inspectors of the palatial bureaucracy, particularly that of Knossos. Knossos has also provided further bull-leaping images. One is actually three-dimensional: the famous ivory acrobat in mid-leap, originally part of a group, of which limbs and two heads of bull-leapers have been preserved. A similar group, in a very fragmentary state, was found during the excavation of the “Royal Road” between the palace and the “Little Palace” at Knossos. An exceptionally delicate bull-leaping scene on a rock-crystal plaque is a masterpiece of Minoan miniature art. The capture of the bull in the wild is associated, pictorially and perhaps also in fact, with the sport of bull-leaping, as a series of images shows. In Minoan-style scenes on two gold cups from Vapheio in Laconia, a wild bull is caught in a net tied between two trees. In another scene, a charging bull tosses two “hunters” who are, however, unarmed. The roles are reversed here - the bull is probably the hunter and the men the hunted. Their spectacular tumble, dangerous to life and limb, recalls the failed leaps and falls depicted in the frescoes of Knossos and Avaris.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> Speculative, but supported by the following quote.

However, it does seem that ritualised drinking was practiced very often. "While drinking and feasting can be detected from the Early Bronze Age (as indicated by the appearance of drinking vessels), it seems that it becomes more intense from the end of that phase and continuous through the first palace period, reaching its peak in the neopalatial period. This is the period when most evidence for wine production is found, as well as the period which is characterized by an explosion in the elaboration of material culture, the establishment of many buildings which imitate palatial styles and replicate their function, some in close proximity to each other (as in the area around Knossos), and the production of masses of drinking and serving vessels, with the conical cup as the most common shape. Such vessels are found in many hundreds and thousands and are mostly plain, indicating mass production (Table 1). This is also the period with the most evidence for ritualized consumption, as indicated by the large number of structured depositions of drinking cups, sometimes accompanied by other feasting evidence (Hamilakis 1995). Pottery production, especially of drinking vessels, shows trends of standardization, with the number of drinking shapes decreasing as the percentage of drinking-vessels increases (Table 1), indicating mass production." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_GrCrMPa] "I have suggested (Hamilakis 1995,1996) that this picture, which can also be seen with variations in other social arenas such as mortuary feasting (Hamilakis 1998a), may indicate complex social interactions characterized by intense competition for retinue and resources. Wine production may have been adopted as an elite distinction mechanism imitating 'oriental' customs (Sherratt and Sherratt 1991), but it must also have been triggered by the need for alcohol consumption in feasting and other social gatherings that intensify from the end of the Early Bronze Age, as elites were stepping up competition for authority and control. This process of competition is much more evident in the neopalatial period, where, I have suggested, a process of intense factionalism can be identified, with the many palatial centres operating as centres of competitive consumption, with feasting and drinking cere- monies as one of its main features (Hamilakis 1995,1997-8; cf.

However, it does seem that ritualised drinking was practiced very often. "While drinking and feasting can be detected from the Early Bronze Age (as indicated by the appearance of drinking vessels), it seems that it becomes more intense from the end of that phase and continuous through the first palace period, reaching its peak in the neopalatial period. This is the period when most evidence for wine production is found, as well as the period which is characterized by an explosion in the elaboration of material culture, the establishment of many buildings which imitate palatial styles and replicate their function, some in close proximity to each other (as in the area around Knossos), and the production of masses of drinking and serving vessels, with the conical cup as the most common shape. Such vessels are found in many hundreds and thousands and are mostly plain, indicating mass production (Table 1). This is also the period with the most evidence for ritualized consumption, as indicated by the large number of structured depositions of drinking cups, sometimes accompanied by other feasting evidence (Hamilakis 1995). Pottery production, especially of drinking vessels, shows trends of standardization, with the number of drinking shapes decreasing as the percentage of drinking-vessels increases (Table 1), indicating mass production." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_150_GrCrMPa] "I have suggested (Hamilakis 1995,1996) that this picture, which can also be seen with variations in other social arenas such as mortuary feasting (Hamilakis 1998a), may indicate complex social interactions characterized by intense competition for retinue and resources. Wine production may have been adopted as an elite distinction mechanism imitating 'oriental' customs (Sherratt and Sherratt 1991), but it must also have been triggered by the need for alcohol consumption in feasting and other social gatherings that intensify from the end of the Early Bronze Age, as elites were stepping up competition for authority and control. This process of competition is much more evident in the neopalatial period, where, I have suggested, a process of intense factionalism can be identified, with the many palatial centres operating as centres of competitive consumption, with feasting and drinking cere- monies as one of its main features (Hamilakis 1995,1997-8; cf. Brumfiel 1987,1989; Brumfiel and Fox 1994)."

In Minoan theological thought, the goddess descends from the heavens. Prayers, invocations, ceremonial dances and other sacred acts were intended to bring about her appearance from on high to bless her worshippers and alleviate human suffering. Doves or larger birds, or even mythological beings, accompanied her on her journey from heaven to earth. Scenes on sealstones and signet rings depict the different stages of the epiphany, forming impressive, poetic compositions. The intensity of the goddess's descent is stressed by her long, waving locks, while a rod-shaped sceptre is usually displayed as a symbol of authority by the young god. Often, specific ritual actions combined with typical features of the Cretan landscape, such as pulling the sacred tree or embracing a natural stone, hint at a mythological background associated with the deity worshipped, which is enacted in the form of a dance drama. The heavenly epiphany of the Minoan deities contributed to the location of cult on mountain peaks and low hills, in humble sanctuaries with few built structures. Simple countryfolk and townspeople alike made offerings of small human or animal figurines deposited in cracks in the rocks, invoking divine aid for the fertility of soil, flocks and herds, or for healing. Clay models of human limbs and other body parts functioned in a similar way to modern Greek votive offerings, indicating the afflicted area. The huge numbers of figurines and other offerings found at the peak sanctuaries of Juktas, Kophinas, Petsophas, Traostalos, Piskokephalo and Vrysinas demonstrate the religious sentiment of local communities. The gestures of the human figurines, in particular, express the pleas of the faithful for the god's blessing and awe before the deity. The arms may be folded on the breast or cover the face, protecting the worshipper from the light accompanying the revelation of the divine. The nature goddess was worshipped not only at the peak sanctuaries but also at open-air sanctuaries and sacred caves. A unique case of an extensive complex of supralocal character is the open-air sanctuary at Syme Viannou. The abundant votives and vessels of the open-air cult, centred on a sacred enclosure with a raised platform, highlight the special significance of the sanctuary throughout the Minoan period. Secondary residential areas for the priesthood bear witness to the organisation of the official cult. Open-air spaces functioned as the ideal backdrop for widely attended religious enactments, while elements of the Cretan landscape, such as the typical vegetation and natural rocks, formed the focus of ritual behaviours invested with a specific ideological content. However, the palatial management of the religious ceremonies, especially those centred on the epiphany, was indissolubly linked to the renewal of royal power and the imposition of a specific system of religious values, serving the political ideology of the dominant ruling class.

The present coding reflects the personal view of the coder, though this view is both supported by existing evidence and by our experts [MAJIDBENAM_REF_217_GrCrMPa]. The bull was identified with the Minoan world. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_218_GrCrMPa] Its indissoluble relationship to ritual does not merely highlight aspects of religious expression but also projects the political ideal of the palatial system, the sovereign power of the ruling group. The frequent depiction of bull-leaping, especially in the palatial context of Knossos, does not simply express the human attempt to tame nature, personified in the dynamic figure of the charging bull. Apart from the tension evoked by life-and-death situations, human mastery over the wild powers of nature is symbolic of the mastery of the ruling class, ensuring social cohesion and the preservation of the social hierarchy. The battle with the bull functions, above all, as a token of political dominance, which metaphorically reproduces the authority of the ruler. In this context, the depiction of bull-leaping scenes in the frescoes decorating the walls of, exclusively, the palace of Knossos, displays the dominant role of that palace. It is obviously no coincidence that the myth of the Minotaur, the monster with the body of a man and the head of a bull, was identified with Knossos and its Labyrinth, the reference-point of the Minoan world. The emblematic character of the bull was reinforced during the Neopalatial period and reached its peak in the pictorial decoration of the palace of Knossos. The power and masculinity of the bull inspired the execution of dangerous acrobatics with a bull in the context of bull-leaping games. In a display of physical strength, courage and even human dominance, young athletes attempted to leap over the back of a charging bull and land on their feet on the ground. The sport, in which both men and women participated, is attested as early as the Prepalatial period and continued to be performed in the same way throughout the Minoan era. It is depicted in a multitude of scenes in many different art-forms, demonstrating the powerful influence it exercised on wide social strata due to its spectacular nature and the high degree of risk for the athletes involved. The most characteristic and detailed scenes are those in a series of wall paintings, known as the “Taureador Frescoes”, from the palace of Knossos (1600-1400 BC). The fit male acrobat, his gender indicated by his dark brown skin, uses the bull's momentum to leap between its horns and flip over its back, landing behind it. In order to protect himself from the bull's horns as far as possible, he is aided by two people, presumably assistants, who hold onto the horns to slow the animal down and prevent it tossing its head dangerously, while a third helper waits behind the bull to catch the athlete as he lands. In bull-leaping depictions the acrobat's assistants are young women, perhaps adolescents, as indicated by their small breasts and their white skin, always a female attribute. In the unrestored scenes mentioned above, athletes are seen falling to the ground after unsuccessful leaps, highlighting the risks involved in the sport. Many condensed bull-leaping scenes are found on a series of seal impressions made by gold or silver signet rings, mainly from Hagia Triada and Sklavokambos, and on seals of various materials. This demonstrates both the great popularity of the spectacle and its use by senior officials and inspectors of the palatial bureaucracy, particularly that of Knossos. Knossos has also provided further bull-leaping images. One is actually three-dimensional: the famous ivory acrobat in mid-leap, originally part of a group, of which limbs and two heads of bull-leapers have been preserved. A similar group, in a very fragmentary state, was found during the excavation of the “Royal Road” between the palace and the “Little Palace” at Knossos. An exceptionally delicate bull-leaping scene on a rock-crystal plaque is a masterpiece of Minoan miniature art. The capture of the bull in the wild is associated, pictorially and perhaps also in fact, with the sport of bull-leaping, as a series of images shows. In Minoan-style scenes on two gold cups from Vapheio in Laconia, a wild bull is caught in a net tied between two trees. In another scene, a charging bull tosses two “hunters” who are, however, unarmed. The roles are reversed here - the bull is probably the hunter and the men the hunted. Their spectacular tumble, dangerous to life and limb, recalls the failed leaps and falls depicted in the frescoes of Knossos and Avaris.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> Speculative, but supported by the following quote.

I imagine that sacrificing the bull would have formed a fitting close to the bull-games. The sacrifice of bulls is well illustrated and has received much attention; it undoubtedly occurred often during several kinds of rituals, including funeral rites and perhaps hero/ancestor worship. And there are some pieces of circumstantial evidence for relating bull-sacrifice to the bull-games. The garlands around the netted bull-rhyta should indicate the sacral character of captured bulls, emphasized by the loose garlands that some athletes wore; the Phaistos bull-leaping stand (if that's what it was) also had a sacral character at times, as the sacrificial trau found atop it testifies.

On the one hand, it involved the transfer of collective rituals, based on the communal consumption of food and drink, and on ritual interments, inside the palaces, with the explicit purpose of integrating forms of religious practice already established in the surrounding territory. On the other hand, in the context of a social strategy designed to reinforce the power of the dominant groups, it led to the creation of a palace religion. This received a decisive impulse from the importation of objects, ideas, beliefs and symbols from the Near East. The elites involved in this process were seeking 'to claim affinity with distant elites and represent themselves at a local level as qualitatively different beings'. From now onwards, and up to the end of the Bronze Age, the groups that controlled the palace system worked to achieve a progressive concentration of the exploitation of sacrality as a means of exercising social control."
