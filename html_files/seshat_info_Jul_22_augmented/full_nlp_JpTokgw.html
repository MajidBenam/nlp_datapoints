Sekigahara in 1600 which marked the start of his rise to power. Tokugawa Ieyasu  reinstated the Shogunate when the title was conferred on him in 1603 by Emperor Go-Yozei (the title had been unused since 1588). Although the Emperor remained as official head of state the Tokugawa Shoguns ruled Japan. The period ends with fall of the Shogunate and  the restoration of the Emperor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_JpTokgw] 'This period is sometimes dated from 1600 to reflect the significance of the decisive victory of the Tokugawa at the Battle of Sekigahara. Alternately, the Edo period is sometimes dated from 1603, the year that Tokugawa Ieyasu became shogun. Finally, some date the Edo period from 1616, the year of Ieyasu’s death. The Edo period ended in 1867 with the resignation of the last Tokugawa shogun, or according to others, in 1868 when the imperial restoration (Meiji Restoration) was proclaimed and the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo (“Eastern Capital”), replacing Kyoto as the official capital of Japan.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_JpTokgw]   The Tokugawa  shogunate was capable of ‘exerting nationwide enforcement over military and fiscal institutions’, however, the daimyo still held considerable administrative authority and maintained their own armies. ‘although in theory they [daimyo] were allowed considerable autonomy in matters such as taxation rights and internal administration, including law enforcement, in practice they were expected to follow the examples and guidelines established by the shogunate.  In effect, local government became their responsibility, and they had to carry out their responsibilities to the shogunates’s liking.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Japan - Azuchi-Momoyama ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> Regime change.

Sometimes the slightly earlier start date of 1600 is chosen in recognition of Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara; however, we have selected the 1603 date, which marks his official appointment as shogun. Although the emperor remained the official head of state, the Tokugawa shoguns ruled Japan. The rise to power of the Tokugawa Shogunate marked an end to the internal strife and warfare that had characterized the preceding century. Tokugawa Ieyasu and his immediate successors set about limiting the power of their rivals and instituting new policies aimed at maintaining stability and centralizing Japan's government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The 'peak' of the Tokugawa period corresponds to the years between 1688 and 1704 CE, known as the Genroku period, which saw the development of a distinct urban culture and the proliferation of art, theatre and fiction.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_JpTokgw] During the early modern period the Japanese polity consisted of three major islands: Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Eventually, economic difficulties and the threat of Western encroachment helped to bring about the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The period came to an end with the resignation of the last Tokugawa shogun in 1867 and the imperial restoration in 1868.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Tokugawa shogunate built on the work of the generals Oda Nobunaga (1534-1582 CE) and Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-1598 CE), who between 1568 and 1590 succeeded in uniting all the daimyō (local military lords) under the command of a military leader into a 'national confederation'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_JpTokgw] Theoretically, the daimyō maintained administrative authority in their own territories, but in practice they were expected to follow the guidance of the shogunate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_JpTokgw] Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors pursued a policy of 'orthodoxy and stability',[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_JpTokgw] aimed at consolidating their own power and limiting the ability of their rivals to amass enough power or wealth to enable them to challenge the shogunate. The success of these policies enabled the Tokugawa family to preside over a period of peace and prosperity and rule Japan for the next 268 years.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_JpTokgw] As well as peace, political stability and the centralization of power by the shoguns, the Tokugawa period was characterized by economic prosperity, rising urbanization and the closings of Japan's borders to the wider world in the 1630s.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Theoretically, class was determined by birth and social mobility was prohibited. Influenced by Chinese models, the social order was formalized and essentially frozen in a hierarchy known as <i>shi-nō-kō-shō</i>, 'warrior-peasant-artisan-merchant'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpTokgw] Despite the shogunate's concerted attempts to maintain a strict social orthodoxy, however, the stable and economically prosperous conditions led to a range of social changes, including increasing urbanization and the rise of the merchant class, who (although they were theoretically socially inferior) now held much of the country's wealth.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpTokgw] Now that there was no need for the majority of those of samurai rank to be actively engaged in military activities, the warrior class became bureaucratized, a development that went hand-in-hand with a romanticization of the warrior ideal and the codification of proper rules of behaviour.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Tokugawa period, population censuses were carried out. However, they did not take all members of the population into account and various scholars have therefore used supplementary data to produce what they hope are more accurate estimates.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpTokgw] Estimates for the beginning of the period (1600 CE) range from around 15[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpTokgw] to 22[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpTokgw] million.

Although shields could withstand more force if each was made from a single board, this was the exception rather than the rule.

In addition, the neck was shielded by a series of three or five metal plates. By the end of the Muromachi period, most ordinary helmets were made from iron and/or steel. The helmet was formed from individual plates fastened with rivets or simply joined together. The top portion of the helmet, shaped like the pate of a human head, was called the hachi. In the early medieval period, from the 11th to 14th centuries, hachi were almost invariably rounded.'

Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the sixth century from the Asian mainland and quickly became the religion of the aristocrats and the imperial family, thus assuming political significance. It was not until Japan’s medieval period that Buddhism became broadly diffused throughout Japanese society.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_242_JpTokgw] ‘Although individual Japanese religions can be discussed, it is important to bear in mind that in many periods of Japanese history—including the medieval and early modern—distinctions between traditions were not very sharply drawn. This was true both in terms of a person’s worship and in terms of Japanese culture more generally.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_243_JpTokgw] ‘in medieval and early modern Japan, practice was far more central to religious identity than was any profession of faith.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_244_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Religious rituals, though directed to numerous different ends, were often intended for life cycle events such as birth, marriage, and death. Religion was often intimately connected to the everyday, rather than directed beyond daily life. Festivals, too, celebrated various key events in the life of a community. Festivals were held in celebration of the harvest, the New Year, and to honor the spirits of the dead. Both rituals and festivals were methods of personal purification, showing appreciation for the fertility of the land, making offerings to honor the gods, Buddhas, and ancestors, requesting help in troubled times, and seeking the welfare of the community.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_245_JpTokgw] ‘in medieval and early modern Japan, a very close connection between religion and the state was deemed both proper and necessary. Though there are exceptions, religion was often treated as ancillary to politics. Used to create national identity, religion served the nation as a means of providing legitimacy for political arrangements current at any given time. Japan’s national myth, that Japan was created from the sacred acts of the kami whose descendants form the imperial line, is one such use of religion to justify political power. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR] ‘Annual observances celebrated at the imperial court beginning in the Heian period (794-1185[CE]) differed radically from those held in farm villages. Whereas court ceremonies derived in large part from Chinese customs, village rituals tended to be indigenous and related to rice agriculture.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_247_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Shinto</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Unlike many religions, Shinto has no founder and does not view any single text as its sole scripture. Shinto is closely associated with the Japanese sense of cultural identity. Shinto emphasizes practice over thought or formal doctrine. There is not a formal Shinto theology or rigidly codified set of moral rules. Shinto is intimately connected with the agricultural cycle and a sense of the sacredness of the natural world. The worship of kami and other ritual practices express these concerns... Ritual practice is central to Shinto traditions and includes such activities as purification, food  offerings, dance, and festivals honoring the gods. While kami may be worshipped at shrines under the supervision of Shinto priests (kannushi), they can also be worshipped individually at a shrine or in the home. Further, Shinto associations (ko) provide yet another avenue for interaction with the kami.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_248_JpTokgw] ‘On the one hand, Shinto describes an organized set of doctrines and practices related to the state. This perspective on Shinto is strongly tied to the mythology and founding stories of the imperial family, especially as expressed in theKojiki (Record of ancient matters, compiled in 712). Shinto was important to the legitimating narratives by which the imperial family justified its right to rule. This aspect of Shinto was conspicuous for the rituals performed expressing the intimate connection between emperor and kami.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_249_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘But it was only during the period under consideration [Tokugawa] that religion came to penetrate the lives of the general populace, not just as a primitive faith, but also as a system of beliefs that had undergone considerable intellectual refinement while sustained by the teachings and rituals of Buddhism and Shinto. The same period saw the establishment of a common religious institution throughout the country. And it is the spread of a common pattern of religious practice both geographically and socially that can be cited as evidence of the establishment of a national religion.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_250_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b> Buddhism</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Buddhism originated in India and spread to China about four centuries after the time of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni (ca. fifth to fourth century, B.C.). It was transmitted to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula around the middle of the sixth century.1 The cultural gulf that existed at that time between Japan on the one hand and China and Korea on the other was considerable. Japan's ruling class accepted Buddhism as the embodiment of an advanced and superior civilization, and in order to gain control over the concepts and technology that Buddhism brought to Japan, the elite provided a succession of large temples where Buddhism could put down roots.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_251_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'it was in the Kamakura period that Buddhism in Japan came into full flower. The forms of Buddhism that emerged at that time - Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren - were largely responsible for the dissemination of Buddhist beliefs and practices throughout Japanese society. The success of this movement lay in tailoring the ideas and goals of Buddhism to the concerns of the populace at large. Hence, Kamakura Buddhism, as the entire religious movement is called, has left an indelible mark on Japanese history and has made Buddhism a lasting and pervasive component of Japanese culture.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_252_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'From the end of the twelfth century through the middle of the thirteenth - that is, in the first half of the Kamakura period - some of Japan's foremost religious figures appeared, in quick succession. The schools of Buddhism that today claim them as their founders have long had considerable influence in Japan. From their inception in the Kamakura period, these schools stood as a separate religious movement from the eight schools that existed before them. These new schools came to be known collectively as Kamakura Buddhism. The establishment of Kamakura Buddhism was a pivotal event in Japanese history, because through it Buddhism was adapted to Japanese ways and thus made accessible to the common people.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_253_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'The various groups that arose out of Kamakura Buddhism generated formal religious organizations during the Muromachi period. From that time on, they have been the most powerful schools of Buddhism in Japan. In reflecting on their origins, all of these schools hark back to the Kamakura period as their institutional starting point, and they claim a continuous and unbroken existence since that time.'

"Divine retribution (shinbatsu) also preserved the religious decorum of the pilgrimage. While the roads leading to Ise were often a bedlam of noise and confusion, once the pilgrims reached the precincts of the Grand Shrine, silence reigned. In 1830, however, a group of pilgrims from Omi created a scene in front of the shrines, singing in loud voices and hurling insults at one another. When they refused to heed the warnings of the officials at the shrine, their leader suffered a mysterious seizure and fell to the ground. When the others saw this, they turned pale and ran off. Thus traditional respect for the shrines was maintained in the midst of what otherwise might have become an unholy uproar." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_255_JpTokgw] It is not entirely clear which rituals, exactly, were carried out at the shrine once it was reached by the pilgrimage, but the following may be relevant. "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami."

Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_285_JpTokgw] For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson [MAJIDBENAM_REF_286_JpTokgw], that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul).

The <i>norito</i> is recited, the staff purified for the day, and announcements made about the day's events and duties." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_332_JpTokgw] "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami."

"Dancers carrying open umbrellas were accompanied by gongs, bells, shamisens, and drums. Enormous amounts of money were spent on fanciful costumes, elaborate ornaments, and banners made out of velvet, damask, and other expensive materials. One source tells us that the Ise-odori resembled the dances of the <i>gannin-bozu</i>, lower-class mendicant priests who went about reciting ballads, riddles, or nonsense sutras for a small handout. Geishas from the cities were sometimes hired by community leaders to teach the dances to the country folk. On the Tokaido roads, most of the dancers were underlings and servants attached to the post stations. The dancing that broke out in Yamato was largely confined to young men and women in their late teens. Many of these dances--ecstatic as they might have been--were methodically organized by community leaders. When this was the case, participation often became mandatory. Usually, rich farmers and merchants were expected to pick up the tab. In Itami, dances were carefully rehearsed and then performed before local shrines. After that, the dancers went throughout the entire region performing in a total of thirty-eight other communities. Dance contests (<i>odori-sumo</i>) were also held between villages." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_368_JpTokgw] "The <i>okage-mairi</i> was accompanied by ecstatic dances, such as <i>Ise-odori</i>, <i>okage-odori</i> and <i>ee-ja-nai-ka</i> (ain't it hunky-dory) that disrupted daily life and work for long periods. Those dances were reminiscent of carnivals, since they were combined with elaborate ornaments and fanciful costumes made of expensive materials.

Therefore, most martial traditions had an oath (kishomon) sealed in blood (keppan), in which the prospective member made certain promises. Some schools required keppan upon entry, some after a probationary period, and some near the end of one’s training when one was about to receive licensure. [...] Let us consider such an oath, that of Araki-ryu: There is really no need for a wider sampling because such oaths, in the Edo period, had to take into consideration the laws of the realm, and so they all read rather similarly. ‘Araki-ryu Kishomon Mae Gaki no Koto/Introductory Vow Before Study: (1) What you do within Araki-ryu must be shown to no one: not even your parents, your brother, nor your family; (2) You must not engage in fights or even sparring with thos of other ryu, not even with your associate students; (3) You must never be rude nor without propriety at the place of practice, nor should you ever lose yourself in drink; (4) Without having received the secrets of kachimi from your teacher, you must never teach anyone; (5) You must not use the logic of Araki-ryu to criticize other ryu; (6) You must hold no evil thoughts towards your teacher. This vow is made to the deities Boten Taishakuten Shidaitenno narabi. Dai Nihon Kokuchu Rokuju yo shu Daisho Jingi, and especially Izu Hakone ryosho gongen, Mishima daimyojin, Hachiman daijin, Tenman Daijizai daijin, burui kenzoku, shin-batsu myobatsu kaku makari koburu baki mono nari. You will be cursed in heaven and earth if you break this vow.’ [...] One seals this with one’s blood, inviting punishment at any breaking of the vow. Betraying the promises inherent in the kishomon is a betrayal not only of the teacher/student relationship, but much larger, a betrayal of the ryu: one’s fellow trainees in the microcosm and macrocosm, the generations of teachers and students who passed this on to the student in the present day.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_405_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ 2 ♥</b> in absolute numbers.

Chinese Neo-Confucianism was an elaboration on earlier Confucian thought. [...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Confucianism posits the possibility of a harmonious society based on five human relationships: between lord and subject, father and son, husband and wife, older (brother) and younger (brother), and friend and friend (the only one characterized by mutuality). In each relationship, the former is superior and the latter subordinate, just as heaven (that is, the natural laws of the universe) is superior and Earth is subordinate. This was a rigid structure whereby one was always embedded in an ever-shifting set of unequal, hierarchical relations. Sometimes one was in the superior position, and sometimes in the subordinate position:the emperor is superior to his subjects; a child is subordinate to a parent. For Confucius, harmony exists in the world when people act in the appropriate manner given whatever hierarchical relationship they currently find themselves in. This hierarchy shifts from moment to moment as one goes in and out of different social situations. For Confucius, these relationships and their correct enactment formed the basis of morality and a harmonious society.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"[...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the Edo period, Neo-Confucianism was used, in part, to legitimize the workings of the state and government policies. It was patronized by the Tokugawa shogunate and the daimyo and became the prevailing ethical and philosophical doctrine adopted by the Edo government. Neo-Confucian scholars equated the moral and rational force in society and politics with the cosmos and its natural harmony. The government also officially patronized Neo-Confucian teachings because they provided the guidelines with which to maintain political order and stability. To preserve the utmost control, the shogunate promoted only one orthodox school of Neo-Confucianism, the Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi) school (see below), and banned all others as heterodox teachings.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the five relationships formed the basis of a strict system imposed on every aspect of society, while the educational system became saturated with Neo-Confucian moral and political ideas. By explicitly delineating every social relationship, from the elite rulers to the common people, a bureaucratic system was set in place that promised, in the ideal,a fair and just administration of government, and loyalty from the people in return. Not surprisingly this articulation of the relationship between ruler and ruled often failed to match the ideal." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_474_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the early modern period, Shinto instead of encompassing Buddhism, entered into dialogue with Neo-Confucianism. By this time,Neo-Confucian ideas had become quite important as a way of thinking about ethics and political philosophy. Rather than blend or fuse Shinto with Buddhism some Edo-period Shinto figures reconsidered Shinto in light of Neo-Confucian ideas. In the same way that Shinto and Buddhism had been blended so Neo- Confucian ideas were combined with Shinto ones." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_475_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The role of Buddhism in Edo-period Japan became much more complex than it had been in earlier periods. It was a period in which Buddhism’s primacy as the main way of thinking about the world was challenged by new Shinto movements as well as by the influence of Neo-Confucian ideas onJapanese ways of thinking. Although Japanese Buddhism always had connections to the state and political interests, these associations became quite explicit during the Edo period. In the early 17th century, the Tokugawa shogunate prohibited the teaching of Christianity and later banned nearly all foreign contacts in Japan for fear of the power of the Christian movement.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The government utilized Buddhism as a way to oversee this ban and to enforce its isolationist policies. One way this was accomplished was by forcing Japanese Christians to renounce their Christianity. Buddhist temples were made into bureaucratic offices of the shogunate by the system of shumon aratame, or examination of religious affiliation. This system - called the danka (parishioner) system - required every Japanese family to become registered members of a local temple and to receive a certificate to the effect that they were not Christian. Temples were required to provide this information to the local lord. As the danka system developed other obligatory activities were instituted such as financial support to temples, annual visits to ancestral graves located on temple grounds, and attendance at important temple rituals. In this way Buddhist temples became overseers of the religious lives of its patrons."

It tells the story of the birth of the kami, especially the birth of Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the Japanese imperial family - and by extension the Japanese people - are descended. The narrative tells of how Ninigi no Mikoto, grandson of Amaterasu Omikami, was sent to establish sovereignty over the Japanese islands. It was Ninigi’s great grandson, Jimmu, who became, according to the narrative, the first emperor of Japan. All Japanese emperors are said to descend from this sacred line beginning with Amaterasu. The three regalia - mirror, sword, and jewel - the symbols of imperial ruling authority, are said to have originated with Amaterasu who started the tradition of passing these symbols to each subsequent ruler. In the medieval and early modern periods (in fact, up until 1945), this Kojiki narrative was used to argue the legitimacy of the imperial family as rightful rulers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_477_JpTokgw] The Emperor had and was considered a living embodiment of a divine ancestor: the sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami. Like his daimyo the Shogun also wished to be known as a benevolent ruler (jinkun). This was first based on Buddhist ideas of compassion (jihi) then increasingly the neo-Confucian precepts of benevolent government (jinsi). Christians could play no role in this ideological structure which completely idealised kōdō, or the Way of the Emperor.  Christianity was essentially outlawed and Iemitsu (r. 1623-1651 CE) went as far as to impose extreme restrictions on foreign trade that lasted until 1853 CE.

There, the terms <i>kōdō</i> and <i>kōgaku</i> became linked with the terms kan'nagara (embodying the gods) and <i>akitsumikami</i> (god incarnate), and their use became inseparable from the religious reverence of the divine emperor.

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_507_JpTokgw] Because polygyny was common among the Japanese aristocracy, it seems reasonable to assume that the above quote applies to this polity as well. "Polygamy by both genders was common in the early period, but as time went on, only males were still able to take on ‘other’ wives.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_509_JpTokgw] "Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_510_JpTokgw] As for Neo-Confucianism: "There are a number of terms and concepts that regularly appear in the writings of Edo-period Neo-Confucians. [...] Benevolence (jin) is a fundamental Confucian virtue that is concerned with the fundamentally relational and social nature of Confucian ethics and notions of government. Those who have cultivated benevolence express humanity and compassion through the way they treat other people. A person who has cultivated benevolence is able to act toward others in an altruistic way. The attainment of the virtue of benevolence is also considered transformative in the sense that one cannot be truly moral without it."

This point is captured in one of the central Buddhist virtues: dana, which is ‘giving’ or ‘generosity’. ‘Giving’ creates a win-win situation. Not only is the gift’s recipient benefited but also the gift’s donor - particularly from a Buddhist point of view, since through giving one counters attachment in its deep-seated form of greedy grasping, of not letting-go." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_514_JpTokgw] Because it syncretised with both Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism [MAJIDBENAM_REF_515_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_REF_516_JpTokgw], it seems reasonable to infer that Buddhist and Neo-Confucian stances on certain issues applied to Shinto as well.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> According to Buddhism: "Leading a moral life is seen as having a wider social dimension as well.

Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu (a square cup made of Japanese cypress). The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often becomes a major party with the organizers, the high priest, and other priests present for as long as worshippers remain." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_518_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ morality ♣ present ♥</b> "It is a standard criticism made of Shinto by Western religions that it has no system of ethics similar to Buddhism , Judaism, or Christianity, and consequently it offers no guidance for life. This is also asserted to be evidence of the primitive nature of the tradition. However, to claim that there is no ethical content to Shinto whatsoever is to argue from an inadequate understanding of both Shinto and of how values evolve within a cultural tradition." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_519_JpTokgw] However, in the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, it does seem that at least the more conventional moral values mostly came from Buddhism: "Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions. Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both."

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_582_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions. Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_583_JpTokgw]  According to Buddhism: “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_584_JpTokgw] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_585_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept. Other examples in the Jātakas and elsewhere speak of princes and kings who renounced their thrones rather than resorting to violence to defend their kingdoms.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_589_JpTokgw]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of purity ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ general supernatural enforcement of morality ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2).

Those who have cultivated benevolence express humanity and compassion through the way they treat other people. A person who has cultivated benevolence is able to act toward others in an altruistic way. The attainment of the virtue of benevolence is also considered transformative in the sense that one cannot be truly moral without it." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_595_JpTokgw] In Buddhism: "The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_596_JpTokgw] "Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice."

Honesty is living up to what one says one will do. It means keeping your promises. [...] Sincerity, or integrity, is closely allied to honesty. It means there should be no distance between what we think, what we say, and what we do. In many situations we can find ourselves busy analyzing a situation and what we are looking for is how this situation will harm or benefit ourselves.

The paradigmatic act was performed by Izanagi-no-mikoto when he has escaped from Yomi-nokuni where, according to the mythology recorded in the Nihon Shōki (720), he was visiting his deceased wife. The purpose of purification is to remove tsumi (impurity) and kegare (impurity caused by various human conditions) and restore human nature to its primal and pure state. Thus the idea that human nature can in some sense return to its divine origins lies behind all other related concepts. [...] Human beings are born able to live in harmony with the divine and with nature, but because of the various forms of impurity that overtake life, purification becomes necessary. Hence the importance of purification to effect restoration.// The goal to be achieved by the performance of misogi shuho , purification using water, is the cultivation of reisei , the Shinto ideal of spirituality. As the spirit is purified again and again, it can rise to the level of the divine as its spiritual sensitivity is heightened. The repairing and remaking of the kokoro is called tsukuri katame naosu." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_610_JpTokgw] As for Neo-Confucianism: “Even a first and superficial glance makes it clear that purifying, purification and actions or things that are considered pure play a decisive role in virtually all Chinese religions.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_611_JpTokgw] Because it syncretised with both Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism [MAJIDBENAM_REF_612_JpTokgw][MAJIDBENAM_REF_613_JpTokgw], it seems reasonable to infer that Buddhist and Neo-Confucian stances on certain issues applied to Shinto as well.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> "There are a number of terms and concepts that regularly appear in the writings of Edo-period Neo-Confucians. [...] Filial piety (ko) was the idea that children owe a debt of gratitude to their parents for bringing them into the world and caring for them. Thus, children were to exhibit loyalty and obedience to their parents. In more concrete terms, this meant caring for one’s parents once they became old and infirm, and, upon a parent’s death, to engage in rituals of veneration that conferred the status of ancestor on the deceased. In China, the family was thought of as the basic unit of society and therefore filial piety was considered the foundation that made this social unit work properly. The Japanese also embraced this Confucian notion of filial piety but extended it to apply to the ideal of loyalty to one’s lord. To be loyal was to be filial. As a result, filial piety also resonated with the warrior class and was a way to frame the lord-vassal relationship within the prevailing philo  sophical discourse of the Edo period." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_614_JpTokgw] In Buddhism: "‘Right action’ basically means to act gently and kindly and to be ‘compassionate to all living beings’. What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’."

The military emphasis is crucial. Military service is symbolically the best suited occupation for an embodiment of values primarily oriented to goal-attainment. It typifies selfless devotion to the collectivity and its head, even to the point of death. Death indeed in a military context can come to symbolize that very devotion. Again the achievement aspect of goal-attainment values is well symbolized by the heroic overcoming of difficulties, the execution of 'deeds of outstanding merit' which is the essence of the life of the warrior.

[...] Tsumi included offenses for which a person was responsible as well as calamities over which he or she had no control. Certain acts resulting in bodily harm to others were lumped together with epidemics and natural calamities as forms of tsumi that were referred to as ‘troublesome things’ (magagoto). In general the ancient Japanese equated physical purity and brightness with righteousness and virtue; conversely, physical defilement and darkness were seen as evil and injustice. Ablutions were used as magic rites to eliminate tsumi. The common element that links all tsumi is their danger to the cosmic and social order. The primitive Japanese believed that society and the cosmos were interrelated and that disturbing one could disturb the other. As violations of the normal order of things, tsumi were to be feared because it was thought that they would invite calamity. Improper sexual relations, for instance, might lead to poor harvests. Thus rules for conduct were not based on principles considered inherently moral, and the danger caused by improper actions or unfortunate events might be removed completely by conducting the appropriate magical rites." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_639_JpTokgw] As for Buddhists, they expected rulers to be in charge of punishment, not religious agents. "The Sutra of the Golden Light lists several arguments as to why a king who rules in accordance with the Dharma must punish evil-doers and reward the good: In doing so, he demonstrates the basic principle of karma: good deeds lead to good results and bad deeds to bad ones. In this way the king establishes his subjects in good conduct. Moreover, if a king would overlook evil acts and leave the evil-doers unpunished, lawless conduct would become rife and the use of violence increase. By refraining from punishment, a king would thus support the evil-doers and become directly responsible for the growth of violence in his country. Ultimately, then, non-violence is not really an option, for non-violent rule would in fact lead to even more violence. Nevertheless the king’s motives in employing force must be selfless and lawful, his judgements impartial and the punishment measured to the crime (see Emmerick, 1970, pp. 57- 73)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_640_JpTokgw] No evidence could be found in the literature that Confucian religious agents punished moral transgressors.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Economic_Well-Being">Economic Well-Being</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpTokgw&amp;action=edit&amp;section=71" title="Edit section: Economic Well-Being">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div><b>State Intervention in Economy</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Exchange-houses in Osaka took deposits and loaned out in cash or with a cheque called Furi Tegata, first issued in the 17th century.
