The setting up of these catella led to an agrarian revolution in Italy. ... To establish castella and military settlers meant dividing up these large estates. The method adopted was expropriation without compensation, but the soldiers stationed in the castellum were granted land in the form of an emphyteunsis, that is, hereditary lease. The actual ownership of the land remained with the proprietors and the soldiers had to pay them a fixed annual rent in return. This relationship with the landowners meant that the garrison of the castellum did not form an independent community, for the castellum was established on private property. ... The development of this relationship between the soldiers and the landed proprietors, based on leasehold, was of extreme importance for the West. Under Germanic influence the nature of the emphyteusis began to change and what had been a Roman legal concept now turned into a relationship of vassalage. The relation between soldier and landed proprietor, which from the Roman point of view was regarded as a private contract, began to be interpreted as a relation between lord and vassal. ... the two largest landlords in imperial Italy, the Pope and the archbishop of Ravenna, now became territorial rulers. In the case of the papacy this situtation was given legal validity by the Franks, so that the Pope was at least de jure ruler of the land of which he had formerly been proprietor." <sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Uniformity of equipment ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Total army ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional army ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Largest fielded army ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Maximum logistical lag ♣ [5.3-5.6] ♥</b> Days.

fundamental ritual of Christianity; indeed, as Arnold as argued, "...in whatever form, the mass can be seen as a key ritual in the production of medieval community...."<sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup> There were many varieties of masses, varying in frequency and nature depending on the community involved. Monasteries and convents held several masses a day, in particular masses for the dead.<sup id="cite_ref-168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> Parish priests were supposed to say one mass daily, but it is unclear whether this was common, especially during this period, which predates the general establishment of parish churches in localities. High mass was rare, most likely restricted to high holidays such as Christmas; the laity were only expected to attend mass on Sundays, and even this was not asserted as a fundamental part of orthodox Christianity until a  later period.<sup id="cite_ref-169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup> A rough description of a typical mass is as follows. The priest read out a psalm on the nature of original sin, followed by hymns on Sundays. Then the priest read from the Gospel, and prepared the bread and wine for the Eucharist (at this point, the laity would give any offerings they had for the collection box). This description is from (Arnold)<sup id="cite_ref-170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> The priest then passed the Pax, an object with the crucifix on it, around and the laity kissed it.<sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> This seems to have taken the place of Communion on days when the laity did not participate in it; mass then ended. Monastic masses and special liturgical masses would have been slightly different, but these were the main elements. NOTE: Most Christians-in fact, probably the vast majority, during this period-did not attend mass on anything approaching a regular basis, perhaps at all.<sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup> Urban people, in particular those in Rome, probably attended church more regularly than, say, those in the remote Appenines, but this is no more than a reasonable hypothesis for this period. I would also like to note the serious paucity of sources, and thus of secondary scholarship, on the early medieval mass in Italy: we simply do not know very much about lived religion in early medieval Europe, and especially in Italy.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> Parish priests were in theory required to say mass daily, but it is almost impossible to know how stringently this was obeyed.<sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> Swanson, writing of the period after 1215, has noted that "How it [the Mass] fits into a liturgical round is not easily considered, for masses were celebrated with almost mind-boggling regularity and in incaluclable quantities...."<sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> This was true also of the tenth through the twelfth centuries; while monasteries offered liturgical masses for the dead daily, and as the tenth century went on, this became one of their main functions, especially those reformed by the Cluniacs. For a description of liturgical masses for the dead. <sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup> "Participant" thus reflects, here, monks praying for the dead while not officiating the Mass itself.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ weekly ♥</b> Defining "audience" as the laity not taking communion (regulations on which only appeared after 1215), the laity were required to attend mass once a week on Sundays.<sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 2 ♥</b> hours.

Ravenna? Or a tiny parish such as, borrowing from Tuscany, the tiny parish of San Gavino degli Adimari, which contained even in 1347 maybe 100 people?). See (Klapisch-Zuber &amp; Herlihy) for a good discussion of the difficulties involved in determining the size of medieval settlements; their source is the Florentine Catasto of 1427, easily the most detailed demographic record that survives for medieval Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> The number of 100 is based on an average-sized medieval settlement with, perhaps, 20 or 30 households/hearths (<i>fuochi</i>).

The idea is already explicit in St. Paul: widowers are allowed to remarry but are not encouraged to do so (1 Cor. 7:39-40). Early Christian writers show a remarkable consensus in supporting that view: the consensus includes Ter- tullian, Athenagoras, the Shepherd of Hermas, Clement, and Origen. In the fourth century St. John Chrysostom composed a treatise addressed ‘’To a Young Widow’’, encouraging her to remain in her widowhood rather than succumb to human weakness and remarry. // Chrysostom's early contemporary, St. Basil of Caesarea, is the author of numerous letters, a number of which were accepted in the Byzantine Church as normative canonical texts and sanc- tioned as such by the Council in Trullo (692). He writes: "The rule establishes one year of excom- munication for those who marry a second time. Other authorities even require two years. Those who marry a third time are often excommunicated for three or four years. And such a union is not called marriage, but polygamy, or rather punishable fornication ... (noevd(av xExokaoptvriv)." This negative attitude toward second or third marriages is maintained in the ninth century by St. Theodore of Stoudios; recognizing that civil law authorized such unions, he forbids their blessing in church.'5 The canons attributed to Patriarch Nicephorus (806-815)16 also forbid the "crowning" of any marriage except the first.17 This principle, which forbade ecclesiastical sanction in cases of consecutive bigamy and trigamy, must have been challenged first in the case of emperors. In the ninth century Theodore of Stoudios deplores the evil example of Emperor Constantine V Copronymos, who was married three times.” <sup id="cite_ref-559" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-559">[559]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious thought reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The Byzantine Empire maintained a network of philanthropic institutions designed to shelter travellers and homeless migrants (‘’xenoi’’), provide free medical care for the ill, nurture orphans, and organize food allotments during famines (Constantelos 1991: 113).

These rationalizations were frequently cited together with Paul’s admonition to slaves to obey their masters (Colossians 3:22) and Augustine’s assertion that slavery is the natural consequence of sin (‘’City of God’’, 19), and they contributed to the fostering of institutions such as slavery and coercive authority of other types through the early 1200s.” <sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Human_Sacrifice">Normative Ideological Aspects of Human Sacrifice</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=ItRav**&amp;action=edit&amp;section=69" title="Edit section: Normative Ideological Aspects of Human Sacrifice">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 0 ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of an out-group member ♣ absent ♥</b>  “The [Old Testament] expressly abhors and forbids human sacrifice (Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5; Deut. 12:31-32; 18:10; 1 Kgs. 16:30-34).

Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ.

Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Serious offenders against religious law, if they desired forgiveness and reconciliation with the Christian community, submitted to liturgical penance, assigned by a bishop and concluded by his laying on of hands in a reconciliation ceremony. There was no absolute agreement as to precisely what sins were serious enough to require this recourse, but topping the list were homicide, idolatry, and adultery. Julian Pomerius, a Mauritanian who served as a priest in Arles and another of Ruricius’s correspondents, distinguished between slight sins [parva peccata] and more serious crimes [crimina].

"The disciplinary aspect of penance comes more to the fore in the period after the edict of Milan (312), by which Christianity was tolerated as a religion within the Roman empire. This made it possible for Christian bishops to convene in councils and to issue their decisions. Penance is often found as a prerequisite for returning to the Christian congregation after having committed a serious fault. The council of Ancyra for example, which convened in 314, ruled that men having had sexual relations with animals should live as supplicants for fifteen years, after which they were allowed to take part in prayer in church; after another five years they were allowed to take part in ‘simple communion’ and if they persevered they were finally allowed to participate again in communion with offerings. This canon illustrates a process by which sinners were only gradually readmitted as full members of the Christian community. During a period of fifteen years they were apparently not entitled to attend Mass, and only five years later were they readmitted to the Eucharist, but evidently still with reservations since their offerings were not accepted until after a certain lapse of time. These rules, as issued by bodies invested with ecclesiastical authority, implied a certain form of control and discipline to make certain that they were carried out in a proper way. Councils acted as legislative bodies to issue general rulings on disciplinary matters and to determine the period of penance for a specific offence. Somebody however had to oversee the process of assigning such disciplinary measures, to keep an eye on the proper behaviour of the excommunicated person and on the process by which he was to be readmitted into the community. The actual assignment of a period of exclusion, according to the rulings issued by councils from the fifth and sixth centuries, was in principle the task of the local bishop. [...] The church historian Sozomenos described the ritual of penance as he had seen it in Rome, and from his description it is clear that in Rome as in Hippo penitents were assigned a special place in the church. At the end of Mass the penitents threw themselves on the floor and the bishop joined them with tears in his eyes. He then stood up and the penitents followed suit. It seems that Sozomenos is describing the act of entrance into a penitential state here, for he goes on to explain that the penitents were obliged to fulfil penitential exercises such as fasting for as long as the bishop had decided, and then were acquitted of their sin and allowed to take part fully in the liturgical practices of the community again." <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Type of punishment this typically entailed (can be more than one):</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b> "Although late antique church council canons put great effort on writing up suggestions for bishops on the length of penance to be imposed for particular misdeeds, early Christian texts were remarkably unforthcoming on the details of activities a penitent was to undertake during this period.

A great number of citizens of Thessalonica had been killed by Gothic troops as a reprisal for the murder of their general Butherich. Although the penance assigned to the emperor has often been depicted as a show of force on the part of the Christian bishop, it is now conceived as a carefully balanced act between bishop and emperor to redeem Theodosius of the sin and of the political blame he had contracted. In Ambrose’s view Theodosius, as a baptized Christian, could not partake of the Eucharist with blood on his hands. Ambrose did his utmost to arrange for a public penance of the emperor, thereby strengthening the political position of his imperial friend. [...] As Ambrose had expressed it in a sermon delivered during another contest with an emperor, the emperor was a member of the Church and not someone who was above it (<i>intra ecclesiam, non supra ecclesiam</i>). As a member of the Church, a baptized emperor such as Theodosius - which at that time was still something of a novelty - should live according to the strict rules of the Christian faith. The guilt that he had incurred because of the massacre was well known to all Christians and put the bishop in a difficult position. Ambrose could not ignore the emperor’s sin, but could he deal with this sinner as he would have done with others? Probably not, although it has been observed that we lack specific knowledge about the ordinary ways of dealing with sinners in Milan in this period. Ambrose could point to biblical precedents of kings doing penance, most of all, of course, the case of David doing penance for his adultery with Bathsheba and his responsibility for the killing of her husband Uriah. Ambrose’s arguments might have helped to convince Theodosius that penance could also bring honour, but probably Ambrose also showed him the way out of a precarious political situation, as Neil McLynn has argued. In November the emperor declared that he was willing to undergo public penance. In the address delivered by Ambrose on the death of the penitent emperor five years later, the bishop reminded his audience how the emperor laid down all the imperial insignia, bewailed his sin in public in the basilica and implored absolution with tears and laments. He stressed that the emperor was not ashamed to do what the citizens were ashamed of: to do penance in public." <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ punishment of elites ♣ present ♥</b> "From Jerome’s letter to Oceanus we learn that the Roman matrona Fabiola entered the order of penitents (<i>ordo paenitentium</i>) to atone for her bigamous behaviour. Again we can observe that in Rome penitents were assigned a specific place in church. The entry of an honourable lady into the order of penitents seems to have aroused great public interest in the city of Rome. Interestingly, Jerome adds that this episode happened ‘ante diem paschae’, thereby probably stressing the import of Fabiola’s act, choosing to retire from the Christian fold as a penitent right before the most important Christian festival. Jerome presents Fabiola’s case as an example of how a Christian even of the highest social standing should not refrain from abasing themself in front of the community.
