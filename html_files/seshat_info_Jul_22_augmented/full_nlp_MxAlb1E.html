It was built on a hill 400 metres above the valley floor,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MxAlb1E] with limited access to farmland and water,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxAlb1E] which suggests other reasons for the founding of the settlement.

If I am correct in my interpretation of the Main Plaza, then rituals like human sacrifice and ancestor veneration, which invoked the cosmic creation, were performed amid a material symbol of the Zapotec cosmos. The scale, accessibility, openness, and symbolism of the Main Plaza indicate that it was constructed as an arena where thousands of people could have participated in public rituals. Until the Nisa phase, the Main Plaza was open on its eastern side, making activities on the plaza accessible to commoners living on the terraces below. Crowds could have entered the plaza from the east, moving from the everyday world of their homes below into a sacred space materializing symbolic references to the sacred past of ancestors, deities, and the cosmic creation. Ceremonies included a blending of traditional activities such as autosacrificial bloodletting, ancestor veneration, divination, and ritual feasting with new practices like human sacrifice (Blanton et al. 1999:105- 7; A. Joyce 2000, 2004; Orr 1997, 2001; Urcid 2008). The images on the Building L-sub and Building J programs could be viewed as processions moved past and would have continually communicated the significance of sacrifice and warfare. Sacrificial practices, especially human sacrifice, were particularly significant in contacting deities and ancestors, reenacting the cosmic creation and the sacred covenant, and renewing the world (A. Joyce 2000; Monaghan 1990). Human sacrifice now linked the activation of the sacred covenant to warfare.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_260_MxAlb1E] NOTE: Women's rituals are here considered "most widespread" because, unlike other rituals, which were confined to specialised buildings, these ones were performed in virtually every house. Moreover, figurines have been found in Monte Alban's hinterland, not just in Monte Alban itself [MAJIDBENAM_REF_261_MxAlb1E]. However, Marcus reconstructs two possible women's rituals, and only one can be coded. The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived. We suspect, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, that small solid figurines— of which we have found hundreds in household context—provided the medium to which the spirits of specific ancestors could return during this petitioning. Women preferred to petition their female ancestors, which may account for the fact that the majority of these figurines are women." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_262_MxAlb1E] "Women’s ritual seems to have been conducted in the house, the adjacent lean-to, and the surrounding dooryard. The recently deceased ancestors—both males and females, but especially females—appear to have been the focus of much of this ritual. Small solid figurines, sometimes arranged in ritual scenes, evidently provided a venue to which the spirits of the ancestors could return; in that venue they were probably consulted, petitioned, and involved in the ongoing affairs of their descendants. Women also made figurines of animals (principally dogs and birds), which may have served the ancestors as “animal agents” like those described for China." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_263_MxAlb1E] "In later periods in China, animals continued to be important as lineage emblems, playing roles in ritual and in communicating with the Sky, Earth, and the dead (Chang 1980: 209).The Shang-period Chinese (1200-1000 b.c.) depicted animals on bronze vessels, including dragons or snakes. Such depictions were called wu, a term that has been translated “animal offerings.”According to K. C. Chang (1983: 65): 'to make animal offerings was a concrete means of achieving communication between heaven and earth, the dead and the living. We thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the animal designs on Shang and Chou bronzes are iconographically meaningful: they are images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses in the task of communication between heaven and earth, the spirits and the living.'"

The scale, accessibility, openness, and symbolism of the Main Plaza indicate that it was constructed as an arena where thousands of people could have participated in public rituals. Until the Nisa phase, the Main Plaza was open on its eastern side, making activities on the plaza accessible to commoners living on the terraces below. Crowds could have entered the plaza from the east, moving from the everyday world of their homes below into a sacred space materializing symbolic references to the sacred past of ancestors, deities, and the cosmic creation. Ceremonies included a blending of traditional activities such as autosacrificial bloodletting, ancestor veneration, divination, and ritual feasting with new practices like human sacrifice (Blanton et al. 1999:105- 7; A. Joyce 2000, 2004; Orr 1997, 2001; Urcid 2008). The images on the Building L-sub and Building J programs could be viewed as processions moved past and would have continually communicated the significance of sacrifice and warfare. Sacrificial practices, especially human sacrifice, were particularly significant in contacting deities and ancestors, reenacting the cosmic creation and the sacred covenant, and renewing the world (A. Joyce 2000; Monaghan 1990). Human sacrifice now linked the activation of the sacred covenant to warfare.

They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour.

Effigy vessels and urns, sometimes depicting Cocijo, and a variety of zoomorphic vessels usually representing animals associated with water including ducks, conch shells, frogs, and toads are much more common in tombs and burials with elaborate offerings. These data suggest that associations with rain and the rain god were related to status, both achieved and ascribed by birth.

Instead of a redistributive economy, we postulate that much Period I exchange occurred in marketplaces frequented by household producers and consumers (Blanton 1983; Blanton, Kowalewski, Feinman, and Appel 1982:65-68; Feinman, Blanton, and Kowalewski 1984). If production was primarily in the hands of households, it is hard to see how distribution or exchange could have been controlled by a central political institution. Market exchange and marketplaces certainly were important when the Spanish first described sixteenth-century Oaxaca, and they continue to be important institutions to this day (Beals 1975; Cook and Diskin 1976). It seems reasonable to suggest that these thriving contact-period institutions had a long prior history, even though it is difficult to identify market exchange or even marketplaces archaeologically. We still lack indisputable evidence for this hypothesis. Our surveys did find at least one site that had features consistent with a marketplace - a low hill in the middle of the Valle Grande area, south of Monte Albán, not in one of the district capitals or other civic-ceremonial centers, but between them, at the intersection of three proposed district boundaries. The site dates to Early and Late I. It has no mounds; instead it has a large (55 by 38 meters), open, easily accessible platform bordered by large boulders. There is an unusual amount of artifactual evidence here for specialized production: misfired pottery, dense concentrations of chipped chert and quartzite, a tunnel into bedrock apparently to mine quartz, two circular bedrock features that may have served in a grinding or pounding operation, and a bark beater for making paper (Blanton, Kowalewski, Feinman, and Appel 1982:262). The location, open plaza, and artifactual evidence are what one might expect for a market."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_685_MxAlb1E]  There is no direct evidence for a market system during this period (and no evidence for a market at the capital Monte Alban)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_686_MxAlb1E], but other, indirect, evidence suggests a form of production and trade in the valley at this time. This evidence includes the specialisation of ceramic production by different communities (such as those seen in different assemblages at Monte Albán)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_687_MxAlb1E], and the absence of evidence for state storage facilities, “a prominent byproduct of the redistributive economies, suggests the presence of a different mode of exchange.”.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_688_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Contracts</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ State enforcement ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "no written records of economic transactions’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_689_MxAlb1E]  There is no surviving evidence of debt or credit structures (prehispanic writing refers mainly to place and people names, as well as calendric dates).

The functions of drainage, collection, filtration, transport, and impoundment of water for domestic use are performed by specialized water control features. Independent construction of these specialized features is not likely since they are of little use when not operating as part of the complete system. This indicates a certain amount of central planning on the part of the Monte Alban elite. The planning of this system may have taken place as early as Late Monte Alban I (400-150 B.C.) since the North Platform was well underway by this time and a test excavation made by Kuttruff and Autry (1978) into the base of the diversionarydefensive wall which forms the reservoir in the North Barranca indicates a Late Monte Alban I construction date. Beginning of the system may be traced to the Early Monte Alban I phase (500-400 B.C.) since Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: 96) report an Early Monte Alban I platform with a drain carved into bedrock in their North Platform excavations. While the degree of centralization needed to construct and maintain the system is unknown, the presence of a functionally complex water supply system, combined with the monumental architecture of the Main Plaza, indicate a centralized authority able to plan, mobilize, and coordinate labour on a large scale. Thus, the civic water supply system adds another dimension which must be considered in discussions about the classification of Monte Alban as urban or the centre of a military confederacy. Agricultural water control features are also present at Monte Alban. The most complex agricultural water control system is the dam and canal system which irrigated approximately 50 h. of the Xoxocotlan piedmont east of Monte Alban. This system was in use during Early and Late Monte Alban I (550-I50 B.C.) and was abandoned at the beginning of Monte Alban II. The agricultural system is smaller and less complex than the civic system and probably could have been managed and maintained by the population which lived along the canal. It has been estimated that the Xoxocotlan piedmont agricultural system could have fed, at most, 250 people (O'Brien, et al. i979; Mason, et al. I977). The civic water control system, however, probably supplied water to a substantial percentage of the population of Monte Alban, estimated by Blanton (1978: 30) to have been over 15,000 during the Classic period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_716_MxAlb1E] "As early as the San José phase, maize farmers in the Valley of Oaxaca supplemented water from rainfall with simple irrigation techniques (Flannery et al. 1967). Their repertoire included pot or well irrigation - a labor-intensive strategy that can be employed in many alluvial zones of the valley. One aspect of well irrigation is that it can be implemented by a single farmer or the members of one household. Early Oaxaca farmers also likely secured water by building modest check dams and small channels to divert water from seasonal runoffs and the temporary streams that run during the rainy season. These irrigation techniques also required no central management and little or no labor from outside the household. Neither large-scale irrigation systems nor massive networks of canals have been important during the long history of this region."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_717_MxAlb1E]  The use of small scale canal irrigation systems is inferred from the presence of settlements in the piedmont area (which would require some water control), but direct evidence for irrigation is found in the later periods. Any irrigation that was present would have been very small in extent and therefore not centrally controlled.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_718_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_REF_719_MxAlb1E][MAJIDBENAM_REF_720_MxAlb1E]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ provision of irrigation works ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Health infrastructure ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Control of infectious disease ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Care of war invalids/veterans ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Care of orphans ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Care of elderly ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ State pensions for non-elites ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Entertainment_and_Knowledge_Well-Being">Entertainment and Knowledge Well-Being</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MxAlb1E&amp;action=edit&amp;section=75" title="Edit section: Entertainment and Knowledge Well-Being">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Entertainment buildings ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> The buildings during this period were primarily residential, and the specific function of non-residential buildings cannot be reliably identified until the architectural styles of the Monte Alban II phase appear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_721_MxAlb1E]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Theatres ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> The buildings during this period were primarily residential, and the specific function of non-residential buildings cannot be reliably identified until the architectural styles of the Monte Alban II phase appear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_722_MxAlb1E]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Arenas ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> The buildings during this period were primarily residential, and the specific function of non-residential buildings cannot be reliably identified until the architectural styles of the Monte Alban II phase appear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_723_MxAlb1E]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ritual buildings/spaces ♣ present ♥</b>  Temples were present at this time but the standardised two-room temples was not yet present at Monte Alban, and so a permanent state religion of more than one organisational level cannot be inferred.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_724_MxAlb1E]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Other ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ accessibility of entertainment buildings ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time entertainment specialists ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ status of full-time entertainment specialists ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> insufficient evidence</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Access to education ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> education system is unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Publicly funded or subsidized education ♣ ♥</b> education system is unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Schools for children? ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> education system is unknown  The buildings during this period were primarily residential, and the specific function of non-residential buildings cannot be reliably identified until the architectural styles of the Monte Alban II phase appear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_725_MxAlb1E]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Universities, “proto-universities”, or other higher education ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> education system is unknown.
