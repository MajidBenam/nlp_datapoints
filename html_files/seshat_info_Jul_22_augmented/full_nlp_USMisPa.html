"Beginning A.D. 300-400, the bow replaced the atlatl in most regions" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] In the Mississippian region (Midwest and Upland South) the transition from atlatl to bow was "relatively rapid because dart points disappear from the archaeological record" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Introduction of the bow in the Mississippi region decreased social complexity because it caused the collapse of the Hopewell system, the abandonment of mound centers and alliance-exchange relationships [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Bow enabled a new bow and native crops subsistence strategy which lead to a movement to and the effective exploitation of previously marginal lands and "household autonomy" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] There followed an economic intensification and population growth which eventually "packed the landscape with settlements." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USMisPa]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 400 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 500 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 600 CE<div> Late arrowheads appear. "This transition to small, thin, triangular or triangular corner-notched points has long been accepted as evidence of the bow, but variation in the morphology of late arrow point types suggest that this transition was governed by social and historical factors that varied across these regions." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Late arrowheads may indicate the technological development of fletching as they are less heavy and thick than the early arrowheads. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] First evidence of intergroup violence appears in the archaeological record (arrowpoints embedded in skeletons in individual and group burials). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] No evidence for an increase in social complexity and hierarchy or deviation from the "trend toward household autonomy" at this time. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "For the first time, there is evidence, in the form of group and individual burials with embedded arrow points, of the bow as the primary weapon of intergroup violence." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "In Middle Woodland times there isn’t much evidence for warfare."  "Later, after about A.D. 600 there is more evidence (scalping, embedded arrow points)."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Population growth, reduced access to resources, sedentism, and the desire to avoid conflict made the high costs of intensified food production more attractive." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_USMisPa]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 700 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 800 CE<div> Intensification of Maize farming begins. Higher yields from maize cultivation enables more food to be extracted from a smaller territory. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Although there is scattered evidence for corn, or maize, during Middle Woodland times, it wasn't until Late Woodland times, after AD 700-800, that it became an important food crop." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Social complexity increases from this period. "Site plans gained greater internal complexity as houses clustered into court-yard groups and, toward [1000 CE], the southern pattern of civic-ceremonial centers with large earthen mounds was established in many places. Nucleated settlements may have been a defensive response to bow warfare. Burials with embedded arrow points and sites fortified with palisades and ditches are widespread, although no present everywhere... New social roles linked to community defense, organization of labor, and communal storage of maize in secure central places laid the foundation for the increased group differentiation, competition, and hierarchy of the Mississippian period beginning A.D. 1000." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Palisades and ditches appear in the archaeological record. The first evidence of substantial intergroup warfare. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_USMisPa]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"trail networks also are important, and some of the historic east-west ones cross near Cahokia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Cahokia "controlled a critical choke point in trade routes that spanned the midcontinent" an idea that goes back to Brackenridge (1813 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The greatest environmental hazard would have been a late summer Mississippi River flood similar to the one that took place in 1993. A rise in the river at that time of the year simultaneously drowned crops, prevented easy fishing in shallow ponds, and ruined food stored in underground pits. Floods attributable to severe storms, including excessive water funnelled into the floodplain by creeks that drain the uplands, certainly caused localized disasters much like they did a century ago before effective flood-control measures were put in place." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_USMisPa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"No other major site was as advantageously situated. Cahokia was located in what was by far the widest expanse of land suitable for settlement in the American Bottom. More people could live there than anywhere else ... The high ground where Cahokia was located was bordered on the north and south by large tracts of low-lying land that received the waters of different upland streams."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_USMisPa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner; Kalin Bullman ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Peter Peregrine ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=USMisPa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣  ♥</b> in squared kilometers.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> People.

through time, but the basic ritual structure may have remained essentially the same from late prehistory into the Colonial period. Based on the above description, warfare rituals would have included the creation of sacred space; elite involvement and sponsorship of rituals, especially feasting; use of sacred paraphernalia and props such as horns and feathers of supernaturals, plants, crystals, pipes, paints, and consecrated vessels; emphasis on symbolism in food, behavior, and color; consumption of medicines, including the black drink and the war medicine, for ritual cleansing and purification; acquisition, display, and ritual manipulation of war trophies; and ritual performance, including dancing with raptor tails or wings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_177_USMisPa] The following provides some information as to the effects of the "black drink": "In addition to being a stimulant, the beverage also acts as a diuretic, causing increased perspiration. And the Indians sometimes used it as an emetic. On these occasions they would drink it in large quantities, and in a quarter to half an hour they would vomit. Sometimes they would hold their arms across their chests and expell [sic] the contents of their stomachs six or eight feet. The Timucuans would drink repeatedly, vomiting it up each time (fig. 56). [...] Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, exciting it at all levels. [...] It enables a person to have a more rapid and clearer flow of thought, makes him capable of more sustained intellectual effort, and sharpens his reaction. It also increases his capacity for muscular work and lessens fatigue. Moreover, some evidence suggests that large doses of caffeine speed up blood clotting. These effects are pronounced with doses of 0.5 to 1.0 grams--the equivalent of three to six cups of strong coffee. When consumed in large quantities, black drink could have delivered at least this much caffeine, and perhaps as much as 3.0 to 4.0 grams. These effects from large quantities of black drink could have been important and even decisive factors in activities such as the ballgame or warfare."
