[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ItRomPr] "In Africa, Punic was widely spoken as well as Latin, and in a famous passage of The City of God Augustine reminds the reader that the imperious Roman capital had not only placed the yoke of dominion on defeated peoples; it had also imposed Latin as the official language (Augustine, The City of God, 19, 7)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItRomPr]<b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Roman State Religions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Imperial Cult ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Roman Principate (31 BCE-284 CE) refers to the first period of the Roman Empire, when the de facto ruler was termed the <i>princeps</i>, or 'leading citizen'. The period begins with the victory of the first emperor, Augustus (then Octavian) over his rival Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE and ends with the accession of Diocletian after the 'crisis' of the 3rd century CE (235-284 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Retaining and solidifying many of the institutions, cultural forms, and economic base that had led to Rome's hegemonic position during the Republican period, the Empire became one of the largest, most long-lived, and most prosperous imperial states the world has ever known. Augustus established a dynasty lasting until the death of the Emperor Nero in 68 CE, after which followed a brief civil war between different potential successors. Despite repeated bouts of similar warfare during succession crises following the various dynasties that ruled the Principate, the Empire remained remarkably stable throughout this period. Rome was able to unite - and keep together - a huge swathe of territory encompassing all of western Europe, North Africa, Egypt, the eastern Mediterranean, most of Anatolia, and parts of the Near East. Integrating diverse regions into this single empire facilitated the spread of Roman institutions - notably its legal system, urban infrastructure, cultural forms, and political structure. It also promoted economic development by enabling the safe transport of goods and people to every corner of the empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItRomPr] It was during this period that Rome built some of its greatest structures: the Pantheon, the Coliseum, the imperial <i>fora</i> (market squares) in the heart of Rome, and many others. The Principate overall produced so much wealth and so many cultural achievements that the great 18th-century English historian Edward Gibbon proclaimed the Empire at its peak in the 2nd century CE to be 'the period in the history of the world, during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the late 3rd century CE, beginning after the end of the Severan Dynasty, the Principate nearly collapsed in the face of internal warfare and pressure from external foes, including the Sassanid Persian Empire and nomadic tribes from Germany and eastern Europe. Rome briefly lost control over parts of France, Britain, and southern Spain and suffered several significant losses in battle to the Sassanids. Under first the Emperor Aurelian (r. 270-275 CE) then Diocletian (r. 284-305), however, all territory was recovered and a series of administrative and economic reforms inaugurated a second phase of the Roman Empire, which we refer to as the Dominate (denoting the increasing centralization of authority and the development of a large bureaucratic apparatus).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Nominally, there was no change in political organization between the Republican period and the Principate. The first princeps, Augustus, kept all Republican institutions and offices, including the Senate, intact. There was clear practical change in the power structure, however, as Augustus, and all emperors after him, asserted personal control over almost the entire Roman army and were granted unprecedented legislative, religious, and judicial powers to shape politics and Roman society at large. Whereas a defining principle of Republican governance was that no individual should be able to hold multiple offices simultaneously, amassing power in several domains (military, legislative, religious, and so on), emperors broke this tradition and drew their authority from numerous offices, titles, and the authority they carried.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Roman emperor was also generally one of the wealthiest people in the Principate, controlling huge agriculturally productive estates throughout the Empire, particularly in North Africa and Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItRomPr] In this period, state revenues were split between the 'public' treasury (<i>aerarium</i>) and an imperial treasury (<i>fiscus</i>) under the direct control of the emperor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItRomPr] The Principate had a fairly limited reach, particularly outside of Italy, but the state did have some significant expenses which it met by collecting tax from the Empire's vast territory and large population, taking in rents from the imperial estates. In addition to paying the salaries of imperial officials - a relatively small expense as only limited central authority was exerted in the provinces (mainly the provincial governors and their retinue) - the emperor was responsible for financing a professional citizen army, the major state expense along with public works projects such as roads, aqueducts, and temples. The costs of these public works, though, were split between the personal fortune of the emperors who acted as patrons, particularly in Italy, and that of wealthy patrons in the provinces, who financed much of the urban growth in these regions. Further, beginning in the later Republican period and continuing throughout the Empire, the imperial state provided grain at reduced prices to citizens living in Rome; another considerable expense.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Emperor was assisted by his directly appointed <i>consilium</i> (advisory council), which was often made up of freedmen (manumitted slaves) and personal slaves.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItRomPr] The Senate, not the emperor, formally retained ultimate executive power and could override or critique the emperor's actions, but in practice this was quite rare and could be dangerous to the critic.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItRomPr] This centralized exercise of power by the Emperor, though, did not extend to the provinces, where the focus of imperial administration was squarely on securing revenue (cash and in-kind tax and rents on imperial properties) and maintaining peace, both internally and against potential external enemies, notably the powerful Persian Empires to the East. Roman provinces were governed by fairly autonomous officials (<i>procurator</i>, <i>curator</i>, <i>praefectus</i>, <i>proconsul</i>, etc.) and priests (<i>flamen</i>, etc.).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItRomPr] Urbanization was also encouraged throughout the Empire; provincial cities were administered as 'mini-Rome's, with local urban equivalents of the Senate and most administrative, judicial, and religious magistracies. Roman cultural and infrastructural achievements were widely mimicked, with aqueducts, temples, theatres, bathhouses, and material culture (for example, particular ceramic forms, a culture of communal feasting, and the habit of publicizing achievements with inscribed stone tablets) adapted by numerous provincial towns and cities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItRomPr] This was true across the Empire, though particularly salient in the west, whereas Roman settlements in the East tended to retain many of their pre-Roman urban forms and cultural traditions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]By the mid-2nd century CE, the city of Rome had reached over one million inhabitants, a significant feat for an ancient urban settlement. The population of the entire Empire is estimated at between 50 to over 60 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItRomPr] Estimating the number of state employees is an extremely difficult task, but one scholar has supposed that if the imperial government at its largest extent in the 4th century CE 'had somewhat over thirty thousand functionaries', then before this time a figure of 10,000-12,000 might be reasonable.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItRomPr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Roman Principate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Roman_Empire_0CE: 31BCE-99CE; Roman_Empire_100CE: 100CE-199CE; Roman_Empire_200CE: 200CE-284CE ♥</b>  Roman_Empire_0CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItRomPr] Roman_Empire_100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItRomPr] Roman_Empire_200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItRomPr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  4703030: 31BCE-99CE;  5108427: 100CE-199CE;  5390141: 200CE-284CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Italic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Latin ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Ancient Roman Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Catholicism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Judaism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Garrett Fagan ♥</b>This polity was coded early, was the target of dedicated workshops, and had many experts look over it.

"Contrary to other religions of the same type, such as the cults of Isis and Osiris, Serapis, Dionysus (all well-known examples), Mithraicism eschewed any external manifestations and depended only on its initiatory nature to recruit its followers. ... it gradually became a common faith for soldiers, civil servants, merchants ... The members joined a spirituality of an initiatory type ... shared with a large group of solar faiths ... that promised both a life near to the deity and a personal redemption."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"From the end of the first century B.C.E. we have evidence of a cult coming from the East and gradually and discretely conquering the Roman army and administration (Daniels). This god, previously unknown to the Romans, was called Mithra. Some historians believe (see Plutarch, Pomp. 24.7) that the notorius Cilician pirates defeated by Pompeius propagated this cult when deported in Calabria. We now believe that it was a late transformation of the god Mithra, the friendly protector of contracts .... and defender of true and just causes."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"We must also stress that this god retained, in his manifestation in the Roman Empire, his essential characteristics of friend and guardian of contracts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Mithra probably won over even the imperial house. We are wary about the well-known initiation of the emperor Nero to the mysteries of the Magi through Tiridates (see Turcan 1989:237). However, it seems that the emperor Commodus (192) was an unworthy adept of the mysteries, because he was suspected of having killed a fellow-adept during a ceremony simulating a ritual sacrifice. The imperial house had a much worthier adept in Diocletian and his colleagues of the Tetrarchy: Galerius and Licinius. The god is then called the fautor imperii sui, the "protector of the imperial power" (Inscription of Carnuntum in 307)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Mithraism: "on the social level people learned, in the 'Persic Cavern', to respect the contract linking the human being to the cosmos and to the gods, and then, at least in an implicit way, to respect the emperors, who were divine beings, as intermediaries between the sky and the earth. The faithfulness to a vivifying cosmic order was thus accompanied by faithfulness to the one representing this order on earth. It is not surprising, then, that Mithra was invoked as Jupiter Dolichenus for the salvation of the emperor.

The Emperor was assisted by his directly appointed consilium (advisory councils) that were often made up of freedmen and personal slaves.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_110_ItRomPr] There were salaried officials who worked in the Imperial Bureaux (scrinia)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_111_ItRomPr] Salaries of officials were part of government expenditure: "The main items of expenditure were the maintenance of the army, the expenses of provincial government, the salaries of officials, the corn-supply and police of Rome, the maintenance of religion, the building of temples and other public works, and the public roads and aqueducts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_112_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Estimating the number of state employees is an extremely difficult task but one scholar has supposed that if the imperial government at its largest in the 4th CE 'had somewhat over thirty thousand functionaries' before this time a figure of 10,000-12,000 (as R. F. Tannenbaum suggests for Rome and Italy) might be reasonable.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_113_ItRomPr] <i>"At its largest extent, in the fourth century, the imperial government had somewhat over thirty thousand functionaries ... in the earlier centuries, when the empire was at the height of its power and glory, it employed only a fraction of that number." ... "Fourth cent., A. H. M. Jones (1964), 1057 n.44. The size of the administration in earlier centuries is harder to estimate: Eck (1980: 16) counts some 10,000 in the provinces under Trajan, mostly seconded soldiers ...; independently R. F. Tannenbaum (private communication) estimates a total of some 10,000-12,000 including Rome and Italy, but excluding the central and local adinistration of Egypt."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_114_ItRomPr]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Source of support ♣ state salary ♥</b> There were salaried officials who worked in the Imperial Bureaux (scrinia).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_115_ItRomPr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no examination system for the Roman bureaucracy.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Roman administration was typically formed out of a class of hereditary aristocrats.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_117_ItRomPr] The first paving of the Roman Forum occurred around 575-625 BCE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_118_ItRomPr] The first coin minted in Rome occurred about 269 BCE (one in Neapolis produced coins slightly earlier, around 281 BCE) and the first state archives was created in 78 BCE. Other buildings include: granaries and storehouses.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Buildings of the imperial bureaucracy, such as the Curia Julia. The Curia Julia was one of the main meeting places of the Roman Senate (later rebuilt under Diocletian after a fire in 283 CE). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_119_ItRomPr] The Senate also often met in appropriate temples.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_120_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The old Roman treasury - the aerarium Saturni - was for a time housed in the basement of the Temple of Saturn. There were lots of multi-purpose government buildings: basilicas, imperial fora, and porticos, which were utilized for government functions, such as official meetings or court hearings.Offices of local magistrates and town council buildings were housed in separate buildings. There were market buildings (the Markets of Trajan in Rome). Bathhouses proliferated.

Law thereafter was based on precedent. Our sources of knowledge of Roman law include the forensic speeches of Cicero; the Institutes of Gaius textbook (from 160 CE); and, much later, the sixth century CE Corpus Ius Civilis of Justinian. Wax tablets and papyri (contracts and wills etc.) also provide information on Roman law. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_121_ItRomPr] However, before this time restrictions on funerary extravagance, from the start of the 6th century, may suggest the Twelve Tables laws (of the Early Republic) codified an existing body of law and legal practices. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_122_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The constitutio Antoniniana of 212 CE brought an end to the distinction between civis and peregrius.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_ItRomPr] Social and legal distinctions were redrawn between honestiores (those with dignitas, public standing) and humiliores (those without). "Mandata" were directions from Emperor to provincial governors and state official.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_ItRomPr] The range of legal sanctions consisted was determined by social standing: aggravated execution, forced labour, beatings, and torture were reserved for slaves and humiliore), whereas fines and exile were more common for honestiores. The exception were for conspirators against an emperor who, despite their high standing, were often brutally tortured and executed. Long-term custodial imprisonment was unknown as a punishment.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Writing c200 CE "Papinian, perhaps the authority on law most respected in late antiquity, listed the sources of the ius civile as statutes (leges), popular resolutions (plebiscita), senatorial enactments (senatusconsulta), decrees of emperors (decreta principum) and the authoritative pronouncements of men learned in law, the jurists (auctoritas prudentium). To these was added the ius honorarium, the law contained in the Edict of the praetor, who, under the Republic and Early Empire administered law in Rome; this form of law derived its name from the praetor's magistracy (honos) and was held to 'assist, supplement or amend' the ius civile.".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_ItRomPr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Professional judges did not exist until the Roman Dominate although at that time their precise role vis-a-vis that of Imperial officials is a matter of debate. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_126_ItRomPr] Before this time there were no judges as a distinct profession in the Roman system of law. Local magistrates dealt with local matters, provincial governors dealt with provincial matters, and the praetors often dealt with cases in Rome. The Roman people could be duly convened as a final court of appeal in cases involving citizens.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b>"The criminal law owed much to the reforms of two past lawgivers, the proto-emperor, L. Cornelius Sulla (dictator and consul, 81-80 BC), and the emperor Augustus. Sulla established a number of courts (quaestiones) to try various criminal offences, such as murder and poisoning (or use of charms), or forgery; in the statutes he would have defined the crime and the penalty. In other areas of criminal law, the framework supplied for later developments by the Leges Iuliae, the legislation of Augustus, predominates, with whole sections of the imperial law-codes devoted to imperial enactments relevant to the Julian laws on adulteries, corrupt solicitation (ambitus), extortion (repetundae), treason (maiestas) and on violence)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"As jury-courts fell out of use under the Early Empire, to be replaced by hearings before a single magistrate or judge, the courts established by the criminal statutes ceased to operate, but the statues themselves remained, as they specified offence and punishment. People prosecuted for murder, poisoning, or other relevant offences were still prosecuted under Sulla's law and liable to its penalties."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_ItRomPr] <i>Note (DH): the quaestiones were a sort of ad-hoc special tribunal - it refers to the section of law that the case was under, not an actual building, so 'court' is a bit of a stretch on the translation in the quote. Trials were still held basically wherever there was space -- bassilicae, fora, etc.</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Roman Dominate administration of justice was "thoroughly bureaucratized" and "regular courts, special courts were established to deal with particular matters and categories of persons." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_129_ItRomPr] Before this time there was no specialised court building. Courts could be held in the basilicas[MAJIDBENAM_REF_130_ItRomPr] (introduced by the 3rd Century BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_131_ItRomPr]) where a provincial governor could an hold audience or in the Roman forum. Basilicas were multi-purpose buildings a place for banking and money-changing and town hall activities. The forum was a multi-purpose building which had existed since the Roman Kingdom.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b> Law specialists first existed during the Principate when they commanded fees for their expertise. We know this because Emperor Claudius attempted to "limit the fees of advocates, which had become intolerably heavy" to protect "women and other helpless litigants from the rapacity of their lawyers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_132_ItRomPr] The first law school in Rome, for persons who wished to pursue career in the Imperial civil service, was established late second century CE.

Waters, such as from the (previously built) Aqua Marcia, would take 15-20 hours to reach the city. At the city the water would enter a distribution tank, before travelling through the terracota or lead-pipe network. The best evidence for piped urban water networking has been found at Pompeii. The water had three main destinations: street fountains, baths and domestic. Most Romans gained their fresh water from street fountains. For domestic use, water supply was controlled by size of bronze nozzle (adjutage) that connected the masonry channel to the lead pipe that entered the house. Domestic water was probably paid for with a "water tax". [MAJIDBENAM_REF_137_ItRomPr] Arsinoe, metropolis in Egypt (capital town of a nome) "had running water supplied by two reservoirs into which water was pumped from an arm of the Nile." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_138_ItRomPr]  By the 3rd century CE, there were 11 aqueduct lines into Rome [MAJIDBENAM_REF_139_ItRomPr] which we can infer required maintenance. Under Claudius (41-54 CE) Aqua Claudius and Anio Novis were built with a gradient which fell several inches every 100 feet. Tunnels were precisely angled and key stone arch used for 6 mile column of arches that carried water into Rome. Waters were distributed to public drinking fountains, public baths and other buildings, and to wealthy Romans who paid for running water [MAJIDBENAM_REF_140_ItRomPr].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ markets ♣ present ♥</b> Trajan's market [MAJIDBENAM_REF_141_ItRomPr].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ present ♥</b> A procurator for grain supply.

The first Emperor Augustus's rebuilding of Rome set the standard for a succession of builder Emperors who sought to 'leave their mark'. In the 60s, Nero built a ludicrously sumptuous palace, which was shortly followed by a massive amphitheater built by Vespasian between 69-79 CE. Emperor Trajan topped them both when he commissioned Appolodorus of Damascus to design a new Roman forum that required sheering 125 feet from the Capitoline hill. Among the buildings he ordered for this new plateau were Greek and Latin libraries, a Basilica where law cases were tried, and a famous shopping center, a six story concave complex carved into the hillside, that had 150 stores. The setting was completed by the reliefs on a monumental 125 foot column that chronicled his recent conquest of Dacia.

Similar scatters at Kalkriese near Osnabrück, Germany, led to the discovery of some pits of collected human remains, deriving from the historically-attested massacre of Varus’s three legions by Arminius in AD 9; but only a handful of more than 10,000 dead are known archaeologically (Schlüter and Wiegels 1999; Derks and Burmeister2009)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_266_ItRomPr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mass burials ♣ present ♥</b> "Mass graves exist from Early Imperial times onward. The site of Varus’ defeat near Osnabrück in A.D. 9 has so far turned up at least 7 bone pits, in which remains of men killed in combat and equids were buried together. Traces of massacres presumably connected with barbarian incursions or civil strife signal the destructiveness of the troubles that affected the western provinces — for instance, the bodies of 14 3rd-c. individuals executed and pitched into a well at a villa rustica in Regensburg-Harting, not to mention burials possibly linked with the Batavian revolt of A.D. 69 and the widely-cited if somewhat unclear circumstances of people thought to have been killed in a Frankish attack onthe Roman settlement of Krefeld-Gellep around 259."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_267_ItRomPr] The following text is not relevant to this specific variable because it relates to mass burials following epidemics, not violent conflicts: "It is striking, but I suppose not surprising, that tens of thousands of Roman citizens, living packed together in a culture which set a high value on a proper burial, tolerated the dehumanisation of mass graves. During epidemics, mortality soared. Several ancient writers have left us vivid descriptions of the spread of infection, the unpredictable incidence of death, the difficulty of burying all the dead quickly, the increasing neglect of traditional burial rites, the stench of dead bodies, their contamination of the water supply and then further infection. In such circumstances, cremation was too costly, because it consumed expensive fuel. Mass death involved mass burial; and in a serious epidemic there was no practical alternative to mass graves, into which the human dead were thrown pell-mell."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_268_ItRomPr]</div><div

non-violent form of public entertainment occurring on the occasion of a religious festival [MAJIDBENAM_REF_269_ItRomPr]. Regarding chariot races [MAJIDBENAM_REF_270_ItRomPr]: "The Circus Maximus was by far the largest stadium in Rome. It was a third of a mile long and could seat potentially up to 350,000 spectators. Unlike the Flavian Amphitheater, whose 55,000 seats would have been largely occupied by the upper classes, the size of the Circus Maximus meant that all segments of Roman society could attend races. Admission was free or for a nominal fee. In addition, chariot races were held frequently. Whereas there might have been only two or three gladiator contests per year, each of the over 100 holidays per year would have included chariot racing. All these factors ensured that chariot racing was the most popular form of entertainment for the average inhabitant of the city as well as the most accessible. "[A] race could have a maximum of 12 chariots. [...] The total length of a standard race was about eight kilometers and probably took less than 15 minutes to complete. [...] There were 24 races per day; thus, one could spend an entire day at the Circus Maximus. The winning charioteer received a crown of palm leaves and the winner's prize money. These prizes seem to have ranged between 5,000 and 60,000 sesterces for first place, and there were also lesser prizes for second, third, and fourth place. [...] They developed elaborate cheers and songs that tens of thousands of fans would chant and sing in unison. Often these chants deteriorated into abuse directed at the fans of other factions, and riots were not infrequent. [...] Many charioteers died not directly as the result of a crash but from being dragged around the track after one. This happened because charioteers habitually tied the reins to their arms." As for theatrical performances, which typically combined music, dance, and acting, they were divided in two kinds: "[m]imes sang, danced, and acted without masks, while pantomimes wore masks, acted, and danced but didn't sing; instead, musicians or a chorus offered musical accompaniment" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_271_ItRomPr]. It is also worth noting the following: "Of course, many of those who went to enjoy the races or the plays may not have had 'religion' (in our sense of the word) uppermost in their minds; but there remained strong associations between the games and the gods throughout the principate. Images and symbols of the appropriate deities, for example, were paraded through the streets of Rome to the Circus or theatre, where sacrifices were performed" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_272_ItRomPr].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not specified by source--expert input needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ weekly ♥</b> <i>Between daily and weekly.

However, starting from the rule of Augustus onwards, they became dynastic events, "used either to showcase [the Emperor's] chosen heirs [...] or to celebrate the beginning of reigns, almost as a coronation ritual" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_392_ItRomPr]. During the Principate and the Dominate eras, moreover, triumphs were much rarer, sometimes with decades passing between successive ones. But, besides this, the way they were celebrated during the Empire seems to have been broadly similar to how they were celebrated during the Republic. The procession started from outside the city, then proceeded through Rome's streets, passed through the triumphal gate, and ended at the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, where the Emperor, or a relative of his, dedicated a sacrifice to the god. Triumphs were grand affairs, involving feasts, and, in case of triumphs that were more military than dynastic, the display of prisoners of war, as well as precious items and natural wonders looted from the conquered territories. Usually they lasted one day, but there were exceptions.

"Of greater interest in the present context are the functionaries at a lower and intermediate level, in so far as slaves were there deployed. Rather complex and disparate findings emerge here. Still, it looks as if governmental service led, by middle age, to a sort of automatic manumission. With the exception of the treasurers (dispensatores), slaves aged between thirty and forty could mainly reckon with obtaining their freedom, although exceptions (CIL VI 8449; CIL VIII 12607) confirm the rule (Schumacher 2010). In most cases, the manumissio took place when the slaves, after subaltern positions as vicarii (managers: CIL VI 64), arcarii (treasurers: CIL VI 8719), and tabellarii (record-keepers: CIL VI 9052) were designated for higher duties, in other words, on the level of the adiutores (assistants), optiones (assistants), tabularii (account-keepers), praepositi (overseers), or proximi (personal assistants; Weaver 1972: 200–258). Their further careers continued in accordance with their aptitude, or by virtue of special promotion, to the post of procurator (high-level manager). These conditions explain why the auxiliary functions are not included in the inscriptions of successful freedmen; for the need to mention such low-level positions had now, with their social and professional rise, become inconsequential. Thus, as a rule, the careers of these men, as those careers are depicted in inscriptions of various sorts, begin with the position that they held at the time of their manumission (see, e.g., CIL VI 8428, 8608, 10233; ILS 1518)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_625_ItRomPr] </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Education is available to people from all social classes ♣ yes ♥</b> "In spite of the facilitation of access to primary education by the spread of schools and teachers, at no time and in no place was there established a public educational system with free access to all children. Children of the senatorial class, as well as of wealthy and ambitious other families, did not attend primary schools, but continued to study with private teachers (i.e., their families' own slaves or paid instructors) (Booth 1979b). Thus, Pliny the Elder designates a boy attending a (public) school as poor (Plin. Nat. 9. 8. 25). The style of one's education, then, was socially determined. A thorough (private) education on the primary level continued to be connected to wealth and social status. The consequences of such practices, that is to say, the quality (literacy, semi‐literacy) and quantification of literacy in the late republic and the principate are still matters of debate. Apart from the social strata concerned, modern estimates of the overall population's literacy quota vary between 5% and 20%, with great differences regarding periods, cities, regions, and individual provinces. [...] But what of the children who were not even free‐born? The rearing of slaves was likewise based on the concept of forming a particular kind of individual, but had significantly other aims in this, and thus a significantly different educational concept: not to bring out the best, to anchor virtues and values in the mind by education and the teaching of letters, literature, and the cultural memory of the Romans, but rather, ‘training.’ Young slaves were manipulated, trained, and taught like whelps or colts (Plut.

The assertions of leaders and the writings of intellectuals regularly affirmed their distinctiveness. A contrast with other peoples loomed large in the development of a self-perception. The history of Rome had, after all, taken shape in a setting that involved confrontations with other cultures right from the start. [...] Stereotypes abound. Harsh judgments by Roman writers on alien peoples seem common and characteristic." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_661_ItRomPr] At the same time, anyone could be made into a Roman citizen, regardless of ethnicity: "A Roman institution, unique in antiquity, affirms this attitude quite decisively: the admission of freed slaves to the citizenship. The Greeks observed the practice with some astonishment. [...] Extension of citizen privileges to communities and peoples within Italy was generous but not startling. A similar generosity toward slaves stood in a different category. The large majority of slaves acquired in this period came from abroad, prisoners of war reduced to servitude or captives purchased on the slave mart. [...] Whatever the motives, [...] the fact of frequent manumission is notable and meaningful. The ready entrance of freedmen into the citizen body signified a level of comfort with foreigners that was unmatched elsewhere in the classical world. What counts here is not liberality or generosity, but the presumption that citizenship could be shared by those of alien birth. Assimilation to Roman ways sufficed to authorize the award of full civic privileges. Romans evidently did not worry about diluting the purity of the stock. Nor did they balk at the exercise of political rights by those whose roots lay in Spain, Cilicia, or Syria. Numbers cannot be ascertained. But the citizenry plainly swelled substantially through the absorption of former slaves. Augustus eventually put on the brake - but not on racial grounds. The attitude of the Roman Republic is clear enough: its populace could only benefit from the admixture of people from everywhere in the Mediterranean." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_662_ItRomPr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> "To begin with, until fairly late in Roman history, women lacked individual names in the proper sense. Claudia, Julia, Cornelia, Lucretia, are merely family names with a feminine ending. Sisters had the same name and could be distinguished only by the addition of `the elder' or `the younger', `the first' or `the second', and so on. In the not uncommon case of marriage between paternal cousins, mother and daughter would have the same name, too. No doubt this was very confusing: a welcome confusion, one is tempted to suggest, since nothing could have been easier to eliminate. No great genius was needed to think up the idea of giving every girl a personal name, as was done with boys. It is as if the Romans wished to suggest very pointedly that women were not, or ought not to be, genuine individuals but only fractions of a family. Anonymous and passive fractions at that, for the virtues which were stressed were decorum, chastity, gracefulness, even temper and childbearing. They loved their husbands, to be sure--though we need not believe everything that husbands said when their wives were dead--but as one loves an overlord who is free to seek his pleasures elsewhere and to put an end to the relationship altogether when and if he so chooses. [...] Save for relatively minor exceptions, a woman was always in the power of some man--of her paterfamilias or of her husband or of a guardian. In early times every marriage involved a formal ceremony in which the bride was surrendered to her husband by the paterfamilias: he `gave her away' in the literal sense. Then, when so-called `free' marriages became increasingly common--free from the ancient formalities, that is, not free in the sense that the wife or her husband had made a free choice of partner ± she remained legally in the power of her paterfamilias. [...] It would probably be a safe guess that women of the lower classes were therefore more `emancipated', more equal de facto if not in strict law, more widely accepted as persons in their own right than their richer, more bourgeois, or more aristocratic sisters. This is a common enough phe- nomenon everywhere. No doubt they were freer in all senses ± far less inhibited by legal definitions of marriage or legitimacy, less bound by the double standard of sexual morality."

Those whose accomplishments on the battlefield won them renown were recognized as the Republic’s natural leaders, a connection made explicit in the aftermath of Cannae. Losses in that disaster and prior reverses had so depleted the ranks of the Senate that a special effort had to be undertaken to replenish its membership. The men selected were, first, those who had held various minor public offices, then ‘‘those who had spoils taken from the enemy on display in their homes or who had been decorated for saving the life of a citizen in combat’’ (Livy 23.23.5-6; see also Chapters 16 and 24). The civic crown, a wreath of oak leaves awarded for saving a citizen’s life, was bestowed for an act of exceptional gallantry: one had not only to save another’s life but slay the enemy threatening him without giving ground in the fight (Gell. NA 6.5.13). Likewise a young aristocrat won spoils by stripping the enemy he killed in individual combat in a duel or in the general meˆle ́e of battle (Gell. NA 2.11.3). This principle extended to all the decorations for valor awarded to soldiers; they bespoke courage in circumstances when there was no need to endanger one’s life, bravery ‘‘above and beyond the call of duty,’’ in other words. Worn in religious processions, they formed an important element in one’s public image (Polyb. 6.39.1-10; see also Chapter 13). Renown (gloria) seen in the visible tokens of one’s courage and heard in others’ praise of one’s exploits (laus) paved the way to public office, at least initially. [...] Superior courage in combat thus set some men apart from others and fit them to lead. As such, it served as a central element within the system of values that justified the dominance of the Republic’s upper class. Outstanding valor was thought to have accumulated in certain families, so that over time their descendants came to be viewed as having a greater store of it than others and hence a greater claim on public offices and positions of leadership."

The predominant function of banks undoubtedly remained the important role of money-changing for small-scale local transactions such as market purchases or the paying of taxes. ... It is clear that in the Roman empire it was possible to deposit and lend money at profitable levels of interest, that bills of exchange could be used, and that large sums could be transferred between individuals or between places in different provinces by means other than transporting actual coins. Bankers also placed deposits out on short-term interest-bearing loan on behalf of their clients, but most loans seem to have been made for the consumption or the puchase of land, rather than any kind of productive investment."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_730_ItRomPr] "Towards the end of the Republic, however, the so-called centesimae usurae came into use (1/100 per month, i.e. 12% per year).

Justinian, under the influence of Christianity, was not favourably disposed towards the charging of interest.

"Richard Duncan-Jones was able to calculate Gini coefficients for a variety of samples, ranging from 0.394 at Volcei in Italy to 0.679 at Magnesia in Asia Minor, most of the datasets are vitiated by serious inadequacies. The most complete list, the alimentary register of Ligures Baebiani, gives a low Gini of 0.435"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_822_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>general notes:</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Scheidel 2006: "The total number of honestiores was relatively small: the three ordines consisted of at least 350,000 but probably not more than 500,000 individuals (including family members), and there cannot have been many more than 100,000 veterans. Together, these groups accounted for approximately 1 per cent of the population of the empire.6 In the eyes of the government, the other 99 per cent of the population may have been ‘humble’, but they can hardly all have been of modest means. More than anything else, the inclusion of veterans among the honestiores leaves no doubt that this group cannot have constituted a homogeneous economic class. Needless to say, the late Roman separation of potentiores from tenuiores that banished lesser decurions and veterans from the ranks of the formal elite was even less suitable as a meaningful marker of economic graduations… if we stick, again very conservatively, to 40,000 first-class citizens and assume schematically that each of the remaining classes was one and a half times as large as the next-higher one, we get 60,000 members of the second class, 90,000 of the third, 135,000 of the fourth, 200,000 of the fifth, and 615,000 almost or completely propertyless citizens. This model produces 225,000 third- and fourth-class households, out of a total of about 1.15 million households with 4 million citizens…. I conclude that there is sufficient evidence in support of the notion of an economic continuum from a narrow elite to a steadily broadening middling group as we move down the resource ladder. Sources ranging from Republican Italy to imperial Egypt and Syria all point in the same direction. It is perfectly possible to reconcile the dominance of a disproportionately affluent elite with the presence of a substantial ‘middle’."[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Scheidel 2007: " Taken together, all these features clearly demonstrate considerable extensive economic growth in this period and, in view of Italy's dominant position in this process and its demographic development, are strongly indicative of significant mean per capita growth in this region. At the same time, the distribution of benefits remains obscure. On the one hand, numerous records of palatial mansions and lavishly endowed country estates, the accumulation and conspicuous consumption of luxury items, soaring property prices at the high end of the housing market, and the growth of slave retinues leave no doubt that the top tier of Roman society became vastly richer than it had been before, and make it at the very least highly likely that its members derived disproportionately large profits from empire. On the other hand, the character, scale and distribution of corresponding benefits for sub-elite groups remain largely impervious to investigation. Most importantly, our evidence does not permit an empirical assessment of real incomes."[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Lo Cascio 2008: "It is a widely held view that the majority of the population went on living at subsistence level. Nobody will dispute that distribution of income was disproportionately unequal, even if not all will agree that 'elites successfully manipulated their various situations to the detriment of others (especially non elites) in order to monopolize an inordinate share of existing benefits.'"[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Roman Egypt</i> - A fiscal register of private landholdings at the Arsinoite village of Philadelphia in ad 216/7, in which 15 out of 197 landowners are categorized as elite outsiders, appears to show a relatively equal distribution of arable land with a Gini index of 0.532. Tax reports of ad 308/9 from nearby Karanis, after some padding out of gaps, produce a Gini index for private landholding of 0.478.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_823_ItRomPr][MAJIDBENAM_BR] </div><h1><span class="mw-headline" id="References">References</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=ItRomPr&amp;action=edit&amp;section=83" title="Edit section: References">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h1><ol class="references"><li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1"><span class="cite-accessibility-label">Jump up </span>↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">(Davidson 2011, 47)</span></li><li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2"><span class="cite-accessibility-label">Jump up </span>↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">(Boatwright et al. 2012) Mary T.
