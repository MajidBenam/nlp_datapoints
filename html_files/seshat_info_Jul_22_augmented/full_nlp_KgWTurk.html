According to the Chou shu, the kaghan of the Turks "every year leads the nobles to the ancestral cavern to offer a sacrifice." The statement is repeated in several texts derived from the Chou shu and refers to the ruler of the Eastern Turks on whose territory the cavern - clearly a national shrine - was located. This, and also the practice of the annual ceremony, is confirmed by the Sui shu, which reports that every year the Western Turks send a high dignitary (or several dignitaries) to offer a sacrifice in the ancestral cavern. In the light of other evidence pointing to the mining or metallurgical activities of the Turks, there is reason to believe that these caverns were in fact mines. Semi-historical accounts of later date - which cannot here be examined in detail - firmly link "ancestral caverns" with metallurgy." <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Valentine was received by Turxath, son of the recently deceased Silziboulos, at whose funeral he was called upon to assist. The ceremony involved human sacrifice and, for the Romans, the painful obligation to lacerate their faces." <sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"As described in the sources, the process of electing the ruler reflects an archaic ceremonial probably ignored in real life. Accordingto the Chou shu, when the Turks elect a ruler, the high dignitaries of the realm bundle him in a felt rug and spin him nine times from east to west. After each turn, they bow to him. Then the ruler-elect is put on horseback and has to ride - probably to ascertain whether he can still mount a steed in a dizzy state. After the ride he is strangled with a silken shawl until he almost chokes. When the shawl is loosened, those standing around fire at him the question " H o w long will you be our kaghan?" The kaghan, dazed, is unable to give a clear answer, but from his mutterings those assisting at the ritual take a clue as to the length of hisreign. The Arab geographer Al-Istakhri ascribes almost the same ritual to the Khazars: "When they wish to appoint a kaghan, they bring him and throttle him with a piece of silk till he is nearly strangled, Then they say to him, 'How long do you wish to reign?' He says 'So and so many years.' If he dies before then, well and good. If not, he is killed when he reaches the year in question."1 3 Turks and Khazars were closely linked politically and linguistically, and the parallels between their rituals are not surprising. However, one wonders whether in the often bloody struggles for the throne such procedures were indeed followed." <sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Possible dysphoric ritual (for the participant):"At his investiture ceremony, the kaghan was first wrapped in a felt rug and spun nine times, then mounted on a horse and made to ride, and then nearly strangled with a silk shawl. When he had almost lost consciousness, he would be asked to state how many years he would rule." <sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Most frequent ritual: ancestor cult[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"That centered instead on the maintenance of life and health within the community and in relation to the ancestors and the cosmic forces. The most fundamental rites were offerings to the ancestors of the family and commu- nity.85 The ancestral rites focused on the hearth (ocak), one of the most per- sistent and widely evoked symbols in Turkic cultures. At the hearth, offerings of food and drink were either cast into the fire or smeared on the mouth of wood or felt “idols” that represented the ancestors and were kept near the hearth. Ancestor figures, carved in stone and holding what appear to be li- bation vessels in their hands, were also common features of Turkic burial sites. Not only did the hearth fire symbolize familial continuity, but the hearth also possessed great spatial and cosmological significance. Dug out by the mother, it implied a gate opened to the ancestor’s nether world. Centrally located in the round felt tent, it symbolized the center of the world. Through the smoke hole above, the hearth was on an axis with the cosmos. The sa- cred images of the Mountain, Tree, Cave, Water, and Female Spirit all became identified with the hearth through its cosmic orientation and through its opening into the nether world of the “grandmothers,” the ancestral fe- male spirits. The rites performed around the hearth helped to ensure kut, the life force that brought children to life, that fell through the smoke hole to bring good fortune to a family, or that conveyed the divine mandate to a ruler. Within such a spiritual frame of reference, as the Türk origin myths illustrate, the significant origin is not that of the universe or of humankind in general but of a specific family or kin group. The significant First Man is the progenitor, not of all humanity, but of one’s own people. Such a narra- tive can serve, then, as a “confederative charter” on which to unite a people or build an empire. Later narratives of religious conversion combine in the figure of the First Man both the faith-bringer and the forefather of a new kinship or ethnic group" <sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Candidate for largest scale ritual: ancestor rite of a ruling dynasty[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The religious rites of a ruling dynasty would have been more elaborate but not different in kind. The identification of sovereignty with control of sacred sites—an enduring theme in Turkic political culture—elaborated on the symbolism of the hearth. For the Türk Empire, this meant particularly the Ötüken mountain, which had also been sacred for the Xiongnu and the Rouran.86 Chinese sources mention Ötüken as the kaghan’s constant place of residence, in contrast to his subjects’ migratory habits, adding that each year the kaghan would “lead the nobles to the ancestral cave to offer sacri- fices.” If there was a difference in spiritual emphases between dynast and ordinary nomad, it took the form of the greater devotion to Tengri, the supreme deity, in the politicized state cult, with the kaghan as high priest.87 Tengri had two messenger gods (Yol tengri), of which one brought kut to the individual while the other restored the state, in which emperor and empress (kagan and khatun) ruled as earthly counterparts of Tengri and Umay, divinities of sky and earth. Rulers may also have had greater need than or- dinary folk for the services of shamans, especially to divine the future (or at least the rulers’ preferences concerning future policy). For the nonelite, other spirits, especially ancestral ones, may have been more meaningful.88" <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=KgWTurk&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ annual gathering ♥</b> "Like the Hsiung-nu, the Türk khagans held annual gatherings of regional chiefs, which helped bind together the various groups that made up the empire.

This suggests continuity between the Scythians, Khitan and Mongols, which in turn suggests that the blood brotherhood ritual was probably performed by peoples that inhabited Central Eurasia after the Scythians and before the Khitan - and these people may well have included the Xiungnu. "Herodotus also tells us that the Scythians give each other sworn pledges by pouring their blood, mixed with wine, into a bowl in which they dip a sword, arrows, an axe and a javelin before drinking from it. We may note that the use of arrows in making a 'blood-brother' agreement is evidenced in the case of Genghis Khan and also in East (or Chinese) Turkistan (now Sinkiang or Xinjiang in north-west China): there, as generally among the Turks and Mongols, the weapons represent the souls of men themselves." <sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> "Arrows (along with bows, saddles, horses, and gowns) also figure in ritual exchanges made between two men who agree to be blood-brothers." <sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup>.

Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (śīla): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> “Living a morally good life thus always brings a twofold benefit: Others are aided and one’s own spiritual development or karmic disposition is positively affected.

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’." <sup id="cite_ref-266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-266">[266]</a></sup> NOTE: Because the Turks also believed in a seemingly warlike god named Tengri<sup id="cite_ref-267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-267">[267]</a></sup>, it is not very clear to what extent Buddhist morality was truly adopted, either officially or unofficially.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21)." <sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup> <i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs." <sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-269">[269]</a></sup> NOTE: Because the Turks also believed in a seemingly warlike god named Tengri<sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-270">[270]</a></sup>, it is not very clear to what extent Buddhist morality was truly adopted, either officially or unofficially.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "This 'heaven-god' was called 'the Tengri of the Turks'.
