However, the Hsiung-nu vocabulary “recorded by Chinese belonged, in most cases, to the ‘upper’ functional style of the language of appropriate social formations that, probably, has not become the foregoer of the Turkic languages but, as it is typical of such functional styles, dissipated together with the society in which is functioned” (Dybo 2007: 199, 201). In either case, it should be remembered that the Xiongnu were polyethnic and polylingual nomadic empire. According to the written sources, the Xiongnu aristocracy included the Chinese counsellors and military commanders (most familiar of them is warlord Li Ling). The racial and ethnic tolerance is confirmed by the newest archaeological and genetic data (Kim et al. 2010). If, according to data of the physical anthropology, the Xiongnu of the Central and West Mongolia are close to the cultures of the Turkic circle then the Xiongnu of the East Mongolia bear many similarities to the Xiongnu of East Baikal area and Xienpi (Tumen 2011: 370)."

Between about 200 BCE and 100 CE, it was under the control of the Xiongnu Imperial Confederation.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]This polity comprised several nomadic peoples from the Mongolian Steppe. By the 4th century BCE, the Xiongnu  began raiding northern China,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_MnXngnL] where their mounted archery overwhelmed the heavily armed but relatively immobile Chinese infantry.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_MnXngnL] The nomads were held at bay by a combination of tribute in the form of metals, finished products, and agricultural products, and China's numerical superiority.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_MnXngnL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_MnXngnL][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_MnXngnL] Several Chinese victories against the Xiongnu in the 1st century BCE and factional conflict within the confederacy led to the confederacy’s breakup, and a new group of semi-nomadic peoples from the Northeast, the Xianbei, took control of the region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_MnXngnL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At their height, the Xiongnu ruled over an area that included all of Mongolia, extending to the Ordos region in the south, and the boreal forests of Siberia in the north, for a total of about 4,000,000 squared kilometres.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MnXngnL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Precise estimates could not be found for the empire's population, but estimates suggest that nomads living to the north of China did not number more than 1,500,000,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MnXngnL] and the best studied (but not the largest) settlement, Ivolga, likely had a population of between 2,500 and 3,000.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MnXngnL] The empire was divided into three kingships: a central one, directly ruled by the paramount leader, and a "left" one and a "right" one, to the east and west, respectively, distributed among twenty-four regional leaders known as the "ten thousand horsemen".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MnXngnL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Xiongnu Confederacy ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ NorthernXiongnu_100CE: 60BCE-100CE ♥</b>  NorthernXiongnu_100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MnXngnL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  1768561: 60BCE-100CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Xiongnu ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Xiongnu ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Xiongnu ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shamanism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Xiongnu Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Agathe Dupeyron ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MnXngnL&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [3,000,000-4,200,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers.  4 million km2 is the code for the Imperial Xiongnu Confederation which appears to still stand for this period, although I have changed it to a range from 3-4 million km2 to reflect some loss of control.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Before 50 B.C., the Xiongnu split into a northern and southern polity.

This provides a unique opportunity to observe the dynamics of the Xiongnu political institutions throughout 250 years. The most considerable differences between the power of the Mode/Maodun epoch and Xiongnu society before it collapsed are as follows:1. There has been a transition, from the triadic military-administrative division to dual tribal division into wings.2. Sima Qian wrote clearly about the development of the military- administrative structure with “chiefs of a ten thousand.” Fan Ye does not mention a decimal system; instead military rank of “chiefs of a ten thousand” are enumerated as civil titles of “king” (wang).3. According to Fan Ye, the whole first ten of “strong” “chiefs of a ten thousand” had, from the viewpoint of the Chinese chronicles, a more independent position from the shanyu headquarters.4. The order of succession to the throne had changed. While the shanyu's throne had ordinarily passed from father to son (with a few extraordinary exceptions), the order from uncle to nephew had now become predominant.5. The Xiongnu polity came to adopt a prevailing principle of joint government according to which the ruler of the nomadic empire had a co- ruler, who controlled one of the polity's wings. The capacity of become a junior co-ruler was held by birth; but a co-ruler's successors could not pretend to the shanyu's throne.These changes demonstrate a gradual weakening of the autocratic power of the center, and development of more diffused authority and federative relations, as demonstrated by, among other things, the transition from triadic administrative-territorial division to a dual one. The military-hierarchical relations were pressed back and the genealogical hierarchy between senior and junior by rank tribes was pushed into the foreground."

In the annals, they are mentioned, as a rule, as ‘subordinate kings’, ‘chief commandants’, ‘household administrators’, “juqu” officials21. Probably, a part of the ‘chiefs of a thousand’ were tribal chiefs. The ‘chiefs of a hundred’ and ‘chiefs of ten’ were, most likely, clan leaders of different ranks.

Here, the financial source of the functionaries is fed at the expense of their subjects as well as by wages from the center. Nomadic elites have always received presents from pastoralists. The chanyu of the Xiongnu had no money in order to pay wages to the chiefs and patriarchs, so he gave presents to their companions-in-arms. " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MnXngnL]  Probably 'governed population' (tribute)? But it seems that the chanyu also distributed tribute - state salary?  "One more sign of early statehood consists in the fact that a share of the sur- plus was requisitioned via levying of tribute and forced labor by the ruler. There is only one attempt known to impose taxes which was under the second Xiongnu chanyu Jiyu on the ad- vice of a Chinese adviser, castrate (Sima Qian 1959, ch. 110; Zhongyang 1958, 30; Taskin 1968, 45). However, there is no other information. Xiongnu society was based on an economy of gifts rather than on taxes, and the chanyu did not collect taxes from the pastoralists.

And this is because, originally, they were slaves of the Hsiung-nu.' Since "warfare is their business, '40 as Ssil-ma Ch'ien informs us, the acquisition of slaves for the market or for domestic use must have been an integral part of their economy.'"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_132_MnXngnL] However: "It is also unknown whether there were slaves. The apparent lack of development of slavery in the Xiongnu society can be explained by some cross-cultural anthropological studies that clearly demonstrate that slavery has never become widespread in any pastoral society (For details see Nieboer 1910: 261-293; Khazanov 1975: 133-148; 1984: 160- 161; Kradin 1992: 100-111). Those researchers are most likely right, who believe that the overwhelming majority of prisoners of war in the Xiongnu society were engaged in agricultural and handicraft in special established settlements (Gumilev I960: 147; Davydova 1975: 145; Rudenko 1969; Khazanov 1975: 143-144). However, as to their social-economic and legal position, the majority of these persons (many free deserters) were not enslaved. Their social status probably varied from conditional vassalage to some kind of serfdom. The Ivolginsk fortress (below Ivolga), near the city Ulan-Ude in Buryatia, was a classic settlement of such type (Davydova 1968; 1985; 1995; 1996; Hayashi 1984)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_133_MnXngnL] General reference for nomads: "Time and again the sources indicate that when large raiding parties attacked sedentary states they took away animals and people."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_134_MnXngnL] Referring to later periods: "Cross-cultural anthropological studies however demonstrate a lack of de- velopment of slavery in pastoral societies22. On the other hand, researchers have conjectured that the overwhelming majority of prisoners of war seem to have engaged in agricultural and handicraft production in specially established settlements (Gumilev 1960; Davydova 1975; Rudenko 1969). However, it would seem that the majority of the people, many of whom were free deserters from elsewhere, did not hold a socio-economic position equivalent to slaves. Social statuses of commoners most likely varied: from conditional vassalage to some semblance of serfdom." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_135_MnXngnL] Slightly earlier Chinese account: "When they fight in battle, those who have cut [enemy] heads or captured prisoners are presented with a cup of wine, and all the booty they have taken is also given to them; the people they capture are made into slaves.

(Barfield 1989, p. 59). In that year the Wuhuan attacked the Xiongnu and raided their royal tombs. The Xiongnu retaliated and won an easy victory, forcing the Wuhuan under their control. Following Xiongnu civil wars between 58 and 49 B.C., the Wuhuan reasserted their autonomy. Throughout their history, the Wuhuan were a major polity who engaged in a series of conflicts in China, often as an ally of one or another of the local warlords or as Chinese intermediaries against the Xiongnu (Gardiner and de Crespigny 1977)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_139_MnXngnL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]War against the Xianbei[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"This Hsien-pi attack wreaked havoc among the Northern Hsiung-nu, the above-mentioned surrender of 58 Hsiung-nu tribes to the Han being one direct major consequence. In 91, when the Northern shan-yii moved his court to the Hi Valley, it was the Hsien-pi who migrated into the territories in Outer Mongolia vacated by the Northern Hsiung-nu. In the latter half of the 2nd century, under the able leadership of T'an-shih-huai, the Hsien-pi expanded rapidly. Around this time, it is reported that the Hsien-pi "plundered the border of the Han in the south, blocked the Ting-ling in the north, pushed back barbarians in Fu-yii [in Manchuria] in the east, and attacked the Wu-sun in the west. They occupied all the former lands of the Hsiung-nu." The role of the Northern Hsiung-nu in Inner Asia was thus entirely taken over by the Hsien-pi."

However, in the fifth century BCE, Herodotus says they were performed by the Scythians [MAJIDBENAM_REF_229_MnXngnL] (typically the first people mentioned in histories of Central Eurasia, even though they never reached as far as our NGA), we know that the Khitan performed them in the tenth century at least [MAJIDBENAM_REF_230_MnXngnL], and we know that the Mongols performed them in subsequent centuries [MAJIDBENAM_REF_231_MnXngnL]. This suggests continuity between the Scythians, Khitan and Mongols, which in turn suggests that the blood brotherhood ritual was probably performed by peoples that inhabited Central Eurasia after the Scythians and before the Khitan - and these people may well have included the Xiungnu. "Herodotus also tells us that the Scythians give each other sworn pledges by pouring their blood, mixed with wine, into a bowl in which they dip a sword, arrows, an axe and a javelin before drinking from it. We may note that the use of arrows in making a 'blood-brother' agreement is evidenced in the case of Genghis Khan and also in East (or Chinese) Turkistan (now Sinkiang or Xinjiang in north-west China): there, as generally among the Turks and Mongols, the weapons represent the souls of men themselves." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_232_MnXngnL] "Arrows (along with bows, saddles, horses, and gowns) also figure in ritual exchanges made between two men who agree to be blood-brothers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_233_MnXngnL]. "Found in many Turco-Mongol nomadic societies, the ritual of blood brotherhood involved drinking from a cup into which blood from both parties had been poured. The 'brothers' would then exchange gifts and usually spend some time living in the same YURT, or <i>ger</i>. Blood brotherhood formed an important way of cementing political alliances."
