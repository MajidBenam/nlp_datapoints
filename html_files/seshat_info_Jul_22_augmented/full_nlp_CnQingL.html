Qing, Manchu Dynasty, Manchus, Jin, Jurchens, Ch'ing Dynasty) was China's last imperial dynasty. The founders of the Qing were descendants of Jurchen Jin rulers. The dynasty was founded by Nurhaci and then led by his son Huang Taiji, but did not become an imperial Chinese dynasty until after Huang Taiji's death.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_CnQingL] In 1644 CE, Qing forces captured the Ming capital at Beijing from rebels and held a funeral for the last Ming emperor to symbolize Qing inheritance of the Mandate of Heaven.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_CnQingL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Qing faced conflict with rebels and loyalist Ming forces for the next two decades.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CnQingL] Ming generals who surrendered were given power over large territories in southern China in exchange for loyalty to the Qing. In 1673 CE, leaders from three major southern feudatories led by Wu Sangui rebelled against Emperor Kangxi when he tried to reduce their power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_CnQingL] The Revolt of the Three Feudatories, as this episode is known, lasted eight years.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We divide the Qing Dynasty into two, an Early period (1644-1796 CE) and a Late period (1796-1912 CE). The division is marked by a period of internal turmoil as well as foreign incursions into its territory and economic sphere. In the Early Qing period, China had been prosperous under Kangxi and Qing rule, but by the time of the Opium Wars in the Late Qing, Western technology and industry had surpassed that of China.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_CnQingL] The fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 gave rise to the Republic of China.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]From 1850 to 1864 CE, China was racked by the fourteen-year Taiping Rebellion. The rebellion directly caused 30 million deaths and destroyed many regions in the middle and lower Yangtze.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CnQingL] In 1853, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace established a capital in Nanjing, but the rebellion was defeated by armies led by local governors in 1864.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnQingL] A number of serious uprisings followed the Taiping Rebellion, including the Nian Rebellion (1853-1868 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CnQingL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the same time, the Qing emperors were facing economic problems due to the actions of foreign powers. In the 1830s, British merchants began illegally importing opium to China, where high demand for the drug led to a large trade imbalance. China's economy was drained of silver[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CnQingL] and the value of copper coins depreciated.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnQingL] The First Opium War broke out in 1839 CE when a Chinese commissioner attempted to block opium trade in Guangzhou harbour.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnQingL] The Second Opium War of 1858 CE was a series of military actions by the British and French against the Qing.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnQingL] The resulting treaties allowed foreign powers to establish concessions in China, abolished taxes for French and British merchants, and forced the Qing to pay large amounts of silver in damages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnQingL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The 19th century saw increasingly frequent intrusions by foreign powers.

It is located 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) northwest of the walls of the Imperial City and was built in the 18th and early 19th century as the place where the emperors of the Qing dynasty resided and handled government affairs (the Forbidden City was used for formal ceremonies). The Old Summer Palace was known for its extensive collection of garden and building architectures and other works of art. Nearby and to the south was an extensive imperial hunting park known as "Nanyuan". In 1860 during the Second Opium War, two British envoys, a journalist for The Times and their small escort of British and Indian troopers met with the Royal Prince under a flag of truce to negotiate. They were imprisoned and tortured, resulting in twenty deaths. The British High Commissioner to China, Lord Elgin, retaliated by ordering the destruction of the palace, which was then carried out by British and French troops.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Special purpose sites ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ceremonial site ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Burial site ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Trading emporia ♣ present ♥</b> example to be provided</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Enclosures ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mines or quarries ♣ present ♥</b> Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_CnQingL] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Other site ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Information">Information</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=CnQingL&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Information">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div><b> Measurement System </b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Length ♣ present ♥</b> 1丈 = 10尺, 1尺 = 10寸, 1寸 = 10分</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Area ♣ present ♥</b> 1 mu (畝)= 0.1647 acre (0.1518 pre 1911); 6 mu (畝)= 1 acre[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Volume ♣ present ♥</b> 1石 = 2斛，1斛 = 5斗, 1斗 = 10升, 1升 = 10合</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Weight ♣ present ♥</b> 1 jin (chin/catty) = 1.1 lbs. 2 jin= 1 kilogram[MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Time ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Geometrical ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Other ♣ ♥</b><b>Writing System </b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ present ♥</b> E.g. abacus.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ present ♥</b> Paintings: "the Qing court commissioned a great number of battle paintings that commemorated important military victories" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ present ♥</b> e.g. historical archives and documents collected by the Hanlin Academy, Qing imperial archives [MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Script ♣ present ♥</b> e.g. Manchu script, Chinese script, Calligraphy [MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Non-phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ present ♥</b> Chinese</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Phonetic alphabetic writing ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ present ♥</b> e.g. tax collection and registration system <i>lichia</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Calendar ♣ present ♥</b> e.g. ritual calendar [MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sacred Texts ♣ present ♥</b> e.g. Sacred Edict, The Transformations of Wengchang [MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣ present ♥</b> e.g. Heavenly Kingdom literature [MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Practical literature ♣ present ♥</b> The <i>Qingshi gao</i> also included significant monographs on ritual, music, geography, food and commodities, law and punishments, civil service, the army, and foreign relations, as well as biographies on important confucian scholars, literary persons, and loyal subjects.

The scale of the massacre, which raged in Nanking for nearly a fortnight, apparently went far beyond anything Hung had envisioned.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_162_CnQingL]. “ In late 1859 the court had recognized, upon Tseng's insistence, how vital it was that Anking be recaptured, and Tseng now proceeded methodically to do so, entrusting the campaign to his brother, Tseng Kuo-ch'iian. On 5 September 1861, Anking fell after bitter fighting and with great slaughter of the civilian populace. Thus was laid the strategic foundation for the rebellion's defeat.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_163_CnQingL]. “ On 19 July 1864, Tseng Kuo-ch'iian breached the walls of Nanking, slaughtered its inhabitants, and burned the city. In this final cataclysm, some 100,000 are said to have perished.

After the images of the spirits had been prepared with incense and pieces of coloured paper placed in front of them, two musicians started to play the Chinese lute (Ch. <i>pipa</i>, Ma. <i>fifan</i>) and a kind of guitar (Ma. <i>tenggeri</i>). The master of ceremonies had two pigs stand outside the entrance of the Kunninggong. Then the shaman entered, wielding the ceremonial knife, and started to recite the prayers and perform the mandatory genuflections. Following this, two pigs were sacrificed, and purified water was poured into their ears. They were quartered, and their meat boiled and placed on a table. The shaman then recited more prayers to consecrate the meat. If the emperor and the empress attended the ceremony, they had to taste the meat; in their absence substitutes such as palace guards ate the food. Remains of the pigs were burned and buried in a sacred place. The evening sacrifices were addressed to the spirits of the ancestor (Ma. <i>murigan enduri</i>) of the imperial clan.

One could not apply for palace exams without having passed metropolitan exams, for metropolitan exams without having passed provincial exams, and for provincial exams without having passed local exams. All types of exams took place in prison-like compounds designed to curb cheating, all four involved questions regarding Confucian classics, poetry and national policy issues, and all four caused heightened anxiety in candidates [MAJIDBENAM_REF_381_CnQingL]. The palace exam has been chosen as the most dysphoric simply because its stakes were highest. "The exams were state occasions. Held triennially, the <i>jinshi</i> event constituted a high point in the capital's calendar with thousands participating, thousands more providing tutorial support, sustenance and encouragement, and yet more working as invigilators, scrutineers and assessors. To preclude cheating, each candidate was installed in his own wooden cubicle. His desk by day served as his couch by night, and for better supervision the lines of cubicles lay open along one side, like a row of latrines. Responsibility for the exam rested not with the Ministry of Personnel but the Ministry of Rites, and <i>jinshi</i> literally meaning 'presented shi', it included a final viva in the presence of the emperor himself. Once again, ritual underlay the whole system. Scholars, just like tribute-bearers, supposedly conformed to the cosmic pattern of attraction, being drawn into the imperial orbit by its sheer centrality. Their attendance affirmed its legitimacy and their distinction added lustre to its brilliance." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_382_CnQingL] "The anxiety from preparing for the Keju exams [which resulted in a <i>jinshi</i> degree] and the disappointment of doing poorly on them led to incidents of pathological behavior. Repeatedly failing the Keju exams took a severe psychological toll on the failed candidates. Effects of failure ranged from mild cases of self-doubt to various psychopathologies and, in some cases, to suicide or physical violence directed at others. In her analysis of classic exam-related novels, Judith Zeitlin found that physicians during the Ming dynasty had identified a specific form of anxiety-depression, called by these physicians <i>siyu</i> and referred to as 'male anxiety' by Benjamin Elman, that is associated with repeatedly failing the Keju exams. In the general literature, there have been many recorded cases of problems of delusions, illusions, and insanity attributed to failing the Keju exams repeatedly."

These expenses were far beyond the magistrate’s nominal salary to cover. The magistrate could meet these expenses by conducting “objectionable practices” or customary fees (lougui). Members of the Chinese bureaucracy tried to collected fees from every imaginable occasion to cover their expenses. Although the fees sounded to be low and irregular, it had become widely accepted and authorized. It was within the tolerance of the law and within the custom of society. But in reality, there was often no distinction between collection of customary fees and corruption. The system had been remained the standard practice to the end of the dynasty. At the provincial levels, there were some attempts made to regulate the practice by listing fees that were permissible. Nevertheless, they never succeeded simply because all levels of officials depended on customary fees which could be charged in numerous ways. The central government had never made any attempt because it hesitated to increase the tax rate. An increase in the tax rate sounded anti-Confucian as the Chinese classical explicitly advocated low taxation to reduce burdens of the Chinese people. The Manchu government used this cultural character to control Han Chinese people because any concrete corruption would not be perceived as a systematical corruption of the government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_486_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bribery ♣ significant ♥</b> All the positions subordinating to the governor of prefecture could be obtained by denoting, including the positions of military officers.

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_567_CnQingL] </i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_568_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended.

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_574_CnQingL]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other supernatural enforcement ♣ present ♥</b> Piety "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_576_CnQingL]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Human Enforcement of Morality</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (śīla): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

In many situations we can find ourselves busy analyzing a situation and what we are looking for is how this situation will harm or benefit ourselves.

Private ambitions must be subordinated to the loyalty one feels. Like filial piety, loyalty could include criticism. Confucius argued that it is one’s duty to object if a ruler is wrong. He said that if one is really loyal, really doing one’s duty, ‘how could you not instruct your ruler?’ As we have seen with filial piety above, criticism is permitted, if done reverently, though the results may be hard on the son or government minister. In a later text, the Book of Ritual, it is noted that a filial son may speak up to criticize his parents three times, but, if ignored, he is to follow their wishes. Similarly, it says, a government minister should speak to his ruler and offer advice and criticism. If after three attempts the ruler continues to ignore the min- ister, the minister should resign. The son cannot escape his relation to his parents, but a government minister is not related by blood to the ruler and so is permitted to leave the relationship if his advice is not taken.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_585_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “Even a first and superficial glance makes it clear that purifying, purification and actions or things that are considered pure play a decisive role in virtually all Chinese religions.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_586_CnQingL] Some brief notes on purity in Chinese Daoism.

The term goes back to the Bronze Age (and is not exclusive to Confucianism - indeed, virtually every Chinese ethical tradition had a concept of filial piety), but before Confucius it had referred to reverence for all ancestors, and mostly had to do with due sacrifice on their behalf. As with so many other moral and religious terms, Confucius and his followers radically reinterpreted it 5 to mean appropriate behaviour visà-vis one’s parents, and not only after their death. Merely providing sustenance was immediately disparaged as grotesquely inadequate: ‘Ziyou [i.e. the disciple Yan Yan, b. 506 bce] asked about filial piety. The Master said: “What is ‘filial’ nowadays refers to the ability to feed [one’s parents]. Even dogs and horses can be fed. If one is not reverent, wherein lies the difference?’ ( Analects 2.7) If one thinks filial piety consists primarily of feeding one’s parents, and not in cultivating one’s reverence, one is treating them like dogs and horses.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_587_CnQingL] “Filial piety achieves intellectual prominence as a Confucian concept, but it also informs Daoism and Chinese Buddhism.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_588_CnQingL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> In Buddhism, physical conflict was seen as undesirable, but, at the same time, an often necessary evil. “As we saw in the chapter on Buddhist Ethics (see Chapter 7) right conduct in thought, word and deed is characterised as peaceful and non-harming behaviour. That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_589_CnQingL] In Daoism: “From the very beginning of the written tradition of Taoism, there existed a close relation between it and Chinese military and practice. The ‘’Daode jing’’ contains passages that propounded ideas about the nature of warfare (that weapons are inauspicious implements; desolation follows an army) and the proper way for the ruler to engage in combat (conquer strength by manifesting weakness; do not value victory; do not attempt to dominate the world by force of arms) that were immensely influential in later times. [...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_590_CnQingL] Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures.
