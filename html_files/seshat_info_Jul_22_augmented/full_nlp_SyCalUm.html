[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_SyCalUm] In Egypt the adoption of Arabic as the language of local government took over 100 years.

The central government of the Umayyad Caliphate was almost non-existent at the start of the period but entered a more developed stage in the mid-8th century. One of the reasons for this lack of central administration was the exceptionally successful Arab-Muslim army combined with the existence of functioning bureaucracies in the former Sassanid and Byzantine domains, which were left largely intact.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_SyCalUm] Thus, under Muawiya - the first Ummayad Caliph - the  ruler was 'surrounded by Arab chiefs' with no other central administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_SyCalUm] At Damascus, an administrative system staffed by permanent officials[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_SyCalUm] dates from the reigns of al-Malik (685-705 CE) and al-Walid (705-715 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_SyCalUm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The caliphs, from their residence in Damascus (661-744 CE) and then Harran (744-750 CE), employed a chamberlain to manage visitors and regulate daily affairs,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_SyCalUm] and maintained an office of the chancery[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_SyCalUm] with officials called <i>diwans</i> to manage the collection of taxes and payment of salaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_SyCalUm] In order to impose their authority over the provinces, which had a combined population of up to 33 million,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_SyCalUm] the Umayyads typically sent civil and military governors (<i>amel</i> and <i>amir</i>).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_SyCalUm] In the regions they conquered, the Ummayads had no choice but to use the resident staff because institutions to train and educate bureaucrats had not yet developed in the Arab Muslim context. In Egypt, for the first century of Umayyad rule, 'all the provincial officials were Christians'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_SyCalUm] The Umayyad Caliphate was thus an exceptionally multicultural empire with a diverse governmental and cultural heritage.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]This diversity was reflected in the number of languages spoken across the territory conquered by Muslims: from Basque in the far west to Berber and African Romance languages along the southern shores of the Mediterranean, and Aramaic, Turkic, Hebrew, Armenian and Kurdish in the east.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_SyCalUm] The use of Arabic as an administrative language began in Iraq in 697 CE, but spread outwards to Syria, Egypt and, by 700 CE, Khurasan in modern-day northeastern Iran.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_SyCalUm] In Egypt, the adoption of Arabic as the language of local government took over 100 years; initially, almost all papyruses were written in Greek. The first known bilingual Greek-Arabic document dates to 643 CE, and the last to 719.

These Christians, formerly in the service of the East Roman exchequer, carried through vital financial reforms for the Caliphs. As the East Romans had done in the case of the great imperial army, they divided up the Arab tribes into separate katasters which registered all members of each particular tribe. ... They also had the idea of departing from Byzantine precedent which divided the land among the soldiers and settled them on it as military farmers. But they grouped them together in strongholds which were set up in districts which could supply their economic needs. Thus military establishments were placed in Kufa, Basra and Cairo (al-Fustat) because the troops garrisoned in these places could easily be provisioned from the fertile and highly developed countryside."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_SyCalUm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>_ Provincial line _[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 2.

However, the provincial line of government was extremely well-developed from the start because the Muslim-Arabs retained the bureaucracies of the Sasanids and Byzantines, and in fact also kept their administrators.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to Lapidus: the Muslim-Arabs: "Reconstructed the governing apparatuses of the Byzantine and Sasanid empires." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_SyCalUm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]One could therefore speculate the Caliph replaced the Sasanid provincial governors (the Shahrabs) with his own military chiefs and kept the e.g. Sasanid bureaucracy below it intact. In Iraq this may have been a Sasanid district called a shahr, which had its own chief or king and a government (further levels of complexity). A division within a shahr was called a rustag. There was a further division below this called a  "deh" run by a village headman. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_SyCalUm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Abbasids who followed the Umayyad's formalised a "hierarchy of districts" in Iraq, Iran and Egypt including the bottom unit called "rustag."

Demarcating a distinct command is effectively impossible as it was non existent. Tribal loyalty determined who men would follow over a title. Following a period of Civil war, the military was reformed under the reign of 'Abd al-Malik (685 CE-705 CE)to a more permanent system. This was not the case with the guards of the provincial cities and the Caliph, as indicated below.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Domestic Guardsmen[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Shurta (police) and the Haras (guards) were responsible for the securing the capital and maintaining the security of the Caliph and his family.

At the beginning of this period, these stipends could be thought of as the hereditary right of those whose names appeared in the diwan registers. During the course of the second/eighth century, the Caliphs and their representatives forced a transformation so that the stipend became a true salary, a payment for work done. Unlike their contemporaries in the West, the soldiers of the Caliphs were never given land grants in lieu of salaries. Sometimes they might be given houses or plots of land on which to build, but not to provide an alternative income. One the rare occasions when larger land grants were given to soldiers it was as a reward for past services, rather than payment for continuing and future ones. Both Umayyads and 'Abbasids normally maintained the separation of the military from tax-collecting: apart from dire emergencies, soldiers were never given the right to collect taxes with which to pay themselves. This was always done by the government diwans."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_SyCalUm][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Muqatila, translated as fighting men, were the cornerstone of the Umayyad Caliphates armed forces.

Certain originators of judiciary schools were awarded special titles, but these rare individuals were not the equivalent of saints.

However, to gain access to such a network required the right background and social network.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]However?[MAJIDBENAM_BR] There may not have been an explicit policy to promote on merit but the officials who ran the bureaucracies of the Caliphate were not picked based on their Muslim-Arab heritage. Both Arab and non-Arab were appointed as administrators.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_SyCalUm]  Arab-Muslims did not have the personnel to staff an empire and relied on local bureaucrats, who therefore kept their positions based on their skills rather than removed because they were conquered people.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] From the end of the 7th century "the business of government was conducted by professional administrators (both Arab and non-Arab) rather than by councils of Arab chiefs." However, the non-Arabs (except in Persia?) came to work in Arabic. "In the first decades of the Arab empire, administration had been carried out by Greek- and Persian-speaking officials inherited from the older Empires. By 700, however, a new generation of Arabic-speaking clients came to power - an indication of a broad process of Arabization in the region."[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Caliph Umar (717-720 CE) "believed that the domination of one ethnic caste over other peoples was un-Islamic.

The system was based on a group of mounted couriers and a large network of inns and stables connecting the capitol of Damascus to other cities, covering an distance of 4,000 miles from Algiers to Kabul. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_122_SyCalUm] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_SyCalUm] "The Muslim conquerors adop­ted many ancient institutions, including the postal system, which they called barīd. Although there is some controversy over whether it was primarily the Byzantine or Sasanid model that was followed (see, e.g. EI2, s.v. Barīd; Camb. Hist. Iran III/1, p. 564), it is probable that elements of both were taken over (Mez, p. 466). In the eastern part of the empire at least, ancient Persian practices and terminology seem to have prevailed."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_SyCalUm] For a detailed portrayal of Postal systems in the Pre-Modern Islamic world, see Adam J.

Ninety miles a day was claimed to have been achieved in during the Abbasid Caliphate. As the network was created in the Umayyad period, and at the largest distance covered 4,000 miles, it would have taken approximately 44 days to send a message by courier from one end of the empire to the other. Compared to a sailing time of six months from the Persian gulf to southern China, a distance of 4000 miles, the couriers seems to have been the fastest means of sending messages from the outside of the empire to the imperial centre.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_SyCalUm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Stephen Dean; Edward A L Turner ♥</b> <i>these codes were reviewed atSeshat Workshops, Oxford 2014 and 2017</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>  This polity was coded early, was the target of dedicated workshops, and had many experts look over it.

The only known exception may be on the Byzantine frontier. The available evidence points, rather, to a slow and uneven process of social and religious transformations...There are a number of reasons for the slow pace of conversions. The Arab-Muslim elite assumed that they would form a dual society in which the conquerors would constitute an aristocracy and the conquered peoples a subject population: the former Muslim, the latter not. Arab elites were resistant to the conversion of masses of people partly to defend their exclusive privileges and partly to preserve the full revenue base of the regime."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_224_SyCalUm]However, forced conversion did occur in Bukhara: "In 705, Qutayba crossed the Oxus with a Muslim army swollen with conscripts and mawali from Khorasan, the forces of Nezak from Badghis, and the dehqāns of Balkh, and secured the submission of Chaghaniyan. Paykand was taken in 706, Ramitin in 707, and Bukhara in 709 after heavy fighting. A tribute of 200,000 dirhams was imposed on Bukhara, a Muslim garrison was quartered in the city, and Tugh-shada, son of the khatun of Bukhara, was restored as ruler. The more wealthy local people built new villas for themselves outside the city.

This was led by ‘Abd Allah b.Mu‘awiya, not himself a descendant of ‘Ali but only of ‘Ali’sbrother Ja‘far. Ibn ‘Umar had been able to deal with the revolt inIraq, using the garrison of Syrian troops now established in al-Hira,but Ibn Mu‘awiya had fled to Istakhr in south-west Persia, fromwhere he was able to control large areas of western Persia, attractingassorted discontented elements to his cause. Marwan, meanwhile,could only attempt to weaken Ibn ‘Umar’s position in Iraq byappointing a Qaysi in the Syrian army there, Nadr b. Sa‘id al-Harashi, as his governor and hoping that he would be able to gainthe support of the ‘northerners’ (Mudar) in the Syrian army. Nadr b. Sa‘id established himself in Dayr Hind, a suburb of al-Hira, but theKalbi majority of the garrison continued to support Ibn ‘Umar in al-Hira. For several months there were skirmishes between the two, butthen the appearance of a Kharijite threat reduced this contestbetween the factions in the Syrian army to secondary importance.

The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba. Furthermore, it is important to remember that almost all reform movements in the fringe areas of the Islamic world were triggered off by the pilgrimage. Faithful believers from Bengal and Nigeria, from Morocco and Central Asia, who had lived for some time in Mecca and exchanged their views with others who, like them, had experienced what seemed to be the 'true Arabic Islam', returned to their Page 39countries to fight the numerous indigenous superstitions and customs which had infiltrated the Islam of the masses and which now appeared to them like remnants of ancient paganism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_227_SyCalUm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, although "a pilgrim can start going into consecration (<i>ihram</i>) for Hajj earlier, from the beginning of the tenth month (Shawwal)".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_228_SyCalUm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_229_SyCalUm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> The inhabitants of Mecca, Medina and other important waypoints along the pilgrimage may be considered as "passive spectators or witnesses", as the Seshat codebook puts it.

Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office.

Descriptions of the festival are surprisingly rare, especially as regards how it was celebrated in the past, but given that most Islamic practices demonstrate a great degree of continuity with the past, so descriptions of how the festival is celebrated in modern times may apply to how it was celebrated in the past as well. 'Id al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of the month-long Islamic fast known as Ramadan. "As in the Friday afternoon congregational prayer of the weekly Day of Assembly, the Eid morning prayers at the mosque should be preceded by a bath and attended with clean (often new) clothes. After breakfast, men, women, and children gather at an outdoor prayer meeting, the <i>musallah</i>, in front of a white wall adorned with a niche, the <i>mihraab</i> pointing in the direction of Mecca (like the one in every mosque). Women are given the option of praying at home--as they mostly do the rest of the year. The prayers consist of two units (<i>rakat</i>) plus the six-to-sixteen additional <i>takbir</i> recitations of <i>Allahu Akbar</i> ('God is Most Great'). These set them apart from Friday prayers, as does the fact that they are followed instead of preceded by a two-part sermon (<i>khutba</i>). [...] This enthusiasm erupts spontaneously on the aptly named <i>Eid-al-Fitr</i>, the festival of the breaking of the month-long Ramadan fast. Still, by then, passions have been so well trained that few unbridled excesses are in evidence at the happy family celebrations of warm community that follow or at the fairground attractions that are set up in some places [...]. Indeed, restored social harmony is on display everywhere over up to three days, with people greeting and congratulating each other in the streets as well as on afternoon visits to relatives, friends, and sick people. Many gifts are offered, particularly to the children of less fortunate families. At home, the family celebrates around a noontime festive meal [...]. Dead relatives are also remembered as their graves are visited that day." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_341_SyCalUm] There is also a specific type of charity given on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr, known as Zakat-ul-Fitr [MAJIDBENAM_REF_342_SyCalUm].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠

key ritual within the wider sequence of rituals that makes up the Hajj. “On the morning of the ninth, [pilgrims] proceed towards ‘Arafat, a plain 14.5km (nine miles) from Mina, where the central rite of the Hajj, wuqūf (standing) on ‘Arafāt, takes place between noon and sunset, during which time many heartfelt prayers are offered. The scene reminds Muslims of the gathering on the Day of Judgement. If any pilgrim misses this event, his/her Hajj is not valid and has to be done again another year. This does not apply to any other rite, all of which can be done over a longer period or compensated for with an offering. This is the time for the pilgrims to read the Qur’an, glorify God and pray most earnestly for forgiveness and everything else they wish for. Particularly recommended for glorification and repetition is this prayer, ‘There is no God but Allah alone, with no partner. Dominion and praise belong to Him, who gives life and death. Goodness is in His hands and He has power over everything.’ This just gives a succinct summary of the Islamic faith and connects the individual pilgrim to what Ibrahim and Muhammad brought and uttered. Pilgrims normally face towards the Ka‘ba while reciting these prayers, as they do for the five daily prayers, believing that, by doing this, their prayers are more likely to be accepted.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_377_SyCalUm]. This ritual is coded here as dysphoric due to the fact that pilgrims are required to stand for several hours (between noon and sunset) under the sun’s heat. A contemporary account, dating to 1997, notes that the “heat is virtually unbearable” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_378_SyCalUm]. However, it is worth noting that, due to peculiarities of the Islamic calendar, this ritual may sometimes be performed at a time of the year when the temperature is less hot than at other times, and when there are fewer others between noon and sunset than at other times. Moreover, a few informal online sources suggest that those who cannot stand in the sun for the duration of the ritual are allowed to be in the shade and/or sit down. Still, though relatively mild, this appears to be the most dysphoric ritual within Sunni Islam.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar [MAJIDBENAM_REF_379_SyCalUm].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_380_SyCalUm]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 6 ♥</b> hours, on average.

We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2;. In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice.

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives.

[...] In the history of Islam, the first religious waqf was the mosque of Quba' in Medina. It was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad in 622. Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar.

Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22).

In his ‘Tahdzhib Al-Akhlaq' he listed ‘wisdom' (hikmah), ‘courage' (shuja'ah), temperance (‘iffa) and ‘justice (‘adl) as the four cardinal virtues in Islam from which all virtues emanate.//Borrowing heavily from the Greeks, but working well within the established boundaries of the Islamic philosophical tradition, Miskawayh argues that justice, unlike wisdom, courage and temperance, has ‘no mean' between two extremes. In other words, it is an absolute value. Wisdome or prudence, on the other hand, is the mean between stupidity and arrogance, while courage is the mean between cowardice and bravado, and temperance being the mean between sloth and gluttony." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_559_SyCalUm] However, there are different types of courage, and, in this database, we are particularly interested in "the need to be strong, tough, brave, courageous, or heroic in battle or physical conflicts". In an excerpt from the same book, Bacchus provides this rather broad definition of courage, which may not quite correspond to what Seshat is interested in: "the quality of fury and indignation (al-quwwa al-ghadabiya), which may be described as a form of moral courage, neither rashness or hastiness (yahawwur) nor cowardice (jubn), but a state in the middle of the two. Guided by Kaw and Reason, courage urges man to conduct himself properly, pursue the right or straightforward path (al-siraat-al- Mutaqiim) and avoid the wrong.
