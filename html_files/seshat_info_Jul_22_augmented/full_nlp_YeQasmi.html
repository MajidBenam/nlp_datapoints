(Greenwich Mean Time 2004). The total land area of Yemen is 527,970 km2 including the islands of Perim and Socotra. The population was estimated at 19.2 M in 2003 (World Bank 2004). The highest elevation is 3760 m above sea level at Jabal-an-Nabi Shu’ayb. Most of the land is desert, with a hot and humid climate along the west coast, extraordinarily hot, dry and harsh desert in the eastern part, and a temperate climate with seasonal monsoons in the western hilly area.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_YeQasmi] 'Yemen occupies the southern shore and the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula. Its western boundary is the Red Sea. The country has a mountainous interior with a temperate or subtropical climate. The central highlands divide Yemen into a coastal plain called the Tihama, which has a tropical climate with sparse rainfall, and a desert region that stretches into the Empty Quarter. A midlands area consists of valleys (wadis) and foothills that slope down to the lowlands. Southwest monsoons influence Yemen's climate. THe southern highlands receive the most rainfall, particularly where mountains provide less of a barrier to precipitation.'

Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_YeQasmi] Dresch implies that the imamic capital was moved at least once: 'At times of truce, al-Qasim had acted against some of the tribes' own practices: for example, he put a stop to pilgrimages and sacrifices at a tree near Wadi Mawr and flogged men from alAhnurn for drinking (ibid. 338); his appointee even wheedled out of the tribes their 'books of tiighiit' and duly burned them (ibid. 435). Under al-Qasirn's successors, however, the tribes were treated carefully. Al-Mu'ayyad (1620-44), for example, seems not to have pressed the point of Islamic inheritance law and to have left the taxation of Barat in the hands of Bayt al-'Ansi, while his successor, al-Mutawakkil (1644-76), paid the tribes of Barat to support his campaign against Hadramawt (Serjeant 1983: 79-82). Aden and Lahj, which had already seceded, were retaken; a decade later alBaYQa' and Yafi' were subdued; Hadramawt was invaded; and the Zaydi arms were carried at one point to the borders of Dhufar in what is now Oman. The Qasimis also became involved in, though they did not conquer, areas north of Najran and 'Asir: 'the conquests spread with the support of the Hamdan tribes and the leadership of the Qasimi family' (al-Sharnahi 1972: 145), and alMutawakkil moved his capital from Shaharah to Dawran, south of San'a'. The state (now called a dawlah by its own chroniclers) had to link the north, where armed force still lay, to the richer tax base of Lower Yemen.'

The Ottoman Empire gained control of the region in the first half of the 16th century CE before being overthrown by the Qasimi dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_YeQasmi] The Qasimi dynasty ruled until the 19th century, when Yemen was divided up between the Ottomans in the north and the British in the south.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_YeQasmi] North Yemen became independent in 1918, while South Yemen did not gain its independence until decades later in 1967. The two countries were united in 1990.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_YeQasmi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the Qasimi period, Qasimid imams and their retainers and courtiers co-existed and occasionally competed with tribal shaykhs and their followers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders retained significant power, although the imams still collected taxes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_YeQasmi] Tribal authority remained important even under British and Ottoman rule. Some Yemeni leaders sided with the colonial powers, while others continued to resist.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_YeQasmi] Nor did the new government supplant autonomous tribal power after independence: the tribes were stronger than the new imamate, although they remained fragmented.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_YeQasmi] After 1962, when the imamate was overthrown, the new government created a more structured bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_YeQasmi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Secure population estimates for the Qasimi or colonial period in Yemen are lacking. In 1990, the population of Yemen was estimated at between 10 and 11 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_YeQasmi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Eva Brandl ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=YeQasmi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ ♥</b> in squared kilometers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b> People. </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b> Inhabitants. </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ ♥</b> in kilometers. </div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=YeQasmi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Hierarchical Complexity">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 3 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR](3) Capital cities; (2) Port cities and larger towns; (1) Rural towns and villages[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The following material was imported from the later data sheets. Most Yemenis lived in rural villages and towns: 'Yemen is an overwhelmingly rural country, with about three-fourths of the people living in the countryside. With only a few exceptions, the rural population is distributed fairly evenly. The monsoon rainfall that causes the western slopes of the massif to be so well-dissected makes the area the most densely populated part of the country. Fertile soils are another regional asset. In varying concentrations, Yemenis inhabit nearly all the country’s geographic zones - from sea level to 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) and higher. (In fact, the intricate variety of subregions and microclimates produces an agricultural base of astonishing diversity.) The scarcity of farmland has greatly influenced rural settlement and construction patterns, as has the need for security. Villages tend to be small, and buildings are erected on ground that cannot be cultivated - frequently along cliffs and rock outcroppings. Homes often consist of several stories (as many as five or more), with the lower floors being made of hand-hewn stone. Upper stories, where the family resides, are usually made of mud brick, a superior insulator. These quarters also have many windows, providing ventilation in the heat of the summer. The location of the living quarters in these upper stories offers the capacity for storage in the lower stories, as well as an element of security. Cities in Yemen follow patterns seen in other parts of the Arab world. Original construction consisted of a walled and fortified old city, in which the ornate multistory home was standard. The old city also contained shops, souks, schools, and mosques. In the modern period, urban areas began to sprawl outside the old city, and the wealthy began to build larger and more-ornate mansions and villas in nearby suburbs.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_YeQasmi] Specialists were concentrated in larger towns: 'But the ideological power of the Imamic state did not erase rural political idioms and leadership. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the economic power of urban forces remained circumscribed. Craft production and trade remained small-scale, and specialists were divided in status between those who ruled (families with literate and religious specialties or engaged in long-distance trading) and those who served (the craftsmen and market-service families). In the countryside arms-bearing farmers regarded the groups who worked in craft production, petty trading and market services as a dependent service class attached to their local political communities. Even in large towns the men who performed such occupations were distinguished as Jews or as Muslim strata (mazayinah, bani 'l-khums, nuqqas) marked by sumptuary customs or regulations. Literate specialists,  who sought to govern, to regulate the market, and to control long-distance trade, distinguished themselves from the labouring specialists of the market.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_YeQasmi] Cities served as economic and political centres and grew significantly only during the 20th century: 'Most Yemenis live in small, widely dispersed farming villages and towns. Three-quarters of the population lives in roughly 50,000 settlements with less than 500 inhabitants. The cities of Aden, Abyan, Al-Houta, Al-Hudaydah (a port), Sana, and Taizz have more than 100,000 residents each. Many foreign countries have assisted in the building of roads, hospitals, and schools, but improvements such as sanitary water facilities and power supply typically remain local development projects.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_YeQasmi] We have provisionally adopted a similar distinction while being aware of urban growth in the modern period. This remains in need of confirmation and more material is needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ 3 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR](3) Imams; (2) Retainers, advisers and other courtiers of imams; (1) Shaykhs and other tribal leaders[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Political authority was loose and fluid. Accordingly, it is difficult to establish precise hierarchies and the code provided is only a rought approximation. Dresch describes the establishment of the Qasimi court: 'Besides the wealth to be extracted from the southern peasantry, the Imams of the period also had available, if they could retain control, taxes from a burgeoning coffee trade. The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_YeQasmi] Leading shaykhly families rose to prominence in this period: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_YeQasmi] The relationship between imams and tribal leaders could be supportive as well as hostile: 'Sali1}. Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670). Then, after a disastrous attempt on Yafi' (in what is nowadays South Yemen), which resulted in Ibb being lost to the tribes of the eastern desert, al-Mawahib called to account the northern tribes who had failed him. In 1702 he sent his nephew to deal with 'Hamdan and their chief Ibn Hubaysh', but a truce was made instead (ibid. 428; Zabarah 1941: 297). Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_YeQasmi] 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_YeQasmi] Conflict between rival imams also occurred and tribal support could be decisive for the outcome: 'A few years later, in 1713, al-Husayn b. al-Qasim declared himself Imam in opposition to al-Mawahib, and 'Ali Hadi Hubaysh (probably Sali1}.'s brother) supported him (Zabarah 1941: 601-9). 'Ali al-Ahmar of al-Usayrnat was sent by al-Mawahib to oppose him (again, this is the first mention of the family by name), but the tribes preferred the new claimant (ibid. 356,607). The country was at one point divided among several of these rival Imams-although, significantly, none of them claimed control of the major tribes (ibid. 616)-and the struggle between.the different Qasimis dragged on, with the shaykhs holding the balance, until al-Mawahib died in 1718.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ... (al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_YeQasmi] 'As Stookey points out, al-Husayn's combination with the tribes against his father availed him little since when his father died, in the following year, and he claimed the Imamate himself under the title al-Mansiir, they supported his cousin, al-Nasir Muhammad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_YeQasmi] 'But al-jirafi goes on, more importantly, to relate that al-Ahmar wrote al-Mansur al-Husayn a brusque letter demanding a meeting. The Imam feared an attempt at assassination; so he'assassinated alAhmar first, stuck his head on a lance, and galloped off with it through a hail of bullets from the shaykh's enraged tribesmen (aljirafi 1951: 182). In fact, al-Ahrnar, accompanied by Bin juzaylan of DhU Muhammad and by Ahmad Muhammad Hubaysh of Sufyan, seems to have come to 'Asir, just outside San'a', to seek a settlement (Zabarah 1941: 539 and 1958: 486). The details are probably lost forever, and we are told only that al-Ahmar 'had wished to make independent his own rule of part of the country' (ibid.), which he very well may have done; but al-Mansur alHusayn's view of the matter, as recorded in the histories, has all the vigorous clarity of the Zaydi tradition. The taunt to the tribesmen at the time was, typically, that they were no better than polytheists: he brandished al-Ahmar's head on his spear and cried 'this is the head of your idol'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions millenarian militant movements: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam. Accounts of the rising mention several forts in the west being taken from Bayt al-Ahmar: al-Qahirah at alMahabishah was lost, then Qaradah and al-Gharnuq at Najrah, just south of Hajjah, then Sabrah, and finally the fort near alMadayir that al-Mansur had bought several years earlier (Zabarah 1941: 53-5). During the forty years since al-Mansur al-Husayn b. al-Qasim (a rival of al-Mawahib) came to power in 1712, says a contemporary witness, the state had counted for little: "The rule of 'All al-Ahmar and his sons after him and of other tribesmen from Hashid remained over-great and excessive until God destroyed what they had built and extinguished their flame, proclaiming their weakness and perdition by the appearance of this dervish. (Quoted ibid. 54)' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders held lands, collected taxes, and defended forts, enabling them to form a power base in their own right: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_YeQasmi] However, written records are often silent on these matters: 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_YeQasmi] In addition, sayyids also quarreled amongst themselves: 'AI-Mahdi al-iAbbas (1748-75) was very much a Sanani Imam, being based on the city throughout his reign. Among learned San'anis he retained a high reputation (al-Shawkani 19 29: 310-12; Serjeant 1983: 85 ff.), but it is plain that all was not well elsewhere. Abu 'Alamah's 175I rising in the north-west has already been mentioned. Two years earlier a campaign had been fought in Lower Yemen against a 'sorcerer' who promised his followers immunity against sword wounds and gun shots.V In the year before that, Hasan al-Tlkarn, of the qadi family from Barat and the north-east, was leading tribesmen at odds with the new Imam in Lower Yemen (Zabarah 1958: 684)Y In both the west and the south, the incursion of tribesmen over the preceding generation had not been quietly absorbed, and the affairs of the Barat tribes in particular (Dhii Muhammad and Dhu Husayn) became involved with those of the Imam's capital at San'a'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_YeQasmi] 'The connections of learning which were often important in an Imam's rise to power (Ch. 5) could also readily generalize a threat to that power if one emerged; and the language of equality, justice, and religious probity linked the learned with the tribesmen also. In 17 68, for instance, the 'ulamd' of Barat (particularly Bayt al-'Ansi) wrote to Zaydi centres such as Huth and Dhamar, calling for the expulsion of al-Mahdi al-Abbas and his Qasimi relatives on doctrinal grounds (al-jirafi 1951: 187; Zabarah 1958: 521-2; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 134-5), though the Barat tribes' incursions in preceding years suggest that doctrinal detail was not the main motive force (see e.g. Zabarah 1958: 13).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_YeQasmi] 'The Qasimis were accused of 'innovations' (bida'). Zaydism had always recognized ijtihad (the formation of new law by extrapolation from scripture), but in the mid-eighteenth century a pronounced movement of criticism was under way. Ibn al-Amir, for instance, a Zaydi scholar who kept his political distance from the Imamate, blurred the distinction between his own school and the Shafi'i,14 with the result that conspicuous details, such as postures of prayer, became matters of contention among those less learned than he. The Barat qadis blamed the Qasimis for supporting him. On at least one occasion, an intestine squabble among San'ani 'ulamd' over mosque appointments, phrased in these terms, led one faction to demand arbitration from al-'Ansi, 'the qadi of Hashid and Bakil' (Zabarah 1941: 617), rather than from their Qasimi rulers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_YeQasmi] Imams were often reduced to negotiate protection money with tribes under the threat of incursions: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mansiir 'All b. al-Mahdi (1775-1809) was, like his father, a San'ani Imam, and from the city's point of view was at first a considerable success (Serjeant 1983: 86-7; al-Shawkani 1929: i. 359 ff.). But at the state's periphery, Sharif Harniid of Abu Arish was forced south by the Nejd Wahhabis into territory the Imamate had held or at least had part access to. The resulting loss of port revenue was almost certainly serious. I? From now on, the Imams' ability to buy off the tribes declined sharply.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_YeQasmi] This lead to a gradual break-down of imamic authority: 'In 1823 a severe drought in the east forced a meeting of tribes at Jabal Barat, where they decided to seek aid from the Imam. When he refused and they turned on Lower Yemen, he seems to have been able to do nothing but warn others they were coming. 'When they reached Sarnarah [the pass that is sometimes taken to define Lower Yemen's border; see Chapter I], each put down his pledge on a place, and they divided it all up as if their father had left them the land as inheritance' (al-Hibshi 1980: 34). It is quite possible, of course, that many had indeed been left inheritance there, either property or presumed rights to 'fiefs' (quta'): they had been involved with the area for the best part of a century. From 1823 onwards, though, they are said to have held the area unopposed: 'they took control of it by force and coercion, then settled there, married there, and forgot the east until the Faqih Sa'Id threw them out in [1840]' (ibid.i.l" Even that was not sufficient, and when a further drought struck in 1835, Dhii Husayn, under Muhsin 'Ali alShayif, began raiding the north-west, while their women and children moved westwards by themselves in great numbers (ibid. 60-2). The Tiharnah had meanwhile fallen to the Egyptians.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, in San'a', the Imamate under al-Mansiir 'All b. alMahdi 'Abdullah lost not only its resources but its ~oral vigour: 'drunkenness was the prevailing vice among the higher orders, and ... the corpses of men, women and children lay about the streets, no one taking the trouble to bury them .. .' (Playfair 1859: 145)· Al-Mansiir squabbled with one of his relatives, who fled to Ta'izz and handed it over to the Egyptians. Al-Nasir 'Abdullah Ahsan was then raised to the Imamate by the soldiers in San'a', only to be assassinated at Wadi Dahr in 1840.19 Al-Hadi Muhammad took the throne and succeeded briefly in regaining Mocha and Ta'izz, but when the Egyptians withdrew-under indirect pressure from Britain (Baldry 1976: I6I)-the Tiharnah fell under the control of Sharif Husayn.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_YeQasmi] 'The geographical pattern of power had now changed beyond recognition. Hashid (led in part by the qadis of Bayt Hanash), were in Raymah, as well as further north in the western mountains, Dhii Muhammad and Dhii Husayn were in the south, as well as in the Tihamah, and all were involved with Yam, whose homeland in Najran had usually been outside the field of Yemeni events but whose presence in Haraz and the Tiharnah was nothing new. The land of Hashid and Bakil, on the northern plateau, was itself a dead centre to the whirl of events involving tribesmen elsewhere. Sharif Husayn's movements in 1845 make the point: starting from the north-west, in the Tihamah, he moved to the south, around Ta'izz, then to Barat, in the extreme north-east (al-Hibshi 1980: 120-31). The Imamate, at San'a', retained a mere rump of territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_YeQasmi] 'There was -violence enough in the north itself, particularly in times of drought (see e.g. ibid. 306); but the tribal divisions, one should note, changed very little, and then rather in a longue duree than in the order of events recorded year by year. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the geographical detail even of sections within tribes changes hardly at all from al-Qasim's time (early seventeenth century) to our own, and where change occurs it does so by recognizable quanta. Inequality and movement alike are registered in other terms. The prominence of major shaykhs, for instance, whom the tribesmen followed much as they did Imams, derived from wealth in the west and in Lower Yemen, and this is also where the great non-quantum shifts in territorial control resulted from tribesmen fighting each other. Inequality, power, and geographical change all attach, not to tribal self-definition, but to the history of successive Imams, to the history of a tradition or of a dynasty; and the dynasty had, by this point, collapsed because it had lost control of non-tribal land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_YeQasmi] 'The Imams' attempts to regain the south met with little success. Ahmad Salih Thawabah of Dhu Muhammad, who had controlled a large&nbsp;;wa~he of Lower Yemen, was defeated by al-Mutawakkil Muhammad and finally executed in 1848, to the delight of the Imam's supporters (Dresch 1987b). Within three years, however, his sons were formally granted land in much the same area (al-Hibshi 1980: 166). In the interim the Imam had been forced to send Dhii Muhammad horses as slaughter-beasts ('aqa'ir), which they took but did not have killed, and then pay them to fight again in the south (ibid. 146).20 Dhu Muhammad, Dhii Husayn, Arhab, Khawlan, and Hashid were also all fighting in the west, on the Imam's side, the Sharif's, or both; but the Ottoman Turks now seized the Tihamah. Hufash, near al-Mahwit, and al-Haymah were both contested, and several rival claimants to the Imamate appeared at once.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_YeQasmi] This enabled the eventual Ottoman re-conquest: 'In despair al-Mutawakkil asked the Turks to intervene in the highlands. They arrived at San'a' in 1849 with 1,200 foot and 500 horse, but a riot ensued and they withdrew after only three weeks (Zabarah 1929: ii, 346 ff.; al-Sayaghi 1978: 25-7). AlMutawakkil was killed by his rivals. One of the Ashraf of the northern Tihamah, supported by 'a large following from Hashid, was then bought off with a gift of 2,000 riyals, robes of honour, and a horse (al-Sayaghi 1978: 31). The combination of a Tihamah Sharif and Hashid at the gates of San'a' is symptomatic enough of the Imamate's weakness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_YeQasmi] 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO). They were to remain in highland Yemen until 19 18.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_YeQasmi] 'For much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, then, Yemen had been plagued by disputes between rival Imams and by tribal disorder. The Imamate had taken the form of an elaborate dynastic state, yet failed to secure the means to support itself or to transmit authority without dispute. Al-Shamahi credits the Qasimi dawlah with surviving until the middle of the nineteenth century. In name it did. He rationalizes the great decline of its power by saying that al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad (d. 1686) was the last of the Qasimis to possess all the qualities needed of an Imam, and that the rulers after him were more like kings (al-Shamahi 1972: 144-6). Similarly, al-Wazir (1971: 50) attributes the collapse of the state to the appearance of 'evil Imams'. Authors writing nearer the time each choose some point at which the real decline starts, always simply by reference to the actions or fate of a particular Imam (e.g. al-Hibshi 1980: 193).'

Islam is the state religion, and the Sunni branch of Islam, represented by the Shāfiʿī school, predominates. The Shīʿite minority consists of the Zaydī school, which has long been politically dominant in the mountainous highlands of the north, and the Ismāʿīlīs, now a relatively small group found in the Haraz region of northern Yemen and in Jabal Manakhah, the mountainous area west of Sanaa. The non-Muslim community is very small, consisting mostly of foreign visitors and workers. All are free to worship as they wish - including the Jewish community - but, as in most conservative Muslim countries, proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is illegal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_YeQasmi] Yemen has a history of religious militancy: 'Yemen’s distance from any Islamic central authority has made it historically an attractive haven for militant offshoots of normative Sunni Islam, particularly the two smaller branches of Shi˜ism: Ismaili, or “Sevener,” Shi˜ism, and Zaydi, or “Fiver,” Shi˜ism. Zaydism was established in Yemen by the imam Yahya al-Hadi (d. 911), a descendant of ˜Ali’s son Hasan who migrated from Medina to Yemen late in the ninth century and established his capital at the northern highland city of Sa˜da.1 Unlike Ismaili or Twelver Shi˜ite doctrine, Zaydi theology posits an active, visible imam, or leader of the Muslim community, descended from either Hasan or his brother Husayn, who is learned in the religious sciences and who publicly proves himself worthy of leading the Muslim community, in battle if necessary.2 What this has meant in Yemeni history is that scions of numerous lines of Hasanid and, less frequently, Husaynid descendants have proclaimed their da˜was, or “calls” - occasionally simultaneously, so that the supporters of one line were obliged to fight it out with supporters of another.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_YeQasmi] While Yemen was nominally under the control of a Zaydi imamic dynasty, sayyids also quarreled amongst themselves: 'AI-Mahdi al-iAbbas (1748-75) was very much a Sanani Imam, being based on the city throughout his reign. Among learned San'anis he retained a high reputation (al-Shawkani 19 29: 310-12; Serjeant 1983: 85 ff.), but it is plain that all was not well elsewhere. Abu 'Alamah's 175I rising in the north-west has already been mentioned. Two years earlier a campaign had been fought in Lower Yemen against a 'sorcerer' who promised his followers immunity against sword wounds and gun shots.V In the year before that, Hasan al-Tlkarn, of the qadi family from Barat and the north-east, was leading tribesmen at odds with the new Imam in Lower Yemen (Zabarah 1958: 684)Y In both the west and the south, the incursion of tribesmen over the preceding generation had not been quietly absorbed, and the affairs of the Barat tribes in particular (Dhii Muhammad and Dhu Husayn) became involved with those of the Imam's capital at San'a'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_YeQasmi] 'The connections of learning which were often important in an Imam's rise to power (Ch. 5) could also readily generalize a threat to that power if one emerged; and the language of equality, justice, and religious probity linked the learned with the tribesmen also. In 17 68, for instance, the 'ulamd' of Barat (particularly Bayt al-'Ansi) wrote to Zaydi centres such as Huth and Dhamar, calling for the expulsion of al-Mahdi al-Abbas and his Qasimi relatives on doctrinal grounds (al-jirafi 1951: 187; Zabarah 1958: 521-2; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 134-5), though the Barat tribes' incursions in preceding years suggest that doctrinal detail was not the main motive force (see e.g. Zabarah 1958: 13).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_YeQasmi] 'The Qasimis were accused of 'innovations' (bida'). Zaydism had always recognized ijtihad (the formation of new law by extrapolation from scripture), but in the mid-eighteenth century a pronounced movement of criticism was under way. Ibn al-Amir, for instance, a Zaydi scholar who kept his political distance from the Imamate, blurred the distinction between his own school and the Shafi'i,14 with the result that conspicuous details, such as postures of prayer, became matters of contention among those less learned than he. The Barat qadis blamed the Qasimis for supporting him. On at least one occasion, an intestine squabble among San'ani 'ulamd' over mosque appointments, phrased in these terms, led one faction to demand arbitration from al-'Ansi, 'the qadi of Hashid and Bakil' (Zabarah 1941: 617), rather than from their Qasimi rulers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions millenarian militant movements: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam. Accounts of the rising mention several forts in the west being taken from Bayt al-Ahmar: al-Qahirah at alMahabishah was lost, then Qaradah and al-Gharnuq at Najrah, just south of Hajjah, then Sabrah, and finally the fort near alMadayir that al-Mansur had bought several years earlier (Zabarah 1941: 53-5). During the forty years since al-Mansur al-Husayn b. al-Qasim (a rival of al-Mawahib) came to power in 1712, says a contemporary witness, the state had counted for little: "The rule of 'All al-Ahmar and his sons after him and of other tribesmen from Hashid remained over-great and excessive until God destroyed what they had built and extinguished their flame, proclaiming their weakness and perdition by the appearance of this dervish. (Quoted ibid. 54)' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_YeQasmi] Accordingly we have opted for a rough approximation of the complex religious landscape of Yemen for the time being. More material is needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 4 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR](4) Imams and their advisers; (3) retainers; (2) Shaykhs and other tribal leaders; (1) Armed tribesmen[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Political and military authority was loose and fluid. Accordingly, it is difficult to establish precise hierarchies and the code provided is only a rought approximation. Dresch describes the emergence of the Qasimid court, including the establishment of a retainer army: 'Besides the wealth to be extracted from the southern peasantry, the Imams of the period also had available, if they could retain control, taxes from a burgeoning coffee trade. The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_66_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_67_YeQasmi] Leading shaykhly families rose to prominence in this period, partly due to the military support they had provided to the Qasimids in their anti-Ottoman campaigns: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_68_YeQasmi] The relationship between imams and tribal leaders could be supportive as well as hostile, in both political and military terms: 'Sali1}. Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670). Then, after a disastrous attempt on Yafi' (in what is nowadays South Yemen), which resulted in Ibb being lost to the tribes of the eastern desert, al-Mawahib called to account the northern tribes who had failed him. In 1702 he sent his nephew to deal with 'Hamdan and their chief Ibn Hubaysh', but a truce was made instead (ibid. 428; Zabarah 1941: 297). Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_69_YeQasmi] 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_YeQasmi] Conflict between rival imams also occurred and tribal military support could be decisive for the outcome: 'A few years later, in 1713, al-Husayn b. al-Qasim declared himself Imam in opposition to al-Mawahib, and 'Ali Hadi Hubaysh (probably Sali1}.'s brother) supported him (Zabarah 1941: 601-9). 'Ali al-Ahmar of al-Usayrnat was sent by al-Mawahib to oppose him (again, this is the first mention of the family by name), but the tribes preferred the new claimant (ibid. 356,607). The country was at one point divided among several of these rival Imams-although, significantly, none of them claimed control of the major tribes (ibid. 616)-and the struggle between.the different Qasimis dragged on, with the shaykhs holding the balance, until al-Mawahib died in 1718.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_71_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ... (al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_72_YeQasmi] 'As Stookey points out, al-Husayn's combination with the tribes against his father availed him little since when his father died, in the following year, and he claimed the Imamate himself under the title al-Mansiir, they supported his cousin, al-Nasir Muhammad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_73_YeQasmi] 'But al-jirafi goes on, more importantly, to relate that al-Ahmar wrote al-Mansur al-Husayn a brusque letter demanding a meeting. The Imam feared an attempt at assassination; so he'assassinated alAhmar first, stuck his head on a lance, and galloped off with it through a hail of bullets from the shaykh's enraged tribesmen (aljirafi 1951: 182). In fact, al-Ahrnar, accompanied by Bin juzaylan of DhU Muhammad and by Ahmad Muhammad Hubaysh of Sufyan, seems to have come to 'Asir, just outside San'a', to seek a settlement (Zabarah 1941: 539 and 1958: 486). The details are probably lost forever, and we are told only that al-Ahmar 'had wished to make independent his own rule of part of the country' (ibid.), which he very well may have done; but al-Mansur alHusayn's view of the matter, as recorded in the histories, has all the vigorous clarity of the Zaydi tradition. The taunt to the tribesmen at the time was, typically, that they were no better than polytheists: he brandished al-Ahmar's head on his spear and cried 'this is the head of your idol'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_74_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions millenarian militant movements: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam.

(Quoted ibid. 54)' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders held lands, collected taxes, and defended forts, enabling them to form a power base in their own right: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_YeQasmi] However, written records are often silent on these matters: 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_YeQasmi] In addition, sayyids also quarreled amongst themselves: 'AI-Mahdi al-iAbbas (1748-75) was very much a Sanani Imam, being based on the city throughout his reign. Among learned San'anis he retained a high reputation (al-Shawkani 19 29: 310-12; Serjeant 1983: 85 ff.), but it is plain that all was not well elsewhere. Abu 'Alamah's 175I rising in the north-west has already been mentioned. Two years earlier a campaign had been fought in Lower Yemen against a 'sorcerer' who promised his followers immunity against sword wounds and gun shots.V In the year before that, Hasan al-Tlkarn, of the qadi family from Barat and the north-east, was leading tribesmen at odds with the new Imam in Lower Yemen (Zabarah 1958: 684)Y In both the west and the south, the incursion of tribesmen over the preceding generation had not been quietly absorbed, and the affairs of the Barat tribes in particular (Dhii Muhammad and Dhu Husayn) became involved with those of the Imam's capital at San'a'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_YeQasmi] 'The connections of learning which were often important in an Imam's rise to power (Ch. 5) could also readily generalize a threat to that power if one emerged; and the language of equality, justice, and religious probity linked the learned with the tribesmen also.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_YeQasmi] 'The Qasimis were accused of 'innovations' (bida'). Zaydism had always recognized ijtihad (the formation of new law by extrapolation from scripture), but in the mid-eighteenth century a pronounced movement of criticism was under way. Ibn al-Amir, for instance, a Zaydi scholar who kept his political distance from the Imamate, blurred the distinction between his own school and the Shafi'i,14 with the result that conspicuous details, such as postures of prayer, became matters of contention among those less learned than he. The Barat qadis blamed the Qasimis for supporting him. On at least one occasion, an intestine squabble among San'ani 'ulamd' over mosque appointments, phrased in these terms, led one faction to demand arbitration from al-'Ansi, 'the qadi of Hashid and Bakil' (Zabarah 1941: 617), rather than from their Qasimi rulers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_YeQasmi] Imams were often reduced to negotiate protection money with tribes under the threat of military incursions: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mansiir 'All b. al-Mahdi (1775-1809) was, like his father, a San'ani Imam, and from the city's point of view was at first a considerable success (Serjeant 1983: 86-7; al-Shawkani 1929: i. 359 ff.). But at the state's periphery, Sharif Harniid of Abu Arish was forced south by the Nejd Wahhabis into territory the Imamate had held or at least had part access to. The resulting loss of port revenue was almost certainly serious. I? From now on, the Imams' ability to buy off the tribes declined sharply.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_YeQasmi] This lead to a gradual break-down of imamic authority: 'In 1823 a severe drought in the east forced a meeting of tribes at Jabal Barat, where they decided to seek aid from the Imam. When he refused and they turned on Lower Yemen, he seems to have been able to do nothing but warn others they were coming. 'When they reached Sarnarah [the pass that is sometimes taken to define Lower Yemen's border; see Chapter I], each put down his pledge on a place, and they divided it all up as if their father had left them the land as inheritance' (al-Hibshi 1980: 34). It is quite possible, of course, that many had indeed been left inheritance there, either property or presumed rights to 'fiefs' (quta'): they had been involved with the area for the best part of a century. From 1823 onwards, though, they are said to have held the area unopposed: 'they took control of it by force and coercion, then settled there, married there, and forgot the east until the Faqih Sa'Id threw them out in [1840]' (ibid.i.l" Even that was not sufficient, and when a further drought struck in 1835, Dhii Husayn, under Muhsin 'Ali alShayif, began raiding the north-west, while their women and children moved westwards by themselves in great numbers (ibid. 60-2). The Tiharnah had meanwhile fallen to the Egyptians.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, in San'a', the Imamate under al-Mansiir 'All b. alMahdi 'Abdullah lost not only its resources but its ~oral vigour: 'drunkenness was the prevailing vice among the higher orders, and ... the corpses of men, women and children lay about the streets, no one taking the trouble to bury them .. .' (Playfair 1859: 145)· Al-Mansiir squabbled with one of his relatives, who fled to Ta'izz and handed it over to the Egyptians. Al-Nasir 'Abdullah Ahsan was then raised to the Imamate by the soldiers in San'a', only to be assassinated at Wadi Dahr in 1840.19 Al-Hadi Muhammad took the throne and succeeded briefly in regaining Mocha and Ta'izz, but when the Egyptians withdrew-under indirect pressure from Britain (Baldry 1976: I6I)-the Tiharnah fell under the control of Sharif Husayn.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_YeQasmi] 'The geographical pattern of power had now changed beyond recognition. Hashid (led in part by the qadis of Bayt Hanash), were in Raymah, as well as further north in the western mountains, Dhii Muhammad and Dhii Husayn were in the south, as well as in the Tihamah, and all were involved with Yam, whose homeland in Najran had usually been outside the field of Yemeni events but whose presence in Haraz and the Tiharnah was nothing new. The land of Hashid and Bakil, on the northern plateau, was itself a dead centre to the whirl of events involving tribesmen elsewhere. Sharif Husayn's movements in 1845 make the point: starting from the north-west, in the Tihamah, he moved to the south, around Ta'izz, then to Barat, in the extreme north-east (al-Hibshi 1980: 120-31). The Imamate, at San'a', retained a mere rump of territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_YeQasmi] 'There was -violence enough in the north itself, particularly in times of drought (see e.g. ibid. 306); but the tribal divisions, one should note, changed very little, and then rather in a longue duree than in the order of events recorded year by year. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the geographical detail even of sections within tribes changes hardly at all from al-Qasim's time (early seventeenth century) to our own, and where change occurs it does so by recognizable quanta. Inequality and movement alike are registered in other terms. The prominence of major shaykhs, for instance, whom the tribesmen followed much as they did Imams, derived from wealth in the west and in Lower Yemen, and this is also where the great non-quantum shifts in territorial control resulted from tribesmen fighting each other. Inequality, power, and geographical change all attach, not to tribal self-definition, but to the history of successive Imams, to the history of a tradition or of a dynasty; and the dynasty had, by this point, collapsed because it had lost control of non-tribal land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_88_YeQasmi] 'The Imams' attempts to regain the south met with little success. Ahmad Salih Thawabah of Dhu Muhammad, who had controlled a large&nbsp;;wa~he of Lower Yemen, was defeated by al-Mutawakkil Muhammad and finally executed in 1848, to the delight of the Imam's supporters (Dresch 1987b). Within three years, however, his sons were formally granted land in much the same area (al-Hibshi 1980: 166). In the interim the Imam had been forced to send Dhii Muhammad horses as slaughter-beasts ('aqa'ir), which they took but did not have killed, and then pay them to fight again in the south (ibid. 146).20 Dhu Muhammad, Dhii Husayn, Arhab, Khawlan, and Hashid were also all fighting in the west, on the Imam's side, the Sharif's, or both; but the Ottoman Turks now seized the Tihamah. Hufash, near al-Mahwit, and al-Haymah were both contested, and several rival claimants to the Imamate appeared at once.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_YeQasmi] This enabled the eventual Ottoman re-conquest: 'In despair al-Mutawakkil asked the Turks to intervene in the highlands. They arrived at San'a' in 1849 with 1,200 foot and 500 horse, but a riot ensued and they withdrew after only three weeks (Zabarah 1929: ii, 346 ff.; al-Sayaghi 1978: 25-7). AlMutawakkil was killed by his rivals.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_YeQasmi] 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO).

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_91_YeQasmi] 'For much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, then, Yemen had been plagued by disputes between rival Imams and by tribal disorder. The Imamate had taken the form of an elaborate dynastic state, yet failed to secure the means to support itself or to transmit authority without dispute. Al-Shamahi credits the Qasimi dawlah with surviving until the middle of the nineteenth century. In name it did. He rationalizes the great decline of its power by saying that al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad (d. 1686) was the last of the Qasimis to possess all the qualities needed of an Imam, and that the rulers after him were more like kings (al-Shamahi 1972: 144-6). Similarly, al-Wazir (1971: 50) attributes the collapse of the state to the appearance of 'evil Imams'. Authors writing nearer the time each choose some point at which the real decline starts, always simply by reference to the actions or fate of a particular Imam (e.g. al-Hibshi 1980: 193).'

One is reminded of a similar double resonance of the English word “court,” held by both kings and judges.

Muwajaha was also the format in which the mufti received afternoon fatwa seekers, and the same sort of generic activity was characteristic as well of both ruling imams and local governors.

From the time of the Turks (1636) to that of al-Mahdi of al-Mawahib (1687) Yemen supposedly 'was spared hunger and strife, and that wealth was taken which the law permits'. (As we have seen, this is too rosy a view; but the perception is what concerns us.) 'When this man [alMawahib] arose he took what wealth is permitted and what is not permitted. His state grew strong, his prestige became great, his power expanded, the number of his troops increased, and he became more like a king than a caliph' (al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 298). Yet the control of such wealth from taxation was surely vital where the country's agricultural. base was so vulnerable; as in 1723-4, for instance, when "a drought struck San'a' and most of the mountains of Yemen. Most people (sic. akthar al-niis) died of hunger and the villages were emptied of their inhabitants ... People ate even carrion. The price of all grains rose and a qadab reached eight [silver] riyals. Prosperous people gave what they had as alms. AI-Mutawakkil Qasirn b. al-Husayn gave out all that was edible from his store-houses ... and it was distributed among the poor in the alleyways of San'a'. Then there was abundance at the start of the next year [i.e. from the end of summer 1724], which went on until prices reached four qadahs of wheat for only one riyal, or six of sorghum, or eight of barley. Praise God, then, the Lord of the worlds. (Zabarah 1941: 588)" The role of the Imams' public store-houses in smoothing such fluctuations would be an interesting subject. But what is important for the present purpose is the concept of generosity at work here.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_106_YeQasmi] But Jews were excluded from this after the emergence of a Messianic movement: 'Various natural disasters, especially a severe drought. that struck Yemen in the years following the execution of Jamal reinforced the opinion among Ihe Muslims in Yemen that the country was being punished for the act.

This calamity struck the Jews in panicular, not only on account of the economic structure of the country, in which they were chiefly anisans remote from farming, but also owing to their poverty resulting from the heavy fines imposed on them and the expropriation of their property two years previously. The government, as was its wont, exploited these terrible circumstances, and did not supply the Jews with grain from its stores unless they convened. And indeed, as Hamami,l04 "about five hundred or more of Israel altered their faith, and it was as the generation of apostasy owing to the poverty that was from the start and owing to the famine that visited the earth", 'Uzayri points out not only the great famine but also the wandering of the Jews from place (0 place in search of food, and the decrees imposed on them by the "kingdom of evil" precisely at the time of their woe.'

Substantively, the Quran and the Sunna, the practice of the Prophet, constituted the two fundamental “sources” (usul, sing. asl) for the elaboration of shariʽa jurisprudence. Discursively, the Quran represents both the end and the beginning of the kitab (text, scripture, writing, book). Just as Muhammad was the last, the “seal,” of the Prophets, and also the first Muslim, the Quran was the definitive and final kitab, whose particular authority would initiate and delimit a discursive tradition.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_120_YeQasmi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious literature ♣ present ♥</b> Scholars of Islamic law referred to biographical literature and legal manuals: 'For many centuries now, Ibb has supported an active community of Shafiʿi scholars. Despite their seemingly remote mountain valley location, town jurists were far from parochial. In terms of texts studied, theirs was not an unconventional local version of the shariʽa, Beginning with Ibn Samura and continuing to the present century, biographical histories provide views of the changing scholarly community in Ibb. A recently published work (Zabara 1979) devoted to noted individuals of the just-completed (fourteenth) Hegira century contains an entry on a distinguished Ibb scholar and prominent political figure who lived from 1876 to 1922, some seven and a half centuries after Faqih al-Nahi. Like al-Nahi, ʿAbd al-Rahman al-Haddad was an adherent of the Shafiʿi school of shariʽa jurisprudence. Both men were connected to the school through their relations with particular teachers and specific texts. In al-Haddad's case the teacher was his father, and the key text was a celebrated old manual known as Al-Minhaj. [...] Ibb scholars such as ʿAbd al-Rahman al-Haddad and, in the next generation, men such as his nephew and son-in-law, Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Haddad, whom I knew in the 1970s as an old man and a practicing court judge, commenced their higher studies with two standard Shafiʿi texts, the just-mentioned Al-Minhaj by Muhyi al-Din al-Nawawi, a Syrian who died in A.D. 1277,10 and a still more radically concise manual, known as Al-Mukhtasar (“the abridgment”) or simply as the matn, the “text,” of Abu Shuja, a resident of Basra active in the twelfth century.'

The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_122_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_YeQasmi] Shaykhs also collected funds from landholdings: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_YeQasmi] 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_126_YeQasmi] Taxation and stipends were a major bone of contention between imams and tribes: 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b.

(al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_YeQasmi] Dresch mentions tax registers: 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO). They were to remain in highland Yemen until 19 18.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_YeQasmi] More details on the currency used may be needed. Dresch mentions Riyals in his discussion of stipends: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_142_YeQasmi] 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam. Accounts of the rising mention several forts in the west being taken from Bayt al-Ahmar: al-Qahirah at alMahabishah was lost, then Qaradah and al-Gharnuq at Najrah, just south of Hajjah, then Sabrah, and finally the fort near alMadayir that al-Mansur had bought several years earlier (Zabarah 1941: 53-5).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_143_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau.'

Accordingly, the code does not reflect the complexity of the military landscape of Qasimid-period Yemen. Dresch describes the emergence of the Qasimid court, including the establishment of a retainer army: 'Besides the wealth to be extracted from the southern peasantry, the Imams of the period also had available, if they could retain control, taxes from a burgeoning coffee trade. The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_145_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_146_YeQasmi] Leading shaykhly families rose to prominence in this period, partly due to the military support they had provided to the Qasimids in their anti-Ottoman campaigns: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_147_YeQasmi] The relationship between imams and tribal leaders could be supportive as well as hostile, in both political and military terms: 'Sali1}. Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670). Then, after a disastrous attempt on Yafi' (in what is nowadays South Yemen), which resulted in Ibb being lost to the tribes of the eastern desert, al-Mawahib called to account the northern tribes who had failed him. In 1702 he sent his nephew to deal with 'Hamdan and their chief Ibn Hubaysh', but a truce was made instead (ibid. 428; Zabarah 1941: 297). Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_148_YeQasmi] 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_149_YeQasmi] Conflict between rival imams also occurred and tribal military support could be decisive for the outcome: 'A few years later, in 1713, al-Husayn b. al-Qasim declared himself Imam in opposition to al-Mawahib, and 'Ali Hadi Hubaysh (probably Sali1}.'s brother) supported him (Zabarah 1941: 601-9). 'Ali al-Ahmar of al-Usayrnat was sent by al-Mawahib to oppose him (again, this is the first mention of the family by name), but the tribes preferred the new claimant (ibid. 356,607). The country was at one point divided among several of these rival Imams-although, significantly, none of them claimed control of the major tribes (ibid. 616)-and the struggle between.the different Qasimis dragged on, with the shaykhs holding the balance, until al-Mawahib died in 1718.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_150_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ... (al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_151_YeQasmi] 'As Stookey points out, al-Husayn's combination with the tribes against his father availed him little since when his father died, in the following year, and he claimed the Imamate himself under the title al-Mansiir, they supported his cousin, al-Nasir Muhammad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_152_YeQasmi] 'But al-jirafi goes on, more importantly, to relate that al-Ahmar wrote al-Mansur al-Husayn a brusque letter demanding a meeting. The Imam feared an attempt at assassination; so he'assassinated alAhmar first, stuck his head on a lance, and galloped off with it through a hail of bullets from the shaykh's enraged tribesmen (aljirafi 1951: 182). In fact, al-Ahrnar, accompanied by Bin juzaylan of DhU Muhammad and by Ahmad Muhammad Hubaysh of Sufyan, seems to have come to 'Asir, just outside San'a', to seek a settlement (Zabarah 1941: 539 and 1958: 486). The details are probably lost forever, and we are told only that al-Ahmar 'had wished to make independent his own rule of part of the country' (ibid.), which he very well may have done; but al-Mansur alHusayn's view of the matter, as recorded in the histories, has all the vigorous clarity of the Zaydi tradition. The taunt to the tribesmen at the time was, typically, that they were no better than polytheists: he brandished al-Ahmar's head on his spear and cried 'this is the head of your idol'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_153_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions millenarian militant movements: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam. Accounts of the rising mention several forts in the west being taken from Bayt al-Ahmar: al-Qahirah at alMahabishah was lost, then Qaradah and al-Gharnuq at Najrah, just south of Hajjah, then Sabrah, and finally the fort near alMadayir that al-Mansur had bought several years earlier (Zabarah 1941: 53-5). During the forty years since al-Mansur al-Husayn b. al-Qasim (a rival of al-Mawahib) came to power in 1712, says a contemporary witness, the state had counted for little: "The rule of 'All al-Ahmar and his sons after him and of other tribesmen from Hashid remained over-great and excessive until God destroyed what they had built and extinguished their flame, proclaiming their weakness and perdition by the appearance of this dervish. (Quoted ibid. 54)' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_154_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders held lands, collected taxes, and defended forts, enabling them to form a power base in their own right: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_155_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_156_YeQasmi] However, written records are often silent on these matters: 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_157_YeQasmi] In addition, sayyids also quarreled amongst themselves: 'AI-Mahdi al-iAbbas (1748-75) was very much a Sanani Imam, being based on the city throughout his reign. Among learned San'anis he retained a high reputation (al-Shawkani 19 29: 310-12; Serjeant 1983: 85 ff.), but it is plain that all was not well elsewhere. Abu 'Alamah's 175I rising in the north-west has already been mentioned. Two years earlier a campaign had been fought in Lower Yemen against a 'sorcerer' who promised his followers immunity against sword wounds and gun shots.V In the year before that, Hasan al-Tlkarn, of the qadi family from Barat and the north-east, was leading tribesmen at odds with the new Imam in Lower Yemen (Zabarah 1958: 684)Y In both the west and the south, the incursion of tribesmen over the preceding generation had not been quietly absorbed, and the affairs of the Barat tribes in particular (Dhii Muhammad and Dhu Husayn) became involved with those of the Imam's capital at San'a'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_158_YeQasmi] 'The connections of learning which were often important in an Imam's rise to power (Ch. 5) could also readily generalize a threat to that power if one emerged; and the language of equality, justice, and religious probity linked the learned with the tribesmen also. In 17 68, for instance, the 'ulamd' of Barat (particularly Bayt al-'Ansi) wrote to Zaydi centres such as Huth and Dhamar, calling for the expulsion of al-Mahdi al-Abbas and his Qasimi relatives on doctrinal grounds (al-jirafi 1951: 187; Zabarah 1958: 521-2; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 134-5), though the Barat tribes' incursions in preceding years suggest that doctrinal detail was not the main motive force (see e.g. Zabarah 1958: 13).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_159_YeQasmi] 'The Qasimis were accused of 'innovations' (bida'). Zaydism had always recognized ijtihad (the formation of new law by extrapolation from scripture), but in the mid-eighteenth century a pronounced movement of criticism was under way. Ibn al-Amir, for instance, a Zaydi scholar who kept his political distance from the Imamate, blurred the distinction between his own school and the Shafi'i,14 with the result that conspicuous details, such as postures of prayer, became matters of contention among those less learned than he. The Barat qadis blamed the Qasimis for supporting him. On at least one occasion, an intestine squabble among San'ani 'ulamd' over mosque appointments, phrased in these terms, led one faction to demand arbitration from al-'Ansi, 'the qadi of Hashid and Bakil' (Zabarah 1941: 617), rather than from their Qasimi rulers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_160_YeQasmi] Imams were often reduced to negotiate protection money with tribes under the threat of military incursions: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_161_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mansiir 'All b. al-Mahdi (1775-1809) was, like his father, a San'ani Imam, and from the city's point of view was at first a considerable success (Serjeant 1983: 86-7; al-Shawkani 1929: i. 359 ff.). But at the state's periphery, Sharif Harniid of Abu Arish was forced south by the Nejd Wahhabis into territory the Imamate had held or at least had part access to. The resulting loss of port revenue was almost certainly serious. I? From now on, the Imams' ability to buy off the tribes declined sharply.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_162_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_163_YeQasmi] This lead to a gradual break-down of imamic authority: 'In 1823 a severe drought in the east forced a meeting of tribes at Jabal Barat, where they decided to seek aid from the Imam. When he refused and they turned on Lower Yemen, he seems to have been able to do nothing but warn others they were coming. 'When they reached Sarnarah [the pass that is sometimes taken to define Lower Yemen's border; see Chapter I], each put down his pledge on a place, and they divided it all up as if their father had left them the land as inheritance' (al-Hibshi 1980: 34). It is quite possible, of course, that many had indeed been left inheritance there, either property or presumed rights to 'fiefs' (quta'): they had been involved with the area for the best part of a century. From 1823 onwards, though, they are said to have held the area unopposed: 'they took control of it by force and coercion, then settled there, married there, and forgot the east until the Faqih Sa'Id threw them out in [1840]' (ibid.i.l" Even that was not sufficient, and when a further drought struck in 1835, Dhii Husayn, under Muhsin 'Ali alShayif, began raiding the north-west, while their women and children moved westwards by themselves in great numbers (ibid. 60-2). The Tiharnah had meanwhile fallen to the Egyptians.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_164_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, in San'a', the Imamate under al-Mansiir 'All b. alMahdi 'Abdullah lost not only its resources but its ~oral vigour: 'drunkenness was the prevailing vice among the higher orders, and ... the corpses of men, women and children lay about the streets, no one taking the trouble to bury them .. .' (Playfair 1859: 145)· Al-Mansiir squabbled with one of his relatives, who fled to Ta'izz and handed it over to the Egyptians. Al-Nasir 'Abdullah Ahsan was then raised to the Imamate by the soldiers in San'a', only to be assassinated at Wadi Dahr in 1840.19 Al-Hadi Muhammad took the throne and succeeded briefly in regaining Mocha and Ta'izz, but when the Egyptians withdrew-under indirect pressure from Britain (Baldry 1976: I6I)-the Tiharnah fell under the control of Sharif Husayn.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_165_YeQasmi] 'The geographical pattern of power had now changed beyond recognition. Hashid (led in part by the qadis of Bayt Hanash), were in Raymah, as well as further north in the western mountains, Dhii Muhammad and Dhii Husayn were in the south, as well as in the Tihamah, and all were involved with Yam, whose homeland in Najran had usually been outside the field of Yemeni events but whose presence in Haraz and the Tiharnah was nothing new. The land of Hashid and Bakil, on the northern plateau, was itself a dead centre to the whirl of events involving tribesmen elsewhere. Sharif Husayn's movements in 1845 make the point: starting from the north-west, in the Tihamah, he moved to the south, around Ta'izz, then to Barat, in the extreme north-east (al-Hibshi 1980: 120-31). The Imamate, at San'a', retained a mere rump of territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_166_YeQasmi] 'There was -violence enough in the north itself, particularly in times of drought (see e.g. ibid. 306); but the tribal divisions, one should note, changed very little, and then rather in a longue duree than in the order of events recorded year by year. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the geographical detail even of sections within tribes changes hardly at all from al-Qasim's time (early seventeenth century) to our own, and where change occurs it does so by recognizable quanta. Inequality and movement alike are registered in other terms. The prominence of major shaykhs, for instance, whom the tribesmen followed much as they did Imams, derived from wealth in the west and in Lower Yemen, and this is also where the great non-quantum shifts in territorial control resulted from tribesmen fighting each other. Inequality, power, and geographical change all attach, not to tribal self-definition, but to the history of successive Imams, to the history of a tradition or of a dynasty; and the dynasty had, by this point, collapsed because it had lost control of non-tribal land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_167_YeQasmi] 'The Imams' attempts to regain the south met with little success. Ahmad Salih Thawabah of Dhu Muhammad, who had controlled a large&nbsp;;wa~he of Lower Yemen, was defeated by al-Mutawakkil Muhammad and finally executed in 1848, to the delight of the Imam's supporters (Dresch 1987b). Within three years, however, his sons were formally granted land in much the same area (al-Hibshi 1980: 166). In the interim the Imam had been forced to send Dhii Muhammad horses as slaughter-beasts ('aqa'ir), which they took but did not have killed, and then pay them to fight again in the south (ibid. 146).20 Dhu Muhammad, Dhii Husayn, Arhab, Khawlan, and Hashid were also all fighting in the west, on the Imam's side, the Sharif's, or both; but the Ottoman Turks now seized the Tihamah. Hufash, near al-Mahwit, and al-Haymah were both contested, and several rival claimants to the Imamate appeared at once.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_168_YeQasmi] This enabled the eventual Ottoman re-conquest: 'In despair al-Mutawakkil asked the Turks to intervene in the highlands. They arrived at San'a' in 1849 with 1,200 foot and 500 horse, but a riot ensued and they withdrew after only three weeks (Zabarah 1929: ii, 346 ff.; al-Sayaghi 1978: 25-7). AlMutawakkil was killed by his rivals. One of the Ashraf of the northern Tihamah, supported by 'a large following from Hashid, was then bought off with a gift of 2,000 riyals, robes of honour, and a horse (al-Sayaghi 1978: 31). The combination of a Tihamah Sharif and Hashid at the gates of San'a' is symptomatic enough of the Imamate's weakness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_169_YeQasmi] 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO). They were to remain in highland Yemen until 19 18.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_170_YeQasmi] 'For much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, then, Yemen had been plagued by disputes between rival Imams and by tribal disorder. The Imamate had taken the form of an elaborate dynastic state, yet failed to secure the means to support itself or to transmit authority without dispute. Al-Shamahi credits the Qasimi dawlah with surviving until the middle of the nineteenth century. In name it did. He rationalizes the great decline of its power by saying that al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad (d. 1686) was the last of the Qasimis to possess all the qualities needed of an Imam, and that the rulers after him were more like kings (al-Shamahi 1972: 144-6). Similarly, al-Wazir (1971: 50) attributes the collapse of the state to the appearance of 'evil Imams'. Authors writing nearer the time each choose some point at which the real decline starts, always simply by reference to the actions or fate of a particular Imam (e.g. al-Hibshi 1980: 193).'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_172_YeQasmi] 'Al-Qasim b. Muhammad claimed the Imamate in 1597 and fought the Turks for slightly more than two decades.' When he died in 1620, his son al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad took the Imamate and renewed the war, but it was not until 1636 that the Turks were all driven out and the Zaydis came to hold all Yemen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_173_YeQasmi] 'The armies which expelled the Turks were drawn largely from the northern tribes, and the tribesmen spread with the conquest. This was not the first time they had come west and south (nor was it to be the last), but the Qasimi expansion was certainly a major episode of this kind, and many families of northern descent who are shaykhs (often considerable landowners) in Lower Yemen or the western mountains trace their migration to approximately this period (Messick 1978: 50; Tutwiler 1987). Shaykhs who remained in the north also gained control of land beyond their own territory. Elsewhere in the country there emerged what were almost distinct traditions, some of them highly unorthodox.f But the tribal shaykhs and successive Imams, whether in alliance or competition, always regained control and reserved the great struggles of the time to themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_174_YeQasmi] They established the Qasimi dynasty, but continued to rely on tribal support: 'Under al-Qasim, in the early seventeenth century, areas had been apportioned to the control of sayyids, but the leadership of armies had often devolved on shaykhs; and shaykhs had, for example, controlled strategic western forts well outside their own territory (see· e.g. Nubdhah: 106, 121, IF, 172). Some of them may have been associated with such areas for as much a century already, much as shaykhs had held western forts in Rasulid times.:' But they now held them for the Imam and were under his eye. They were becoming part of a larger and more prosperous political whole.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_175_YeQasmi] 'At times of truce, al-Qasim had acted against some of the tribes' own practices: for example, he put a stop to pilgrimages and sacrifices at a tree near Wadi Mawr and flogged men from alAhnurn for drinking (ibid. 338); his appointee even wheedled out of the tribes their 'books of tiighiit' and duly burned them (ibid. 435). Under al-Qasirn's successors, however, the tribes were treated carefully. Al-Mu'ayyad (1620-44), for example, seems not to have pressed the point of Islamic inheritance law and to have left the taxation of Barat in the hands of Bayt al-'Ansi, while his successor, al-Mutawakkil (1644-76), paid the tribes of Barat to support his campaign against Hadramawt (Serjeant 1983: 79-82). Aden and Lahj, which had already seceded, were retaken; a decade later alBaYQa' and Yafi' were subdued; Hadramawt was invaded; and the Zaydi arms were carried at one point to the borders of Dhufar in what is now Oman. The Qasimis also became involved in, though they did not conquer, areas north of Najran and 'Asir: 'the conquests spread with the support of the Hamdan tribes and the leadership of the Qasimi family' (al-Sharnahi 1972: 145), and alMutawakkil moved his capital from Shaharah to Dawran, south of San'a'. The state (now called a dawlah by its own chroniclers) had to link the north, where armed force still lay, to the richer tax base of Lower Yemen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_176_YeQasmi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Internal wars ♣ present ♥</b> Political and military authority was loose and fluid, with imams and their retainers co-existing and occasionally competing with shaykhs leading groups of armed tribesmen. Dresch describes the emergence of the Qasimid court, including the establishment of a retainer army: 'Besides the wealth to be extracted from the southern peasantry, the Imams of the period also had available, if they could retain control, taxes from a burgeoning coffee trade. The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_177_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_178_YeQasmi] Leading shaykhly families rose to prominence in this period, partly due to the military support they had provided to the Qasimids in their anti-Ottoman campaigns: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_179_YeQasmi] The relationship between imams and tribal leaders could be supportive as well as hostile, in both political and military terms: 'Sali1}. Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670). Then, after a disastrous attempt on Yafi' (in what is nowadays South Yemen), which resulted in Ibb being lost to the tribes of the eastern desert, al-Mawahib called to account the northern tribes who had failed him. In 1702 he sent his nephew to deal with 'Hamdan and their chief Ibn Hubaysh', but a truce was made instead (ibid. 428; Zabarah 1941: 297). Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_180_YeQasmi] 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_181_YeQasmi] Conflict between rival imams also occurred and tribal military support could be decisive for the outcome: 'A few years later, in 1713, al-Husayn b. al-Qasim declared himself Imam in opposition to al-Mawahib, and 'Ali Hadi Hubaysh (probably Sali1}.'s brother) supported him (Zabarah 1941: 601-9). 'Ali al-Ahmar of al-Usayrnat was sent by al-Mawahib to oppose him (again, this is the first mention of the family by name), but the tribes preferred the new claimant (ibid. 356,607). The country was at one point divided among several of these rival Imams-although, significantly, none of them claimed control of the major tribes (ibid. 616)-and the struggle between.the different Qasimis dragged on, with the shaykhs holding the balance, until al-Mawahib died in 1718.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_182_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ... (al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_183_YeQasmi] 'As Stookey points out, al-Husayn's combination with the tribes against his father availed him little since when his father died, in the following year, and he claimed the Imamate himself under the title al-Mansiir, they supported his cousin, al-Nasir Muhammad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_184_YeQasmi] 'But al-jirafi goes on, more importantly, to relate that al-Ahmar wrote al-Mansur al-Husayn a brusque letter demanding a meeting. The Imam feared an attempt at assassination; so he'assassinated alAhmar first, stuck his head on a lance, and galloped off with it through a hail of bullets from the shaykh's enraged tribesmen (aljirafi 1951: 182). In fact, al-Ahrnar, accompanied by Bin juzaylan of DhU Muhammad and by Ahmad Muhammad Hubaysh of Sufyan, seems to have come to 'Asir, just outside San'a', to seek a settlement (Zabarah 1941: 539 and 1958: 486). The details are probably lost forever, and we are told only that al-Ahmar 'had wished to make independent his own rule of part of the country' (ibid.), which he very well may have done; but al-Mansur alHusayn's view of the matter, as recorded in the histories, has all the vigorous clarity of the Zaydi tradition. The taunt to the tribesmen at the time was, typically, that they were no better than polytheists: he brandished al-Ahmar's head on his spear and cried 'this is the head of your idol'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_185_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions millenarian militant movements: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam. Accounts of the rising mention several forts in the west being taken from Bayt al-Ahmar: al-Qahirah at alMahabishah was lost, then Qaradah and al-Gharnuq at Najrah, just south of Hajjah, then Sabrah, and finally the fort near alMadayir that al-Mansur had bought several years earlier (Zabarah 1941: 53-5). During the forty years since al-Mansur al-Husayn b. al-Qasim (a rival of al-Mawahib) came to power in 1712, says a contemporary witness, the state had counted for little: "The rule of 'All al-Ahmar and his sons after him and of other tribesmen from Hashid remained over-great and excessive until God destroyed what they had built and extinguished their flame, proclaiming their weakness and perdition by the appearance of this dervish. (Quoted ibid. 54)' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_186_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders held lands, collected taxes, and defended forts, enabling them to form a power base in their own right: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_187_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_188_YeQasmi] However, written records are often silent on these matters: 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_189_YeQasmi] In addition, sayyids also quarreled amongst themselves: 'AI-Mahdi al-iAbbas (1748-75) was very much a Sanani Imam, being based on the city throughout his reign. Among learned San'anis he retained a high reputation (al-Shawkani 19 29: 310-12; Serjeant 1983: 85 ff.), but it is plain that all was not well elsewhere. Abu 'Alamah's 175I rising in the north-west has already been mentioned. Two years earlier a campaign had been fought in Lower Yemen against a 'sorcerer' who promised his followers immunity against sword wounds and gun shots.V In the year before that, Hasan al-Tlkarn, of the qadi family from Barat and the north-east, was leading tribesmen at odds with the new Imam in Lower Yemen (Zabarah 1958: 684)Y In both the west and the south, the incursion of tribesmen over the preceding generation had not been quietly absorbed, and the affairs of the Barat tribes in particular (Dhii Muhammad and Dhu Husayn) became involved with those of the Imam's capital at San'a'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_190_YeQasmi] 'The connections of learning which were often important in an Imam's rise to power (Ch. 5) could also readily generalize a threat to that power if one emerged; and the language of equality, justice, and religious probity linked the learned with the tribesmen also. In 17 68, for instance, the 'ulamd' of Barat (particularly Bayt al-'Ansi) wrote to Zaydi centres such as Huth and Dhamar, calling for the expulsion of al-Mahdi al-Abbas and his Qasimi relatives on doctrinal grounds (al-jirafi 1951: 187; Zabarah 1958: 521-2; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 134-5), though the Barat tribes' incursions in preceding years suggest that doctrinal detail was not the main motive force (see e.g. Zabarah 1958: 13).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_191_YeQasmi] 'The Qasimis were accused of 'innovations' (bida'). Zaydism had always recognized ijtihad (the formation of new law by extrapolation from scripture), but in the mid-eighteenth century a pronounced movement of criticism was under way. Ibn al-Amir, for instance, a Zaydi scholar who kept his political distance from the Imamate, blurred the distinction between his own school and the Shafi'i,14 with the result that conspicuous details, such as postures of prayer, became matters of contention among those less learned than he. The Barat qadis blamed the Qasimis for supporting him. On at least one occasion, an intestine squabble among San'ani 'ulamd' over mosque appointments, phrased in these terms, led one faction to demand arbitration from al-'Ansi, 'the qadi of Hashid and Bakil' (Zabarah 1941: 617), rather than from their Qasimi rulers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_192_YeQasmi] Imams were often reduced to negotiate protection money with tribes under the threat of military incursions: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_193_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mansiir 'All b. al-Mahdi (1775-1809) was, like his father, a San'ani Imam, and from the city's point of view was at first a considerable success (Serjeant 1983: 86-7; al-Shawkani 1929: i. 359 ff.). But at the state's periphery, Sharif Harniid of Abu Arish was forced south by the Nejd Wahhabis into territory the Imamate had held or at least had part access to. The resulting loss of port revenue was almost certainly serious. I? From now on, the Imams' ability to buy off the tribes declined sharply.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_194_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_195_YeQasmi] This lead to a gradual break-down of imamic authority: 'In 1823 a severe drought in the east forced a meeting of tribes at Jabal Barat, where they decided to seek aid from the Imam. When he refused and they turned on Lower Yemen, he seems to have been able to do nothing but warn others they were coming. 'When they reached Sarnarah [the pass that is sometimes taken to define Lower Yemen's border; see Chapter I], each put down his pledge on a place, and they divided it all up as if their father had left them the land as inheritance' (al-Hibshi 1980: 34). It is quite possible, of course, that many had indeed been left inheritance there, either property or presumed rights to 'fiefs' (quta'): they had been involved with the area for the best part of a century. From 1823 onwards, though, they are said to have held the area unopposed: 'they took control of it by force and coercion, then settled there, married there, and forgot the east until the Faqih Sa'Id threw them out in [1840]' (ibid.i.l" Even that was not sufficient, and when a further drought struck in 1835, Dhii Husayn, under Muhsin 'Ali alShayif, began raiding the north-west, while their women and children moved westwards by themselves in great numbers (ibid. 60-2). The Tiharnah had meanwhile fallen to the Egyptians.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_196_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, in San'a', the Imamate under al-Mansiir 'All b. alMahdi 'Abdullah lost not only its resources but its ~oral vigour: 'drunkenness was the prevailing vice among the higher orders, and ... the corpses of men, women and children lay about the streets, no one taking the trouble to bury them .. .' (Playfair 1859: 145)· Al-Mansiir squabbled with one of his relatives, who fled to Ta'izz and handed it over to the Egyptians. Al-Nasir 'Abdullah Ahsan was then raised to the Imamate by the soldiers in San'a', only to be assassinated at Wadi Dahr in 1840.19 Al-Hadi Muhammad took the throne and succeeded briefly in regaining Mocha and Ta'izz, but when the Egyptians withdrew-under indirect pressure from Britain (Baldry 1976: I6I)-the Tiharnah fell under the control of Sharif Husayn.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_197_YeQasmi] 'The geographical pattern of power had now changed beyond recognition. Hashid (led in part by the qadis of Bayt Hanash), were in Raymah, as well as further north in the western mountains, Dhii Muhammad and Dhii Husayn were in the south, as well as in the Tihamah, and all were involved with Yam, whose homeland in Najran had usually been outside the field of Yemeni events but whose presence in Haraz and the Tiharnah was nothing new. The land of Hashid and Bakil, on the northern plateau, was itself a dead centre to the whirl of events involving tribesmen elsewhere. Sharif Husayn's movements in 1845 make the point: starting from the north-west, in the Tihamah, he moved to the south, around Ta'izz, then to Barat, in the extreme north-east (al-Hibshi 1980: 120-31). The Imamate, at San'a', retained a mere rump of territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_198_YeQasmi] 'There was -violence enough in the north itself, particularly in times of drought (see e.g. ibid. 306); but the tribal divisions, one should note, changed very little, and then rather in a longue duree than in the order of events recorded year by year. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the geographical detail even of sections within tribes changes hardly at all from al-Qasim's time (early seventeenth century) to our own, and where change occurs it does so by recognizable quanta. Inequality and movement alike are registered in other terms. The prominence of major shaykhs, for instance, whom the tribesmen followed much as they did Imams, derived from wealth in the west and in Lower Yemen, and this is also where the great non-quantum shifts in territorial control resulted from tribesmen fighting each other. Inequality, power, and geographical change all attach, not to tribal self-definition, but to the history of successive Imams, to the history of a tradition or of a dynasty; and the dynasty had, by this point, collapsed because it had lost control of non-tribal land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_199_YeQasmi] 'The Imams' attempts to regain the south met with little success. Ahmad Salih Thawabah of Dhu Muhammad, who had controlled a large&nbsp;;wa~he of Lower Yemen, was defeated by al-Mutawakkil Muhammad and finally executed in 1848, to the delight of the Imam's supporters (Dresch 1987b). Within three years, however, his sons were formally granted land in much the same area (al-Hibshi 1980: 166). In the interim the Imam had been forced to send Dhii Muhammad horses as slaughter-beasts ('aqa'ir), which they took but did not have killed, and then pay them to fight again in the south (ibid. 146).20 Dhu Muhammad, Dhii Husayn, Arhab, Khawlan, and Hashid were also all fighting in the west, on the Imam's side, the Sharif's, or both; but the Ottoman Turks now seized the Tihamah. Hufash, near al-Mahwit, and al-Haymah were both contested, and several rival claimants to the Imamate appeared at once.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_200_YeQasmi] This enabled the eventual Ottoman re-conquest: 'In despair al-Mutawakkil asked the Turks to intervene in the highlands. They arrived at San'a' in 1849 with 1,200 foot and 500 horse, but a riot ensued and they withdrew after only three weeks (Zabarah 1929: ii, 346 ff.; al-Sayaghi 1978: 25-7). AlMutawakkil was killed by his rivals. One of the Ashraf of the northern Tihamah, supported by 'a large following from Hashid, was then bought off with a gift of 2,000 riyals, robes of honour, and a horse (al-Sayaghi 1978: 31). The combination of a Tihamah Sharif and Hashid at the gates of San'a' is symptomatic enough of the Imamate's weakness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_201_YeQasmi] 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO). They were to remain in highland Yemen until 19 18.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_202_YeQasmi] 'For much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, then, Yemen had been plagued by disputes between rival Imams and by tribal disorder. The Imamate had taken the form of an elaborate dynastic state, yet failed to secure the means to support itself or to transmit authority without dispute. Al-Shamahi credits the Qasimi dawlah with surviving until the middle of the nineteenth century. In name it did. He rationalizes the great decline of its power by saying that al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad (d. 1686) was the last of the Qasimis to possess all the qualities needed of an Imam, and that the rulers after him were more like kings (al-Shamahi 1972: 144-6). Similarly, al-Wazir (1971: 50) attributes the collapse of the state to the appearance of 'evil Imams'. Authors writing nearer the time each choose some point at which the real decline starts, always simply by reference to the actions or fate of a particular Imam (e.g. al-Hibshi 1980: 193).'

Dresch describes the emergence of the Qasimid court, including the establishment of a retainer army: 'Besides the wealth to be extracted from the southern peasantry, the Imams of the period also had available, if they could retain control, taxes from a burgeoning coffee trade. The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_204_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_205_YeQasmi] Leading shaykhly families rose to prominence in this period, partly due to the military support they had provided to the Qasimids in their anti-Ottoman campaigns: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_206_YeQasmi] The relationship between imams and tribal leaders could be supportive as well as hostile, in both political and military terms: 'Sali1}. Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670). Then, after a disastrous attempt on Yafi' (in what is nowadays South Yemen), which resulted in Ibb being lost to the tribes of the eastern desert, al-Mawahib called to account the northern tribes who had failed him. In 1702 he sent his nephew to deal with 'Hamdan and their chief Ibn Hubaysh', but a truce was made instead (ibid. 428; Zabarah 1941: 297). Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_207_YeQasmi] 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_208_YeQasmi] Conflict between rival imams also occurred and tribal military support could be decisive for the outcome: 'A few years later, in 1713, al-Husayn b. al-Qasim declared himself Imam in opposition to al-Mawahib, and 'Ali Hadi Hubaysh (probably Sali1}.'s brother) supported him (Zabarah 1941: 601-9). 'Ali al-Ahmar of al-Usayrnat was sent by al-Mawahib to oppose him (again, this is the first mention of the family by name), but the tribes preferred the new claimant (ibid. 356,607). The country was at one point divided among several of these rival Imams-although, significantly, none of them claimed control of the major tribes (ibid. 616)-and the struggle between.the different Qasimis dragged on, with the shaykhs holding the balance, until al-Mawahib died in 1718.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ... (al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_210_YeQasmi] 'As Stookey points out, al-Husayn's combination with the tribes against his father availed him little since when his father died, in the following year, and he claimed the Imamate himself under the title al-Mansiir, they supported his cousin, al-Nasir Muhammad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_211_YeQasmi] 'But al-jirafi goes on, more importantly, to relate that al-Ahmar wrote al-Mansur al-Husayn a brusque letter demanding a meeting. The Imam feared an attempt at assassination; so he'assassinated alAhmar first, stuck his head on a lance, and galloped off with it through a hail of bullets from the shaykh's enraged tribesmen (aljirafi 1951: 182). In fact, al-Ahrnar, accompanied by Bin juzaylan of DhU Muhammad and by Ahmad Muhammad Hubaysh of Sufyan, seems to have come to 'Asir, just outside San'a', to seek a settlement (Zabarah 1941: 539 and 1958: 486). The details are probably lost forever, and we are told only that al-Ahmar 'had wished to make independent his own rule of part of the country' (ibid.), which he very well may have done; but al-Mansur alHusayn's view of the matter, as recorded in the histories, has all the vigorous clarity of the Zaydi tradition. The taunt to the tribesmen at the time was, typically, that they were no better than polytheists: he brandished al-Ahmar's head on his spear and cried 'this is the head of your idol'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_212_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions millenarian militant movements: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam. Accounts of the rising mention several forts in the west being taken from Bayt al-Ahmar: al-Qahirah at alMahabishah was lost, then Qaradah and al-Gharnuq at Najrah, just south of Hajjah, then Sabrah, and finally the fort near alMadayir that al-Mansur had bought several years earlier (Zabarah 1941: 53-5). During the forty years since al-Mansur al-Husayn b. al-Qasim (a rival of al-Mawahib) came to power in 1712, says a contemporary witness, the state had counted for little: "The rule of 'All al-Ahmar and his sons after him and of other tribesmen from Hashid remained over-great and excessive until God destroyed what they had built and extinguished their flame, proclaiming their weakness and perdition by the appearance of this dervish. (Quoted ibid. 54)' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_213_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders held lands, collected taxes, and defended forts, enabling them to form a power base in their own right: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_214_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_215_YeQasmi] However, written records are often silent on these matters: 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_216_YeQasmi] In addition, sayyids also quarreled amongst themselves: 'AI-Mahdi al-iAbbas (1748-75) was very much a Sanani Imam, being based on the city throughout his reign. Among learned San'anis he retained a high reputation (al-Shawkani 19 29: 310-12; Serjeant 1983: 85 ff.), but it is plain that all was not well elsewhere. Abu 'Alamah's 175I rising in the north-west has already been mentioned. Two years earlier a campaign had been fought in Lower Yemen against a 'sorcerer' who promised his followers immunity against sword wounds and gun shots.V In the year before that, Hasan al-Tlkarn, of the qadi family from Barat and the north-east, was leading tribesmen at odds with the new Imam in Lower Yemen (Zabarah 1958: 684)Y In both the west and the south, the incursion of tribesmen over the preceding generation had not been quietly absorbed, and the affairs of the Barat tribes in particular (Dhii Muhammad and Dhu Husayn) became involved with those of the Imam's capital at San'a'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_217_YeQasmi] 'The connections of learning which were often important in an Imam's rise to power (Ch. 5) could also readily generalize a threat to that power if one emerged; and the language of equality, justice, and religious probity linked the learned with the tribesmen also. In 17 68, for instance, the 'ulamd' of Barat (particularly Bayt al-'Ansi) wrote to Zaydi centres such as Huth and Dhamar, calling for the expulsion of al-Mahdi al-Abbas and his Qasimi relatives on doctrinal grounds (al-jirafi 1951: 187; Zabarah 1958: 521-2; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 134-5), though the Barat tribes' incursions in preceding years suggest that doctrinal detail was not the main motive force (see e.g. Zabarah 1958: 13).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_218_YeQasmi] 'The Qasimis were accused of 'innovations' (bida'). Zaydism had always recognized ijtihad (the formation of new law by extrapolation from scripture), but in the mid-eighteenth century a pronounced movement of criticism was under way. Ibn al-Amir, for instance, a Zaydi scholar who kept his political distance from the Imamate, blurred the distinction between his own school and the Shafi'i,14 with the result that conspicuous details, such as postures of prayer, became matters of contention among those less learned than he. The Barat qadis blamed the Qasimis for supporting him. On at least one occasion, an intestine squabble among San'ani 'ulamd' over mosque appointments, phrased in these terms, led one faction to demand arbitration from al-'Ansi, 'the qadi of Hashid and Bakil' (Zabarah 1941: 617), rather than from their Qasimi rulers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_219_YeQasmi] Imams were often reduced to negotiate protection money with tribes under the threat of military incursions: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_220_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mansiir 'All b. al-Mahdi (1775-1809) was, like his father, a San'ani Imam, and from the city's point of view was at first a considerable success (Serjeant 1983: 86-7; al-Shawkani 1929: i. 359 ff.). But at the state's periphery, Sharif Harniid of Abu Arish was forced south by the Nejd Wahhabis into territory the Imamate had held or at least had part access to. The resulting loss of port revenue was almost certainly serious. I? From now on, the Imams' ability to buy off the tribes declined sharply.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_221_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_222_YeQasmi] This lead to a gradual break-down of imamic authority: 'In 1823 a severe drought in the east forced a meeting of tribes at Jabal Barat, where they decided to seek aid from the Imam. When he refused and they turned on Lower Yemen, he seems to have been able to do nothing but warn others they were coming. 'When they reached Sarnarah [the pass that is sometimes taken to define Lower Yemen's border; see Chapter I], each put down his pledge on a place, and they divided it all up as if their father had left them the land as inheritance' (al-Hibshi 1980: 34). It is quite possible, of course, that many had indeed been left inheritance there, either property or presumed rights to 'fiefs' (quta'): they had been involved with the area for the best part of a century. From 1823 onwards, though, they are said to have held the area unopposed: 'they took control of it by force and coercion, then settled there, married there, and forgot the east until the Faqih Sa'Id threw them out in [1840]' (ibid.i.l" Even that was not sufficient, and when a further drought struck in 1835, Dhii Husayn, under Muhsin 'Ali alShayif, began raiding the north-west, while their women and children moved westwards by themselves in great numbers (ibid. 60-2). The Tiharnah had meanwhile fallen to the Egyptians.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_223_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, in San'a', the Imamate under al-Mansiir 'All b. alMahdi 'Abdullah lost not only its resources but its ~oral vigour: 'drunkenness was the prevailing vice among the higher orders, and ... the corpses of men, women and children lay about the streets, no one taking the trouble to bury them .. .' (Playfair 1859: 145)· Al-Mansiir squabbled with one of his relatives, who fled to Ta'izz and handed it over to the Egyptians. Al-Nasir 'Abdullah Ahsan was then raised to the Imamate by the soldiers in San'a', only to be assassinated at Wadi Dahr in 1840.19 Al-Hadi Muhammad took the throne and succeeded briefly in regaining Mocha and Ta'izz, but when the Egyptians withdrew-under indirect pressure from Britain (Baldry 1976: I6I)-the Tiharnah fell under the control of Sharif Husayn.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_224_YeQasmi] 'The geographical pattern of power had now changed beyond recognition. Hashid (led in part by the qadis of Bayt Hanash), were in Raymah, as well as further north in the western mountains, Dhii Muhammad and Dhii Husayn were in the south, as well as in the Tihamah, and all were involved with Yam, whose homeland in Najran had usually been outside the field of Yemeni events but whose presence in Haraz and the Tiharnah was nothing new. The land of Hashid and Bakil, on the northern plateau, was itself a dead centre to the whirl of events involving tribesmen elsewhere. Sharif Husayn's movements in 1845 make the point: starting from the north-west, in the Tihamah, he moved to the south, around Ta'izz, then to Barat, in the extreme north-east (al-Hibshi 1980: 120-31). The Imamate, at San'a', retained a mere rump of territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_225_YeQasmi] 'There was -violence enough in the north itself, particularly in times of drought (see e.g. ibid. 306); but the tribal divisions, one should note, changed very little, and then rather in a longue duree than in the order of events recorded year by year. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the geographical detail even of sections within tribes changes hardly at all from al-Qasim's time (early seventeenth century) to our own, and where change occurs it does so by recognizable quanta. Inequality and movement alike are registered in other terms. The prominence of major shaykhs, for instance, whom the tribesmen followed much as they did Imams, derived from wealth in the west and in Lower Yemen, and this is also where the great non-quantum shifts in territorial control resulted from tribesmen fighting each other. Inequality, power, and geographical change all attach, not to tribal self-definition, but to the history of successive Imams, to the history of a tradition or of a dynasty; and the dynasty had, by this point, collapsed because it had lost control of non-tribal land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_226_YeQasmi] 'The Imams' attempts to regain the south met with little success. Ahmad Salih Thawabah of Dhu Muhammad, who had controlled a large&nbsp;;wa~he of Lower Yemen, was defeated by al-Mutawakkil Muhammad and finally executed in 1848, to the delight of the Imam's supporters (Dresch 1987b). Within three years, however, his sons were formally granted land in much the same area (al-Hibshi 1980: 166). In the interim the Imam had been forced to send Dhii Muhammad horses as slaughter-beasts ('aqa'ir), which they took but did not have killed, and then pay them to fight again in the south (ibid. 146).20 Dhu Muhammad, Dhii Husayn, Arhab, Khawlan, and Hashid were also all fighting in the west, on the Imam's side, the Sharif's, or both; but the Ottoman Turks now seized the Tihamah. Hufash, near al-Mahwit, and al-Haymah were both contested, and several rival claimants to the Imamate appeared at once.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_227_YeQasmi] This enabled the eventual Ottoman re-conquest: 'In despair al-Mutawakkil asked the Turks to intervene in the highlands. They arrived at San'a' in 1849 with 1,200 foot and 500 horse, but a riot ensued and they withdrew after only three weeks (Zabarah 1929: ii, 346 ff.; al-Sayaghi 1978: 25-7). AlMutawakkil was killed by his rivals. One of the Ashraf of the northern Tihamah, supported by 'a large following from Hashid, was then bought off with a gift of 2,000 riyals, robes of honour, and a horse (al-Sayaghi 1978: 31). The combination of a Tihamah Sharif and Hashid at the gates of San'a' is symptomatic enough of the Imamate's weakness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_228_YeQasmi] 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO). They were to remain in highland Yemen until 19 18.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_229_YeQasmi] 'For much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, then, Yemen had been plagued by disputes between rival Imams and by tribal disorder. The Imamate had taken the form of an elaborate dynastic state, yet failed to secure the means to support itself or to transmit authority without dispute. Al-Shamahi credits the Qasimi dawlah with surviving until the middle of the nineteenth century. In name it did. He rationalizes the great decline of its power by saying that al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad (d. 1686) was the last of the Qasimis to possess all the qualities needed of an Imam, and that the rulers after him were more like kings (al-Shamahi 1972: 144-6). Similarly, al-Wazir (1971: 50) attributes the collapse of the state to the appearance of 'evil Imams'. Authors writing nearer the time each choose some point at which the real decline starts, always simply by reference to the actions or fate of a particular Imam (e.g. al-Hibshi 1980: 193).'

Egyption forces become involved in Yemen during that time period as well: 'In 1823 a severe drought in the east forced a meeting of tribes at Jabal Barat, where they decided to seek aid from the Imam. When he refused and they turned on Lower Yemen, he seems to have been able to do nothing but warn others they were coming.

It is quite possible, of course, that many had indeed been left inheritance there, either property or presumed rights to 'fiefs' (quta'): they had been involved with the area for the best part of a century. From 1823 onwards, though, they are said to have held the area unopposed: 'they took control of it by force and coercion, then settled there, married there, and forgot the east until the Faqih Sa'Id threw them out in [1840]' (ibid.i.l" Even that was not sufficient, and when a further drought struck in 1835, Dhii Husayn, under Muhsin 'Ali alShayif, began raiding the north-west, while their women and children moved westwards by themselves in great numbers (ibid. 60-2).

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions a millenarian uprising: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam.

Tobi provides a summary of the events: 'In 1629 power in San'a was retaken by the native populalion after the Turks were driven out by the sons of the Zaydi Imam al-Qasim, who had firsl risen in revolt against them at the end of the previous century. While the Jews did not live at ease under Turkish rule, especially in its last years, as attested by Shalom Shabazi in his commentary to the Pentateuch liemdat Yamim,7 their lot deteriorated under the Zaydi yoke. The latter were religious fanatics and far stricter than the Sunni Ottomans (of the Hanafi school) in their treatment of Jews as ahl aidhimmah. 8 But to the religious facet was added the national facet, for the new Zaydi rulers accused the Jews of siding with the infidel Turks.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_248_YeQasmi] 'Religious ardour apparently intensified in particular under al-Qasim's son, the Imam Ism3'il al-Mutawakkil, who took power in 1644 and who was zealously religious. 'o Despite all the foregoing, there is no evidence whatever in the Jewish sources that at a certain date prior to the events associated with Shabbetay Zevi in 1667 acts of repression were carried out against the Jews of Yemen. On the other hand, according to various sources the latter expected the coming of the Messiah in the course of the seventeenth century, from the year 1619 on. This was connected with the appearance of two comets that year, according to Yisrael HaKohen of Qubayrah, the city of the priests in the Shar'ab province in southern Yemen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_249_YeQasmi] 'In the years immediately following 1619 the Jews of Yemen encountered great distress in the form of apostasy and incarceration and tonure at the hands of the Turkish rulers, worsened by the starvation resuhing from this and from a plague of locusts. Among the casualties were Yosef ben Avigad, Shabazi's father, and members of his family, as he relates in the sequel to the account of the comets in 1619. These harsh events were perceived as the birth-pangs preceding the advent of the Messiah, as indicated by the writing of zakharyah Ha-Zidoni, who in 1626 (1937 of the SE) expected the arrival of the Messiah in 1940 of the SE ("'In the year 1940 You shall accomplish vengeance") (a pun in Hebrew on the number of the year and the word for vengeance). That year was 1629, the year in which the Turks were driven out of San'a by the sons of al-Qasim, the Imam who rebelled against the foreign yoke.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_250_YeQasmi] 'The first information on Shabbetay Zevi reached Yemen very late, in 1666,30 when the Sabbatean movement was at its height and close to the time of the apocalypse expected that year.31 But it is noteworthy that at that time the advent of the Messiah was expected not only on the basis of this information and the omen of the two comets of 1619, since which time eighty years had not yet passed (see above), but also on the basis of another comet that had appeared in 1665. The only intimation of this is in one of the manuscripts of Shabazi's ll.emdat Yamim, in which the following appendage is found after the above account of the 1619 comelS: "In the year 1976 of Lht: SE a star arose before it like a flame and described a circle until it returned behind it; perhaps this is the star of the Messiah."' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_251_YeQasmi] 'Following the impression made by these events, but without any connection to&nbsp;!.hem, one year later-I 666--letters reached Yemen from Safed and Egypt. apparently Alexandria, telling of the approach of the end of days and of the Messiah Shabbetay Zevi.J ) Some of the letters from Egypt reached the heads of the San'a community-Yihye Ha-Levi, who was head of the court of justice at San'a, and Siayman alNaqqash, the leader of the community. h is not stated explicitly that they were sent to them, and it seems that they were handed over to them by Yemeni Jews. Many of the Jews of Yemen had been led to believe in the messianism of Shabbetay Zevi and the prophecy of Nathan Ha' Azzati, who are the only two figures of the Sabbatean movement to whom reference is made in the letters of the Yemeni sages, even though the heads of the community, in San'a at least, rejected the rumours of redemption:'4 Like Jewish communities outside Yemen, the excitement caused by the tales of Shabbetay Zevi resulted in the occurrence of soothsaying among the Jews in San'a and the neighbouring communities, and also in the communities of the south_ The soothsayers (even including some women), called "heralds" in the sources,35 conducted propaganda on behalf of Shabbetay Zevi and encouraged the Jews to perfonn purification rites and mortification for the coming of the Messiah: it was forbidden to eat meat other than roasted, to drink wine even on Passover eve, to shave the hair of the women's heads, and to engage in sexual intercourse; food was to be dipped in dust and ashes and not in salt, etc. These customs were elaborated by the Sahbateans in Yemen of their own accord. although they had read about the act of purification and mortification in the letters promoting the movement that had reached Vemen from abroad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_252_YeQasmi] 'The Muslims in Yemen oppressed and humiliated the Jews, for which the author appeals to God thus: "Restore us against the tribula· tion and the torture and the humiliations that we have encountered in this exile" (p. 135). It seems that the oppression intensified after the Turks withdrew from Yemen in the 1630s. in particular under the rule of the zealous Imam al·Mut3wakkil Isma'il who ascended the throne in 1644: "Israel has borne several decrees and oppression and a large lax every month and all the days since the year DROR" (-541011650) (p.116). The straitened circumstances of the Yemeni ex.ile also become clear from the interpretation of the verse in Psalms 70:20: "In our exile we suffer from three calamities, the first is persecutions, wandering and slavery; the second is agony, poverty and humiliation; the third is war, abuse and famine" (p, 136), Moreover, from the author's vision of the future status of the Jews of Yemen following redemption something may be learned of their humiliation and resentment stemming from the special ta:&lt; they had to pay for protection by the Muslim ruler: "When the Messiah from the tribe of Ephrayim will appear [.,,] [in the year 5426 [1666J the [Arab] king [...] who was wandering in the desert [...] will distribule letters all over his kingdom 10 enhance the Jews [",] hoping to find reSI and peace and ease to his nation of the known nalion" (the Jews, p, 110), "The Lord will send a spirit in the tongue of every king and governor to announce in the markets and in the streets, saying: Peace. peace for Israel, they shall not pay any more mindah, bela and halakh06 (p. 138).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_253_YeQasmi] 'Elsewhere in the work it transpires that in fact during the rule of al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, cases of apostasy mulliplied under threat of persecution and by decree: these are the birth pangs of the Messiah and a hidden means of discovering if indeed there is complete repentance that will justify redemption (pp. 114-115).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_254_YeQasmi] 'We have observed above that the belief in Shabbetay Zevi in Yemen propagated mainly among the ordinary folk, while the leaders of the San'a community at least, the President Naqqash and the head of the rabbinical court Yihye Ha-Levi, were skeptical about i1.68 As we shall see below, these reservations on the part of these two, and apparently of other leaders in the San'a and other communities, are what saved them from the unnatural death that was the lot of Siayman Jamal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_255_YeQasmi] 'A contemporary Yemeni Muslim writer, 'Abd Allah ibn'Ali ibn al· Wazir, was the author of Iibtiq al-liulwti wa-Jihtif ai-Man wa·l-Salwa. Relating to the year 1077 of the Hijrah (beginning 4 July 1666), he sets out extremely important details on the messianic activity in Yemen that year.69 He states that it began in the month Rajab 1077 of the Hijrah, that is, January 1667. Presumably some time passed, at least several months, between the actual start of messianic activity in Yemen and the moment when the Muslims began to take note of it. The Muslim chronicle states, and this is borne out by what we know from the Hebrew sources, that the Jews sold their possessions cheaply and made preparations for their ascent to the Land of Israel, as the Messiah had been revealed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_256_YeQasmi] 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_257_YeQasmi] 'According to ibn al-Wazir, the stonn abated and the Imam took no funher steps against the Jews. But the Jews themselves, that is, those who held the messianic belief. exploited this time of calm and continued their messianic activity not only in secret but openly, There is no doubt that the official leaders of the San'a community did not participate, except for a certain group headed by one of its sages. The Muslim chronicler relates that in the course of a wine-drinking feast a member of this group became intoxicated and his companions dressed him in the finest garments. This may have been an indication of the messianic aspirations of that individual, as we shall see below. In any event, this man climbed up to the largest fortress of San'a, situated in the eastern outskirts of the city, and attempted to ascend to the throne and the canopy in the fortress, that is, to become ruler of the Muslims. He even made the outspoken demand that the Muslim commanders and soldiers in the fortress place themselves under his command. But instead the latter arrested the man and threw him into the Bustan prison in the city. The Imam was infonned of what had transpired. and he ordered the prisoner to be taken out and executed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_258_YeQasmi] 'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_259_YeQasmi] 'The leaders of the Jewish communities were arrested and tortured in several prisons, and the sentence of death hovered over lhem. As usual in cases of this kind in Yemen, Jews so sentenced were offered their lives in return for conversion to Islam;84 but the offer was rejected.1l.S Naqqash, the nagid of the San'a community, was exiled to Qamaran86 in the Red Sea, a mostly deserted island populated by a few fishermen and a handful of villagers who made their living by pearl diving87 and which was used as a prison island for political offenders.88 He remained imprisoned and shackled for two years and only lhen was he released and returned to San'a.89 During the Mawza' exile, in 1679, he was still officiating as the nagid of the San'a community.90 It appears that his release was due to the fact that like other leaders of the San'a and other communities he had not supported the messianic move-ment in Yemen at that time.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_260_YeQasmi] 'In contrast to this the fate of Jamal was far more bitter. When called before the governor of San'a, not the Imam Isma'il in Sfidah, during the Passover festival in 1667, he apparently did not deny his messianic belief. After arrest and torture "in a place beneath the ground,,91 he was handed over to "a second king in whose hand he used to place the tax", probably the'Amil of San' a, who was in charge of collecting the jizyah tax from the Jews and who therefore bore responsibility for them, and he too "locked him in a place of snakes and scorpions". They sent from San'a to the Imam asking him what to do with Jamal, since in the Zaydi ruling hierarchy the Imam was considered the supreme judge. The latter ordered that he be executed as a rebel against the kingdom who had grievously violated the protection agreement between the Zaydi state and the Jews, although in the history of Yemen Jewry only few cases are known of execution of Jews by the ruler.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_261_YeQasmi] 'Only then, apparently before the release of Naqqash from Qamaran island, were the leaders of the Jewish communities held in SCidah freed, "after suffering and large ransom", as Hamami writes on the New Moon of Second Adar in 1980 SE (1669), but without mention of the release of Naqqash. According to Hibshush,'OO the Jewish leaders remained in prison "a whole year, until the ministers of the land saved them, speaking reassuring and favourable words to the king".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_262_YeQasmi] 'Various natural disasters, especially a severe drought. that struck Yemen in the years following the execution of Jamal reinforced the opinion among Ihe Muslims in Yemen that the country was being punished for the act. For their part the Jews worked 10 spread and estab· Iish this view. II was also reported that a certain Jewish leader lOl vowed to take Muslim property to compensate for what the Imam Isma'il had confiscated from the Jews. It is related that he actually did so by means of witchcraft that destroyed Muslim propeny and harmed their villages and fields. 102 From a Hebrew source at our disposal, a lament by Shelo~ mo ben Ho!er al_'Uzayri,IOJ we learn that the reference is to the serious drought that occurred in 1669 throughout Yemen. This calamity struck the Jews in panicular, not only on account of the economic structure of the country, in which they were chiefly anisans remote from farming, but also owing to their poverty resulting from the heavy fines imposed on them and the expropriation of their property two years previously. The government, as was its wont, exploited these terrible circumstances, and did not supply the Jews with grain from its stores unless they convened. And indeed, as Hamami,l04 "about five hundred or more of Israel altered their faith, and it was as the generation of apostasy owing to the poverty that was from the start and owing to the famine that visited the earth", 'Uzayri points out not only the great famine but also the wandering of the Jews from place (0 place in search of food, and the decrees imposed on them by the "kingdom of evil" precisely at the time of their woe.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_263_YeQasmi] 'Some attenuation in the acts of repression against the Jews seems to have taken place towards the end of the life of the Imam Isma'il. In 1084 of the Hijrah (beginning 18 April 1673), he decided to release the propeny of the Jews that had been taken from them six years before. However. he imposed other taxes on the Jews in addition to the jizyah. 'OS The death of 15m3'11 and the ascent to power of his nephew alMahdi Ahmad ibn Hasan sparked the hope among the Jews of Yemen that an end to their suffering had come at last. An expression of this is three poems written by Shabazi in honour of this imam. '06 For our purpose of importance is the third poem, in which Shabazi says (translation from Arabic): "[...J In the rule of Ahmad I travelled peacefully and securely. My song is ended and my words are sealed with greetings of peace, may it embrace the seed of the Imam; there is nothing beyond them except the Messiah".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_YeQasmi] 'But the Jews of Yemen learned immediately that the cup of their suffering had not been filled by the execution, the imprisonment, the extra taxation, the fines, the confiscation of property and the discriminatory laws against them. The principal sources for this period are the Arabic chronicles and the legal opinions of the Muslim sages in Yemen regarding the settlement of the Jews in that country, as well as Shabazi's poems and Yihye Salin's Megillar Ternan. It emerges from Shabazi's poems107 that there was unremining pressure by the Zaydi government on the Jews to convert, and the Decree of the Orphans was renewed. lOB More important for the sUbject under review are the Arabic sources, because they reveal that the Imam Isma'il had already resolved to expel the Jews from Yemen, having concluded from the consequences of the messianic activity that their presence there was not beneficial for Islam and the Yemeni people. 109 The Qagi Shams ai-Islam Ahmad ibn ,Salin ibn abi al-Rijal writes in his opinion on the subject of the expulsion of the Jews thaI Isma'i1 commanded Ihis, and thaI in his own "holy scripl" he wrOle a will on his sickbed close 10 his death 1676, whose essence was Ihat the Jews of Yemen no longer enjoyed any protection by Ihe state and that it was obligatory to expel them from Yemen, Isma'il also willed thai no accounl be taken of any legal authorily, whoever he may be, who argued against the plain interpretation of Ihe hadirh allributed to Muhammad regarding the expulsion of the Jews from the Arabian Peninsula.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_265_YeQasmi] 'The Imam Isma'il therefore cited previous discussions on the settlement of the Jews in Yemen, and he wished to dismiss any interpretation that would permit their continued settlement. However, for various reasons, apparently economic in the main-the poverty of the country following the droughts-the heads of the Muslims from the family of the prophet Muhammad. the Sadah. succeeded in persuading Isma'il to act moderately, and at least (0 postpone the expulsion order for a certain period of time. Isma'il did not yield completely: although he gave up the idea of expulsion he requested the Muslim leaders who came to visit him during his illness to destroy the synagogues that had been built in Yemen; the intention was apparently those built after the rise of Islam; whose construction was forbidden in the terms of the protection.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_266_YeQasmi] 'Isma'il did not live to carry out what he desired, but his political testament was binding on his successor, Imam Ahmad. The latter, who like his predecessor was a great zaydi conqueror and expansionist, began to execute the will. On 28 September 1677 an order was sent by the Imam to the man who was eventually to inherit the crown of the imamate, Isma'il's son "Izz aI-Islam Muhammad,ll" on the expulsion of the Jews and the destruction of their synagogues. After giving the order he undertook discussions with the sages of Islam in San'a so as to win their support for the expulsion, which he then ascertained was a matter for controversy among the sages. On the other hand, all were agreed regarding the demolition of the synagogues. So that same year, 1677, the synagogue in San'a was locked up and those in the ai-Sawn area, northwest of San'a, were destroyed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_267_YeQasmi] 'Recently additional evidence has been published on the destruction of the synagogues in Yemen in those years, and this seems to indicate that these acts were restricted to the winter of 1678: "The razing of the synagogue of SUsan on the fourth day of the week which is third day of the year 1989 [SE-1678], and the enemie,s forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_268_YeQasmi] 'The consultations on the expulsion of the Jews were prolonged, the basic question being, as stated, if the prophet Muhammad had commanded the expulsion of the Jews from the entire Arabian Peninsula or from the Hijaz alone. liB Finally the Imam Ahmad resolved to implement the expulsion as a matter subject to the discretion of the ruler. as was the opinion of the Qadi ibn abi al_Rijal. l19 The 1ewish sources relate that the Jews were given the chance of converting to Islam in order to forestall the expulsion decree, an offer that they spumed, and that at first the intention was to deport them to the coast of Africa, beyond the Yemen borders. but through the intervention of Muslims close to the government the Imam Ahmad agreed to their expulsion to the Mawza' region in western Yemen near the pon of Mocha. And indeed, in 1679, about three years after Ahmad's succession, the Jews were expelled from all pans of Yemen to Mawza' _ Again, through the agency of the factors mentioned above, on account of the need for Jews in the country's economy as artisans and small traders, they were allowed to return from exile, albeit not to the same quarters and houses, but to new abodes near the cities yet outside the walls; the situation was similar regarding villages. l20 The construction of synagogues was no longer penniued and worship was conducted in private homes converted into prayer houses. In October 1679, after the Jews began their journey into exile, the Imam Ahmad ordered the doors of the San'a synagogue. which had been locked in 1676, to be opened; he took away the books and poured oul the wine kept in its storerooms. On the advice of ',Izz alIslam Muhammad ben Isma'i1 the synagogue was tom down, and in its stead a mosque was built, and given the name masjid al-jala' ("the mosque of the exile").'

Ahmad Salih Thawabah of Dhu Muhammad, who had controlled a large&nbsp;;wa~he of Lower Yemen, was defeated by al-Mutawakkil Muhammad and finally executed in 1848, to the delight of the Imam's supporters (Dresch 1987b). Within three years, however, his sons were formally granted land in much the same area (al-Hibshi 1980: 166). In the interim the Imam had been forced to send Dhii Muhammad horses as slaughter-beasts ('aqa'ir), which they took but did not have killed, and then pay them to fight again in the south (ibid. 146).20 Dhu Muhammad, Dhii Husayn, Arhab, Khawlan, and Hashid were also all fighting in the west, on the Imam's side, the Sharif's, or both; but the Ottoman Turks now seized the Tihamah. Hufash, near al-Mahwit, and al-Haymah were both contested, and several rival claimants to the Imamate appeared at once.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_270_YeQasmi] 'In despair al-Mutawakkil asked the Turks to intervene in the highlands. They arrived at San'a' in 1849 with 1,200 foot and 500 horse, but a riot ensued and they withdrew after only three weeks (Zabarah 1929: ii, 346 ff.; al-Sayaghi 1978: 25-7). AlMutawakkil was killed by his rivals. One of the Ashraf of the northern Tihamah, supported by 'a large following from Hashid, was then bought off with a gift of 2,000 riyals, robes of honour, and a horse (al-Sayaghi 1978: 31). The combination of a Tihamah Sharif and Hashid at the gates of San'a' is symptomatic enough of the Imamate's weakness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_271_YeQasmi] 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO). They were to remain in highland Yemen until 19 18.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_272_YeQasmi] But it appears that this process started after the end of this data sheet. Accordingly, this is covered in the Ottoman-period data sheet. We are unsure whether victories of imamic forces over tribesmen count as 'annexation'. This is in need of clarification.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Looting ♣ present ♥</b> Descriptions of conflicts involving armed tribesmen seem to indicate sack and looting: 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_273_YeQasmi] 'Ali al-Ahrnar is mentioned by name in connection with events in 1713, trading his support between rival Imams. His tombstone, and the local tradition that no doubt incorporates what is writtenthere, gives al-Ahmar the .further name of al-Gharibi, and Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi, as we have seen, is mentioned as a great shaykh based near Hiith in 1709. Before that we know nothing of the family or of what they were called? But after al-Mansiir al-Husayn declared himself Imam, in 1727, he bought a strategic fort near alAhnum from Qasim al-Ahmar for one thousand riyals and razed it (Zabarah 1941: 55). When al-Mansiir was succeeded by al-Mahdi in 1748, al-Ahmar went down to Habur, took the area and rebuilt the fort. In the interim, in 1729-30, the Najran tribe of Yam had attacked the Tihamah and the west, after Hashid had opened the route to them through Dhibin, Bayt al-Ahmar are mentioned specifically as taking (and very probably retaking) areas of Hufash and Milhan, and then sending part of the spoil to the Imam as if to legitimate their position (Zabarah 1958: 890-2). No details are given of how extensive their possessions were.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_274_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_275_YeQasmi] Jewish property was looted in response to the emergence of Messianic movements in Yemen: 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_276_YeQasmi] 'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).'

'06 For our purpose of importance is the third poem, in which Shabazi says (translation from Arabic): "[...J In the rule of Ahmad I travelled peacefully and securely. My song is ended and my words are sealed with greetings of peace, may it embrace the seed of the Imam; there is nothing beyond them except the Messiah".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_287_YeQasmi] Synagogues were destroyed as well: 'Isma'il did not live to carry out what he desired, but his political testament was binding on his successor, Imam Ahmad. The latter, who like his predecessor was a great zaydi conqueror and expansionist, began to execute the will. On 28 September 1677 an order was sent by the Imam to the man who was eventually to inherit the crown of the imamate, Isma'il's son "Izz aI-Islam Muhammad,ll" on the expulsion of the Jews and the destruction of their synagogues. After giving the order he undertook discussions with the sages of Islam in San'a so as to win their support for the expulsion, which he then ascertained was a matter for controversy among the sages. On the other hand, all were agreed regarding the demolition of the synagogues.

The latter ordered that he be executed as a rebel against the kingdom who had grievously violated the protection agreement between the Zaydi state and the Jews, although in the history of Yemen Jewry only few cases are known of execution of Jews by the ruler.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_311_YeQasmi] 'Only then, apparently before the release of Naqqash from Qamaran island, were the leaders of the Jewish communities held in SCidah freed, "after suffering and large ransom", as Hamami writes on the New Moon of Second Adar in 1980 SE (1669), but without mention of the release of Naqqash. According to Hibshush,'OO the Jewish leaders remained in prison "a whole year, until the ministers of the land saved them, speaking reassuring and favourable words to the king".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_312_YeQasmi] 'But the Jews of Yemen learned immediately that the cup of their suffering had not been filled by the execution, the imprisonment, the extra taxation, the fines, the confiscation of property and the discriminatory laws against them. The principal sources for this period are the Arabic chronicles and the legal opinions of the Muslim sages in Yemen regarding the settlement of the Jews in that country, as well as Shabazi's poems and Yihye Salin's Megillar Ternan. It emerges from Shabazi's poems107 that there was unremining pressure by the Zaydi government on the Jews to convert, and the Decree of the Orphans was renewed. lOB More important for the sUbject under review are the Arabic sources, because they reveal that the Imam Isma'il had already resolved to expel the Jews from Yemen, having concluded from the consequences of the messianic activity that their presence there was not beneficial for Islam and the Yemeni people. 109 The Qagi Shams ai-Islam Ahmad ibn ,Salin ibn abi al-Rijal writes in his opinion on the subject of the expulsion of the Jews thaI Isma'i1 commanded Ihis, and thaI in his own "holy scripl" he wrOle a will on his sickbed close 10 his death 1676, whose essence was Ihat the Jews of Yemen no longer enjoyed any protection by Ihe state and that it was obligatory to expel them from Yemen, Isma'il also willed thai no accounl be taken of any legal authorily, whoever he may be, who argued against the plain interpretation of Ihe hadirh allributed to Muhammad regarding the expulsion of the Jews from the Arabian Peninsula.'

Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670). Then, after a disastrous attempt on Yafi' (in what is nowadays South Yemen), which resulted in Ibb being lost to the tribes of the eastern desert, al-Mawahib called to account the northern tribes who had failed him. In 1702 he sent his nephew to deal with 'Hamdan and their chief Ibn Hubaysh', but a truce was made instead (ibid. 428; Zabarah 1941: 297). Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_314_YeQasmi] 'But al-jirafi goes on, more importantly, to relate that al-Ahmar wrote al-Mansur al-Husayn a brusque letter demanding a meeting. The Imam feared an attempt at assassination; so he'assassinated alAhmar first, stuck his head on a lance, and galloped off with it through a hail of bullets from the shaykh's enraged tribesmen (aljirafi 1951: 182). In fact, al-Ahrnar, accompanied by Bin juzaylan of DhU Muhammad and by Ahmad Muhammad Hubaysh of Sufyan, seems to have come to 'Asir, just outside San'a', to seek a settlement (Zabarah 1941: 539 and 1958: 486). The details are probably lost forever, and we are told only that al-Ahmar 'had wished to make independent his own rule of part of the country' (ibid.), which he very well may have done; but al-Mansur alHusayn's view of the matter, as recorded in the histories, has all the vigorous clarity of the Zaydi tradition. The taunt to the tribesmen at the time was, typically, that they were no better than polytheists: he brandished al-Ahmar's head on his spear and cried 'this is the head of your idol'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_315_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).'

The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ...

Yet most adherents of the different schools of Islam reside in distinct sections of the country, and this fact has certain political implications. Zaydis, who belong to the Shia subsect of Islam, are located in the northern and eastern parts of Yemen, whereas Shafis, orthodox Sunnis, live in the southern and coastal regions. Location in the highlands apparently enables Zaydis more successfully to repel invasions than Shafis in the lower lying areas. A smaller Shia subsect, the Ismaili, and also the remnants of an ancient Jewish community, may still be found in certain parts of Yemen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_318_YeQasmi] 'As Muslims, Yemenis aspire to fulfill the five tenets of Islam: affirmation of the Islamic creed, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_319_YeQasmi] 'In the Shafi areas of Yemen, the tombs of certain holy men are visited by believers for their special healing and other powers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_320_YeQasmi] 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning. Men gather at the mosque for prayers and sermons on the Sabbath, which in Yemen occurs on Friday. Strict segregation of the sexes usually does not permit women to worship in public.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_321_YeQasmi] 'Yemenis observe the major holidays, such as Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, as well as lesser festivals in the Arabian calendar.'

Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to observe only one of these festivals (at the end of Ramadan) while I was in Khawland, though I was assured by tribesmen that the same rituals were enacted in both. On the first morning after the fast had been officially declared at an end, the old and young adult males of the village in which I was staying convened in the selah (flood plain) to greet each other with salutations peculiar to the 'id. The flood plain has special significance. In the Yemeni highlands most villages are built on rock outcrops that jut upwards from the wadi floor, the fertile fields surrounding them irrigated by canals that drain the wadi's plain when it is in flood, during the rainy season twice a year. The rest of the time the wadi floor is dry and used for a variety of purposes, including the transport of animals, the passage of people between villages located along the plain, as the meeting ground for tribal delegations who have been sent to a village to mediate one of its disputes, and for open-air markets that convene once a week. A mosque is usually situated at the rim of the flood plain and the village, casting its sacred canopy over these people and their activities. In short, the flood plain is a general thoroughfare bringing fertility, religious blessing, and hopefully also security. It is not surprising that the religious festival marking the transition of the fast and the beginning of a new year is held in a place saturated with the symbolism of passage, for, as Van Gennep ([1908] 1960) understood, ritual time is often symbolized by movement in space. In the cool hours of early morning on the first day after the fast, the hamlet of Bet al-Bahluli sends a delegation of adult males to march in the wadi toward the hamlet of Dhu l-Mukh, which in turn dispatches a group of adult males toward the former, the two groups meeting halfway. At the head of the delegations are the servants of their respective hamlets, drumming the rhythms of the bara' dance. The men behind them chant a zamil poem appropriate to the religious occasion: "The month of Shawal for Arabs is proclaimed // As the time to break the fast for those who have fasted. Happy is the faster who has been loyal to [God's] demand, // And to those who have not -may they be damned!" "We have put our trust in God. // Our lot can only increase through His generosity. O Lord, let rainds give us (water) to drink // And irrigate the crops and fields." Again, the unmarried boys watch from the sidelines, the women from their houses. As soon as the two delegations stand facing each other a few yards apart, the elder of the first arrivals begins the greeting. "Peace, O tribesmen (lit, faces," he shouts in a high, creaky voice that rises above the din of the drumming and chanting as a signal for the crowd to be silent. The elder continues as before: "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy". The presupposition of this formula, of course, is that those addressed are true believers who have remained steadfast in Ramadan. As soon as the elder has finished, the men of the opposing delegation intone in unison the response. "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy. May He protect them [the rest of the tribe] from harm." A reception line is formed by the initial group, which now welcomes the new arrivals individually. Each man shakes the other's hand and quickly kisses the back of it, muttering min as-salimin (among the saved), a shibboleth among the community of the faithful. Smiling and laughing, the group now either prays in the mosque at the rim of the flood plain or else retires to an open-air site to hear a sermon about the significance of the 'id and then join in communal prayer. This activity may last a half hour, after which time they retire to their villages behind the drummers, once again chanting zamil poems. The next morning the villagers visit each other and perhaps exchange gifts, the children often skipping from door to door to receive candy; at noon relatives assemble for large communal feasts. Everyone is very much relieved that the hardship of the fast is finally over, though perhaps their joyous mood is also tinged with a slight anticlimactic feeling because the drama of self-discipline that marks the fast has ended.'

'In the course of a wedding ceremony there are two crucial events in which zamil performances are the norm: the samrah and the groom's zaffah. The noun samrah is derived from the Arabic Form I verb samar, meaning to spend the evening with friends in restful, idle conversation. Tribesmen gather after dinner to sit and pass the time in someone's mafraj (sitting room), sometimes nearly until dawn, chatting, playing games, and perhaps even dancing. The groom's samrah is supposed to have the same elements of relaxed amusement, but it naturally differs in that the caliber of entertainment is much higher. Professional musicians, a drummer-singer and a flute player, are usually hired to perform the music to which the assembly can dance the mizmar (named after the flute), and all the adult guests are obligated to contribute some lines of verse in the competitive balah poetry or razfah. The excitement builds as the guests arrive in groups of about five to ten during the early evening hours. They are the ones referred to in the poetry as 'ajanib (foreigners). Their zamil poem echoes in the wadi basin in which they are walking and carries through the stillness of the night on high-pitched voices. Upon hearing their chant, the post of the samrah dispatches some young men to greet them at the village entrance with gun salutes and rounds of exploding firecrackers. The thoroughfare to the groom's house beckons in soft white light emanating from the garlands of bulbs strung across the house walls and is astir with children scurrying about and adults doing their rounds of visiting. There is no mistaking the groom's house, which is ablaze with lanterns, strings of bulbs, and torches. Its colored, stained-glass windows glow invitingly like embers in a hearth. The arrivals are conducted to the diwan (hall) in which the celebrants, including the groom, are waiting to receive them. [...] When the delegation has stepped into the room, the assembly rises to its feet to perform the moving ritual greeting known as hal. Room is then made in the already packed hall for the new arrivals. The most prestigious personages, such as sheikhs, are seated nearest the groom; the rest may sit anywhere on the circle according to their preference. Usually a soft, thick oriental carpet is spread under the celebrants for their comfort during the long hours of the groom's samrah; the water pipe is also available, the tobacco laced with the finest incense and the water delicately scented. Each male wears the Yemeni dagger (jambiyyah) -a curved silver blade with a gazelle-horn handle inlaid with old coins- and brings a rifle, which he hangs by its leather strap on the wall pegs. These weapons are symbolic of male fighting prowess and hence honor and the poetry is full of allusions to them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_440_YeQasmi]//'The groom has already changed into his brand-new set of clothes during the afternoon zaffah (procession). [...] Throughout the wedding ceremony the groom has to maintain a riding pose and does not participate in the event, such as the afternoon gat chews, the dancing, the poetry, or the shooting matches. He is a passive onlooker. Approximately one hour after the evening prayer, when the guests have been fed dinner, the professional musicians play a stirring drum salute called the tamsih, which incorporates in its music the rhythms of the famous bara' dance (see Adra 1982). This salute is a signal that the poetic events and dances of the evening are to begin. [...] Wedding celebrations may last several days, if not weeks, depending on the social prominence of the groom's family, and it is expected that the samrah be held on each evening of the celebration. On the lelat ad-dakhlak (night of consummation) the festivities reach their greatest intensity. Guests who cannot attend every night of the celebration try to attend at least that evening. Two genres of poetry are commonly performed at the samrah, the most important being a competitive verse composition known as the balah (the other being the dance-verse genre called the razfah). A wedding celebration is thought to be lacking if one or both of these genres is not performed; therefore, a special onus is placed on the guest to contribute in this way to the evening's entertainment. As for the zamil performance, I have already remarked that it occurs en route to the groom's village, but that is not the most crucial ceremony in which it is heard. Far more important is the groom's zaffah, the procession which begins at his house, slowly and majestically winds its way to the mosque, and then retraces its course. At the head of this procession are the village servants, who drum loudly the beat of the bara' dance. Immediately behind them are the guests of the wedding, all of them adult males, marching in columns with their rifles slung over their shoulders. They are wearing multicolored turbans, jackets, and skirts. They form what might be called the chorus of the zamil performance, one half chanting the first line of the poem and the other half chanting the second and final line; the poet usually comes from their ranks. If they feel so inclined, they might begin a dance to accompany the poetic chant and drum or shoot their files at an improvised target. All around them are the adolescent boys, too young to shoot off rifles or compose verse publicly, who gleefully light firecrackers and hurl them in the air to land usually underfoot or on the shoulders of the unsuspecting marchers, who cannot sidestep fast enough the flashing, hopping strings of fire. In the rear of the procession is the groom along with some friends or relatives bearing on their shoulders his mazharah or bouquet, which is composed of branches or acacia and sprigs of basil decjed with strings of different-colored berries, hollow eggs, and various other charms believed to ward off evil and bring good health, fertility, and prosperity. Sometimes a picture of the Haram Mosque in Mecca is stuck inside the bunch of plants, a reminder of the fundamentally sacred significance of the entire ceremony. As in the diwan, the groom is expected to maintain a solemn, dignified, and basically passive mien throughout the procession.//'Although  the women are not publicly present, they can be heard performing the peculiarly shrill ululation of joy (taghrid) from the house rooftops. Their black, veiled figures lean over the parapets four or more stories above the street, from where they throw candy to the children, who chase after these prizes through a haze of blue smoke rising from the exploding firecrackers. The whole affair is a cacophony of noise, a swirling mass of movement and color. The ideal of the poetic performance is that the guests compose a zamil to which the hosts respond; this exchange may be one of friendly teasing, or mutual recognition of honor expressed through praise and lofty compliments, of greeting, or of pious sentiments. The following is an example of such an exchange. First the host's poem: "From us good evening, [as many times as] the star revolves in the sky, // [As many times as] the rifle hits with its accurate bullets. O greeting to the guests, greetings from us all, // Which London announces and is broadcast in Iraq." The illocutionary force of the greeting is intensified by the metaphors of revolving heavenly bodies and the deadly accuracy of tribal marksmanship. Now the guest's poem: "Greetings from us. May thousands fill your mountains. // O defenders of the tribal border with the barrel of the rifle, We came from the same origins. // No one abandons his kinsmen until he dies." The guest poet returns the greeting with equal force and addresses the hosts as "defenders of the tribal border", meaning that they are therefore honorable men. Because the guest is a relative by marriage, he feels obligated to attend the wedding and affirms this obligation by declaring, "no one abandons his kinsmen until he dies.' The ideal of sociality understood as balanced exchange is upheld.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_441_YeQasmi]//Caton's material focuses on the performance of poetry: 'A small group of men -approximately six to ten in the average performance- form a circle (halgah) in the middle of the room. They face inward, their arms clasped around each other's shoulders or waists and their feet slowly moving in a simple side step (clockwise or counterclockwise; the direction of movement does not seem to matter). This circle of men is what I call a chorus, though in Arabuc they are referred to as saffen, literally two ranks (lines or groups). One rank or saff chants a refrain, and the other chants a certain part of the verse, the two groups thus alternating their canting throughout the performance of a single poem. The choristers are often the younger men of the wedding party, sometimes even adolescents, who may not yet possess the requisite skill to compose verse but are learning it by performing in the chorus. The poets, whoever they turn out to bem shut their eyes as they listen to the chanting, their faces tense with the effort of composition, their lips silently forming the lines that spring from their imagination. Confident that they have composed a well-formed verse, their faces brighten, and one among their number (which varies from two to five or even more) moves decisively toward the circle and breaks through the linked arms of the choristers, who close ranks behind him. The poet is now in the center of the performance, in the middle of the samrah, and at the heart of the wedding festivities. The collective attends the individual's chant to see how well he plays the game. Cupping one or both hands to the sides of his head, sometimes even plugging his ears with his thumbs [...] -a gesture that simultaneously projects the verse off a natural sounding board so that the whole noisy assembly can hear it and blocks out any palaver that might disturb his concentration (conindicentally this attitude is reminiscent of the mu'adhdhin, who calls the people to prayer)- he walks half of the circle's circumference and at the same time chants the first hermistich (harf) of his turn. Depending on the particular chant, the chorus might introduce at this juncture with a choral refrain, but in any case the power finishes his turn by chanting the second menistich and continuing around to close the circle. (In the case of a third hemistich, which rarely occurs, he describes another half-circle). He then immediately exits from the middle of the circle, and the chorus meanwhile picks up the chanting of the last hemistich of the poet's turn, alternating it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building the poem. The performance ought not to depend heavily on the contributions of one person, for the nit is no longer felt to be an evenly matched competition. Throughout the performance the audience is hardly ever still, except when a poet enters the circle, at which time most people want to hear what he has to say and evaluate it. They are quick to laugh at a witty line or exclaim allahu akbar (God is great) in reaction to a particularly good metaphor or adroit turn of phrase. If the poet'S gift to the groom is unsound because it breaks the rules of composition, they will start shouting boisterously harf magsus (a broken hemistich). Occasionally such rowdy criticism incites a quarrel between the poet and his audience, but he his more likely to amend the fault by quickly fashioning another hemistich. If he cannot make a speedy recovery, he will inevitably give to another poet and thereby lose face. As soon as the poet has exited the circle and the chorus has begun chanting again, the audience usually attends to its own matters -resuming a conversation, smoking the water pipe, joking, or just dozing to the hypnotic drone of the chant.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_442_YeQasmi]//'To summarize, the performance is made up of three concentric circles: the inner one is described by the poet's turn, the middle one comprises the chorus, and the outer one is formed by the seated audience. The penetration of the inner circle by the poet emerging from the outer two and then the exiting back into them is perfectly iconic of the ideal that everyone -whether a member of the audience or the chorus- may be a poet; no one is privileged. In addition, and much more significant, is the fact that the closer someone is to the center, the more intimately he becomes involved in the compositional process: the audience react to the poem, the chorus "carries" it (the Arabic word is shall, which means lift or carry), and the poet composes it. And whereas the audience and chorus look inward, the poet faces them in the middle by looking outward: the individual is alone and being judged by the collectivity. It is certainly the ultimate moment of truth, when honor is being tested and is either recognized or repudiated.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_443_YeQasmi] 'Each genre of performance-composed poetry (balah, zamil, razfah, and roshan) has its own set of melodies on which the poetry is chanted.'

imam, although sharia courts and judges were also present: 'Hakim, the standard term for “judge” (qadi was also used), as in hakim sharʿi or “shariʽa judge,” had another sense, which meant “ruler,” as in the identification of Imam Yahya as hakim al-yaman, “ruler of Yemen.?”3 In this domain of overlapping terminology a verb from the same h-k-m root, followed by bainahum (lit. “between them”) can mean “he governed” when used of an imam or, beyond the sphere of the state, ofan important rural shaykh, and “he adjudicated their case” (p.169) when used in reference to a judge. One is reminded of a similar double resonance of the English word “court,” held by both kings and judges. While the categories judge and imam are not to be confused, it is also true that the activity of governing in Yemen was in general very much devoted to settling disputes, with only a specialized part of this activity being handled by the shariʽa court variety of hakim.'

It appears that the imamate was 'ideally' passed on from father to son. But rival claimants fought amongst each other, often relying on tribal support: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_523_YeQasmi] 'Sali1}. Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670). Then, after a disastrous attempt on Yafi' (in what is nowadays South Yemen), which resulted in Ibb being lost to the tribes of the eastern desert, al-Mawahib called to account the northern tribes who had failed him. In 1702 he sent his nephew to deal with 'Hamdan and their chief Ibn Hubaysh', but a truce was made instead (ibid. 428; Zabarah 1941: 297). Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_524_YeQasmi] 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_525_YeQasmi] 'A few years later, in 1713, al-Husayn b. al-Qasim declared himself Imam in opposition to al-Mawahib, and 'Ali Hadi Hubaysh (probably Sali1}.'s brother) supported him (Zabarah 1941: 601-9). 'Ali al-Ahmar of al-Usayrnat was sent by al-Mawahib to oppose him (again, this is the first mention of the family by name), but the tribes preferred the new claimant (ibid. 356,607). The country was at one point divided among several of these rival Imams-although, significantly, none of them claimed control of the major tribes (ibid. 616)-and the struggle between.the different Qasimis dragged on, with the shaykhs holding the balance, until al-Mawahib died in 1718.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_526_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ...

Qasimid imans and their retainers and courtiers co-existed and occasionally competed with tribal shaykhs and their followers. Dresch describes the establishment of the Qasimi court: 'Besides the wealth to be extracted from the southern peasantry, the Imams of the period also had available, if they could retain control, taxes from a burgeoning coffee trade. The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_529_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_530_YeQasmi] Leading shaykhly families rose to prominence in this period: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_531_YeQasmi] The relationship between imams and tribal leaders could be supportive as well as hostile: 'Sali1}. Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670).

Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_532_YeQasmi] 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_533_YeQasmi] Conflict between rival imams also occurred and tribal support could be decisive for the outcome: 'A few years later, in 1713, al-Husayn b. al-Qasim declared himself Imam in opposition to al-Mawahib, and 'Ali Hadi Hubaysh (probably Sali1}.'s brother) supported him (Zabarah 1941: 601-9).

(al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_535_YeQasmi] 'As Stookey points out, al-Husayn's combination with the tribes against his father availed him little since when his father died, in the following year, and he claimed the Imamate himself under the title al-Mansiir, they supported his cousin, al-Nasir Muhammad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_536_YeQasmi] 'But al-jirafi goes on, more importantly, to relate that al-Ahmar wrote al-Mansur al-Husayn a brusque letter demanding a meeting. The Imam feared an attempt at assassination; so he'assassinated alAhmar first, stuck his head on a lance, and galloped off with it through a hail of bullets from the shaykh's enraged tribesmen (aljirafi 1951: 182). In fact, al-Ahrnar, accompanied by Bin juzaylan of DhU Muhammad and by Ahmad Muhammad Hubaysh of Sufyan, seems to have come to 'Asir, just outside San'a', to seek a settlement (Zabarah 1941: 539 and 1958: 486). The details are probably lost forever, and we are told only that al-Ahmar 'had wished to make independent his own rule of part of the country' (ibid.), which he very well may have done; but al-Mansur alHusayn's view of the matter, as recorded in the histories, has all the vigorous clarity of the Zaydi tradition. The taunt to the tribesmen at the time was, typically, that they were no better than polytheists: he brandished al-Ahmar's head on his spear and cried 'this is the head of your idol'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions millenarian militant movements: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam. Accounts of the rising mention several forts in the west being taken from Bayt al-Ahmar: al-Qahirah at alMahabishah was lost, then Qaradah and al-Gharnuq at Najrah, just south of Hajjah, then Sabrah, and finally the fort near alMadayir that al-Mansur had bought several years earlier (Zabarah 1941: 53-5). During the forty years since al-Mansur al-Husayn b. al-Qasim (a rival of al-Mawahib) came to power in 1712, says a contemporary witness, the state had counted for little: "The rule of 'All al-Ahmar and his sons after him and of other tribesmen from Hashid remained over-great and excessive until God destroyed what they had built and extinguished their flame, proclaiming their weakness and perdition by the appearance of this dervish. (Quoted ibid. 54)' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_538_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders held lands, collected taxes, and defended forts, enabling them to form a power base in their own right: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_539_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_540_YeQasmi] However, written records are often silent on these matters: 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_541_YeQasmi] In addition, sayyids also quarreled amongst themselves: 'AI-Mahdi al-iAbbas (1748-75) was very much a Sanani Imam, being based on the city throughout his reign. Among learned San'anis he retained a high reputation (al-Shawkani 19 29: 310-12; Serjeant 1983: 85 ff.), but it is plain that all was not well elsewhere. Abu 'Alamah's 175I rising in the north-west has already been mentioned. Two years earlier a campaign had been fought in Lower Yemen against a 'sorcerer' who promised his followers immunity against sword wounds and gun shots.V In the year before that, Hasan al-Tlkarn, of the qadi family from Barat and the north-east, was leading tribesmen at odds with the new Imam in Lower Yemen (Zabarah 1958: 684)Y In both the west and the south, the incursion of tribesmen over the preceding generation had not been quietly absorbed, and the affairs of the Barat tribes in particular (Dhii Muhammad and Dhu Husayn) became involved with those of the Imam's capital at San'a'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_542_YeQasmi] 'The connections of learning which were often important in an Imam's rise to power (Ch. 5) could also readily generalize a threat to that power if one emerged; and the language of equality, justice, and religious probity linked the learned with the tribesmen also. In 17 68, for instance, the 'ulamd' of Barat (particularly Bayt al-'Ansi) wrote to Zaydi centres such as Huth and Dhamar, calling for the expulsion of al-Mahdi al-Abbas and his Qasimi relatives on doctrinal grounds (al-jirafi 1951: 187; Zabarah 1958: 521-2; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 134-5), though the Barat tribes' incursions in preceding years suggest that doctrinal detail was not the main motive force (see e.g. Zabarah 1958: 13).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_543_YeQasmi] 'The Qasimis were accused of 'innovations' (bida'). Zaydism had always recognized ijtihad (the formation of new law by extrapolation from scripture), but in the mid-eighteenth century a pronounced movement of criticism was under way. Ibn al-Amir, for instance, a Zaydi scholar who kept his political distance from the Imamate, blurred the distinction between his own school and the Shafi'i,14 with the result that conspicuous details, such as postures of prayer, became matters of contention among those less learned than he. The Barat qadis blamed the Qasimis for supporting him. On at least one occasion, an intestine squabble among San'ani 'ulamd' over mosque appointments, phrased in these terms, led one faction to demand arbitration from al-'Ansi, 'the qadi of Hashid and Bakil' (Zabarah 1941: 617), rather than from their Qasimi rulers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_544_YeQasmi] Imams were often reduced to negotiate protection money with tribes under the threat of incursions: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_545_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mansiir 'All b. al-Mahdi (1775-1809) was, like his father, a San'ani Imam, and from the city's point of view was at first a considerable success (Serjeant 1983: 86-7; al-Shawkani 1929: i. 359 ff.). But at the state's periphery, Sharif Harniid of Abu Arish was forced south by the Nejd Wahhabis into territory the Imamate had held or at least had part access to. The resulting loss of port revenue was almost certainly serious. I? From now on, the Imams' ability to buy off the tribes declined sharply.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_546_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_547_YeQasmi] This lead to a gradual break-down of imamic authority: 'In 1823 a severe drought in the east forced a meeting of tribes at Jabal Barat, where they decided to seek aid from the Imam. When he refused and they turned on Lower Yemen, he seems to have been able to do nothing but warn others they were coming. 'When they reached Sarnarah [the pass that is sometimes taken to define Lower Yemen's border; see Chapter I], each put down his pledge on a place, and they divided it all up as if their father had left them the land as inheritance' (al-Hibshi 1980: 34). It is quite possible, of course, that many had indeed been left inheritance there, either property or presumed rights to 'fiefs' (quta'): they had been involved with the area for the best part of a century. From 1823 onwards, though, they are said to have held the area unopposed: 'they took control of it by force and coercion, then settled there, married there, and forgot the east until the Faqih Sa'Id threw them out in [1840]' (ibid.i.l" Even that was not sufficient, and when a further drought struck in 1835, Dhii Husayn, under Muhsin 'Ali alShayif, began raiding the north-west, while their women and children moved westwards by themselves in great numbers (ibid. 60-2). The Tiharnah had meanwhile fallen to the Egyptians.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_548_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, in San'a', the Imamate under al-Mansiir 'All b. alMahdi 'Abdullah lost not only its resources but its ~oral vigour: 'drunkenness was the prevailing vice among the higher orders, and ... the corpses of men, women and children lay about the streets, no one taking the trouble to bury them .. .' (Playfair 1859: 145)· Al-Mansiir squabbled with one of his relatives, who fled to Ta'izz and handed it over to the Egyptians. Al-Nasir 'Abdullah Ahsan was then raised to the Imamate by the soldiers in San'a', only to be assassinated at Wadi Dahr in 1840.19 Al-Hadi Muhammad took the throne and succeeded briefly in regaining Mocha and Ta'izz, but when the Egyptians withdrew-under indirect pressure from Britain (Baldry 1976: I6I)-the Tiharnah fell under the control of Sharif Husayn.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_549_YeQasmi] 'The geographical pattern of power had now changed beyond recognition. Hashid (led in part by the qadis of Bayt Hanash), were in Raymah, as well as further north in the western mountains, Dhii Muhammad and Dhii Husayn were in the south, as well as in the Tihamah, and all were involved with Yam, whose homeland in Najran had usually been outside the field of Yemeni events but whose presence in Haraz and the Tiharnah was nothing new. The land of Hashid and Bakil, on the northern plateau, was itself a dead centre to the whirl of events involving tribesmen elsewhere. Sharif Husayn's movements in 1845 make the point: starting from the north-west, in the Tihamah, he moved to the south, around Ta'izz, then to Barat, in the extreme north-east (al-Hibshi 1980: 120-31). The Imamate, at San'a', retained a mere rump of territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_550_YeQasmi] 'There was -violence enough in the north itself, particularly in times of drought (see e.g. ibid. 306); but the tribal divisions, one should note, changed very little, and then rather in a longue duree than in the order of events recorded year by year. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the geographical detail even of sections within tribes changes hardly at all from al-Qasim's time (early seventeenth century) to our own, and where change occurs it does so by recognizable quanta. Inequality and movement alike are registered in other terms. The prominence of major shaykhs, for instance, whom the tribesmen followed much as they did Imams, derived from wealth in the west and in Lower Yemen, and this is also where the great non-quantum shifts in territorial control resulted from tribesmen fighting each other. Inequality, power, and geographical change all attach, not to tribal self-definition, but to the history of successive Imams, to the history of a tradition or of a dynasty; and the dynasty had, by this point, collapsed because it had lost control of non-tribal land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_551_YeQasmi] 'The Imams' attempts to regain the south met with little success. Ahmad Salih Thawabah of Dhu Muhammad, who had controlled a large&nbsp;;wa~he of Lower Yemen, was defeated by al-Mutawakkil Muhammad and finally executed in 1848, to the delight of the Imam's supporters (Dresch 1987b). Within three years, however, his sons were formally granted land in much the same area (al-Hibshi 1980: 166). In the interim the Imam had been forced to send Dhii Muhammad horses as slaughter-beasts ('aqa'ir), which they took but did not have killed, and then pay them to fight again in the south (ibid. 146).20 Dhu Muhammad, Dhii Husayn, Arhab, Khawlan, and Hashid were also all fighting in the west, on the Imam's side, the Sharif's, or both; but the Ottoman Turks now seized the Tihamah. Hufash, near al-Mahwit, and al-Haymah were both contested, and several rival claimants to the Imamate appeared at once.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_552_YeQasmi] This enabled the eventual Ottoman re-conquest: 'In despair al-Mutawakkil asked the Turks to intervene in the highlands. They arrived at San'a' in 1849 with 1,200 foot and 500 horse, but a riot ensued and they withdrew after only three weeks (Zabarah 1929: ii, 346 ff.; al-Sayaghi 1978: 25-7). AlMutawakkil was killed by his rivals. One of the Ashraf of the northern Tihamah, supported by 'a large following from Hashid, was then bought off with a gift of 2,000 riyals, robes of honour, and a horse (al-Sayaghi 1978: 31). The combination of a Tihamah Sharif and Hashid at the gates of San'a' is symptomatic enough of the Imamate's weakness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_553_YeQasmi] 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO). They were to remain in highland Yemen until 19 18.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_554_YeQasmi] 'For much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, then, Yemen had been plagued by disputes between rival Imams and by tribal disorder. The Imamate had taken the form of an elaborate dynastic state, yet failed to secure the means to support itself or to transmit authority without dispute. Al-Shamahi credits the Qasimi dawlah with surviving until the middle of the nineteenth century. In name it did. He rationalizes the great decline of its power by saying that al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad (d. 1686) was the last of the Qasimis to possess all the qualities needed of an Imam, and that the rulers after him were more like kings (al-Shamahi 1972: 144-6). Similarly, al-Wazir (1971: 50) attributes the collapse of the state to the appearance of 'evil Imams'. Authors writing nearer the time each choose some point at which the real decline starts, always simply by reference to the actions or fate of a particular Imam (e.g. al-Hibshi 1980: 193).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_555_YeQasmi] While shaykhs were not bureaucrats, advisers and courtiers of the imams may have been. The imams may also have employed scribes. More material is needed.

Qasimid imans and their retainers and courtiers co-existed and occasionally competed with tribal shaykhs and their followers. Dresch describes the establishment of the Qasimi court: 'Besides the wealth to be extracted from the southern peasantry, the Imams of the period also had available, if they could retain control, taxes from a burgeoning coffee trade. The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_556_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_557_YeQasmi] Leading shaykhly families rose to prominence in this period: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_558_YeQasmi] The relationship between imams and tribal leaders could be supportive as well as hostile: 'Sali1}. Hubaysh of Sufyan is first mentioned in 1698 as putting down a revolt of Raymah and Wa~ab (south-west of San'a') against al-Mawahib's governor: women's earrings taken by his men were sold in San'a' with fragments of ear still attached, provoking certain 'ulama's» preach against Hubaysh's cruelty (Zabarah 195 8: 670). Then, after a disastrous attempt on Yafi' (in what is nowadays South Yemen), which resulted in Ibb being lost to the tribes of the eastern desert, al-Mawahib called to account the northern tribes who had failed him. In 1702 he sent his nephew to deal with 'Hamdan and their chief Ibn Hubaysh', but a truce was made instead (ibid. 428; Zabarah 1941: 297). Five years later, after another failure in Yafi', al-Mawahib sent al-Qasim b. al-Husayn and Sali1}. Hubaysh to Khamir to deal with Hashid, where the two fell out. In 1709 Hubaysh was again sent to Khamir by alMawahib, this time to deal with al-Qasim, but Hubaysh was finally tricked and killed there (ibid. 778-80; Zabarah 1958: 357)·' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_559_YeQasmi] 'In the intervening period he had been placed in charge of an army to fight the tribes of the east and Yafi'. Al-Mawahib had ordered his minister to strike a balance between Hubaysh and Bin juzaylan of Dhii Muhammad (again, this is the earliest clear reference to this famous family), but the governor's own aim was to balance the pair of them with the eastern tribes whom the Imam wanted conquered. The result of his intrigue was that the two Bakil chiefs opposed each other and the easterners won (ibid. 875; Zabarah 1941: 773). Soon after this Hubaysh was sent with al-Qasim b. al-Husayn to Hiith, and the Imam's men razed a house nearby which belonged to Muhammad 'Ali al-Gharibi of Hashid (ibid. 778-80; id. 1958: 684; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 46), who, as we shall see, is probably Bayt al-Ahmar's immediate forebear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_560_YeQasmi] Conflict between rival imams also occurred and tribal support could be decisive for the outcome: 'A few years later, in 1713, al-Husayn b. al-Qasim declared himself Imam in opposition to al-Mawahib, and 'Ali Hadi Hubaysh (probably Sali1}.'s brother) supported him (Zabarah 1941: 601-9). 'Ali al-Ahmar of al-Usayrnat was sent by al-Mawahib to oppose him (again, this is the first mention of the family by name), but the tribes preferred the new claimant (ibid. 356,607). The country was at one point divided among several of these rival Imams-although, significantly, none of them claimed control of the major tribes (ibid. 616)-and the struggle between.the different Qasimis dragged on, with the shaykhs holding the balance, until al-Mawahib died in 1718.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_561_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ... (al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_562_YeQasmi] 'As Stookey points out, al-Husayn's combination with the tribes against his father availed him little since when his father died, in the following year, and he claimed the Imamate himself under the title al-Mansiir, they supported his cousin, al-Nasir Muhammad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_563_YeQasmi] 'But al-jirafi goes on, more importantly, to relate that al-Ahmar wrote al-Mansur al-Husayn a brusque letter demanding a meeting. The Imam feared an attempt at assassination; so he'assassinated alAhmar first, stuck his head on a lance, and galloped off with it through a hail of bullets from the shaykh's enraged tribesmen (aljirafi 1951: 182). In fact, al-Ahrnar, accompanied by Bin juzaylan of DhU Muhammad and by Ahmad Muhammad Hubaysh of Sufyan, seems to have come to 'Asir, just outside San'a', to seek a settlement (Zabarah 1941: 539 and 1958: 486). The details are probably lost forever, and we are told only that al-Ahmar 'had wished to make independent his own rule of part of the country' (ibid.), which he very well may have done; but al-Mansur alHusayn's view of the matter, as recorded in the histories, has all the vigorous clarity of the Zaydi tradition. The taunt to the tribesmen at the time was, typically, that they were no better than polytheists: he brandished al-Ahmar's head on his spear and cried 'this is the head of your idol'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_564_YeQasmi] Dresch also mentions millenarian militant movements: 'In 175I, however, a millenarian rising broke out in the western mountains, led by Abu 'AIamah, a black 'magician' who preached a puritanical renewal of Islam. Accounts of the rising mention several forts in the west being taken from Bayt al-Ahmar: al-Qahirah at alMahabishah was lost, then Qaradah and al-Gharnuq at Najrah, just south of Hajjah, then Sabrah, and finally the fort near alMadayir that al-Mansur had bought several years earlier (Zabarah 1941: 53-5). During the forty years since al-Mansur al-Husayn b. al-Qasim (a rival of al-Mawahib) came to power in 1712, says a contemporary witness, the state had counted for little: "The rule of 'All al-Ahmar and his sons after him and of other tribesmen from Hashid remained over-great and excessive until God destroyed what they had built and extinguished their flame, proclaiming their weakness and perdition by the appearance of this dervish. (Quoted ibid. 54)' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_565_YeQasmi] Tribal leaders held lands, collected taxes, and defended forts, enabling them to form a power base in their own right: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_566_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_567_YeQasmi] However, written records are often silent on these matters: 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_568_YeQasmi] In addition, sayyids also quarreled amongst themselves: 'AI-Mahdi al-iAbbas (1748-75) was very much a Sanani Imam, being based on the city throughout his reign. Among learned San'anis he retained a high reputation (al-Shawkani 19 29: 310-12; Serjeant 1983: 85 ff.), but it is plain that all was not well elsewhere. Abu 'Alamah's 175I rising in the north-west has already been mentioned. Two years earlier a campaign had been fought in Lower Yemen against a 'sorcerer' who promised his followers immunity against sword wounds and gun shots.V In the year before that, Hasan al-Tlkarn, of the qadi family from Barat and the north-east, was leading tribesmen at odds with the new Imam in Lower Yemen (Zabarah 1958: 684)Y In both the west and the south, the incursion of tribesmen over the preceding generation had not been quietly absorbed, and the affairs of the Barat tribes in particular (Dhii Muhammad and Dhu Husayn) became involved with those of the Imam's capital at San'a'.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_569_YeQasmi] 'The connections of learning which were often important in an Imam's rise to power (Ch. 5) could also readily generalize a threat to that power if one emerged; and the language of equality, justice, and religious probity linked the learned with the tribesmen also. In 17 68, for instance, the 'ulamd' of Barat (particularly Bayt al-'Ansi) wrote to Zaydi centres such as Huth and Dhamar, calling for the expulsion of al-Mahdi al-Abbas and his Qasimi relatives on doctrinal grounds (al-jirafi 1951: 187; Zabarah 1958: 521-2; al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 134-5), though the Barat tribes' incursions in preceding years suggest that doctrinal detail was not the main motive force (see e.g. Zabarah 1958: 13).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_570_YeQasmi] 'The Qasimis were accused of 'innovations' (bida'). Zaydism had always recognized ijtihad (the formation of new law by extrapolation from scripture), but in the mid-eighteenth century a pronounced movement of criticism was under way. Ibn al-Amir, for instance, a Zaydi scholar who kept his political distance from the Imamate, blurred the distinction between his own school and the Shafi'i,14 with the result that conspicuous details, such as postures of prayer, became matters of contention among those less learned than he. The Barat qadis blamed the Qasimis for supporting him. On at least one occasion, an intestine squabble among San'ani 'ulamd' over mosque appointments, phrased in these terms, led one faction to demand arbitration from al-'Ansi, 'the qadi of Hashid and Bakil' (Zabarah 1941: 617), rather than from their Qasimi rulers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_571_YeQasmi] Imams were often reduced to negotiate protection money with tribes under the threat of incursions: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_572_YeQasmi] 'Al-Mansiir 'All b. al-Mahdi (1775-1809) was, like his father, a San'ani Imam, and from the city's point of view was at first a considerable success (Serjeant 1983: 86-7; al-Shawkani 1929: i. 359 ff.). But at the state's periphery, Sharif Harniid of Abu Arish was forced south by the Nejd Wahhabis into territory the Imamate had held or at least had part access to. The resulting loss of port revenue was almost certainly serious. I? From now on, the Imams' ability to buy off the tribes declined sharply.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_573_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, al-Mansur's grip on affairs failed when his sons fell out with each other, and the qadis of Bayt al-'Ulufi fell out with those of Bayt al-'Ansi, in part over stipends to the tribes (al-jirafi 1951: 192; al-tAmri 1985: 52-64; al-Hibshi 1980: 4; Zabarah 1929: i, 343-4). In 1818, in the time of the Imam al-Mahdi, a large body of tribesmen from Barat arrived at the capital in search of pay to fight in the Tiharnah (al-Hibshi 1980: 18). The Imam, having collected support of his own from Khawlan and Nihm, had 'All 'Abdullah al-Shayif of Dhii Husayn beheaded and the body strung up for three days, then thrown in the rubbish ditch outside Bab Sha'ub (ibid. 20-1; Zabarah 1929: ii. 66). But Bayt al-Shayif's call for support to avenge this was answered by Wa'ilah, Hashid, al' Amalisah, Sufyan, and Arhab, among others; in short, by tribes from as far away as what is now the Saudi border. They looted the city's outskirts and carried off enough plunder 'to suffice the son's son' (ibid. 23-4; al-Arnri 1985: 88-91).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_574_YeQasmi] This lead to a gradual break-down of imamic authority: 'In 1823 a severe drought in the east forced a meeting of tribes at Jabal Barat, where they decided to seek aid from the Imam. When he refused and they turned on Lower Yemen, he seems to have been able to do nothing but warn others they were coming. 'When they reached Sarnarah [the pass that is sometimes taken to define Lower Yemen's border; see Chapter I], each put down his pledge on a place, and they divided it all up as if their father had left them the land as inheritance' (al-Hibshi 1980: 34). It is quite possible, of course, that many had indeed been left inheritance there, either property or presumed rights to 'fiefs' (quta'): they had been involved with the area for the best part of a century. From 1823 onwards, though, they are said to have held the area unopposed: 'they took control of it by force and coercion, then settled there, married there, and forgot the east until the Faqih Sa'Id threw them out in [1840]' (ibid.i.l" Even that was not sufficient, and when a further drought struck in 1835, Dhii Husayn, under Muhsin 'Ali alShayif, began raiding the north-west, while their women and children moved westwards by themselves in great numbers (ibid. 60-2). The Tiharnah had meanwhile fallen to the Egyptians.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_575_YeQasmi] 'At the centre, in San'a', the Imamate under al-Mansiir 'All b. alMahdi 'Abdullah lost not only its resources but its ~oral vigour: 'drunkenness was the prevailing vice among the higher orders, and ... the corpses of men, women and children lay about the streets, no one taking the trouble to bury them .. .' (Playfair 1859: 145)· Al-Mansiir squabbled with one of his relatives, who fled to Ta'izz and handed it over to the Egyptians. Al-Nasir 'Abdullah Ahsan was then raised to the Imamate by the soldiers in San'a', only to be assassinated at Wadi Dahr in 1840.19 Al-Hadi Muhammad took the throne and succeeded briefly in regaining Mocha and Ta'izz, but when the Egyptians withdrew-under indirect pressure from Britain (Baldry 1976: I6I)-the Tiharnah fell under the control of Sharif Husayn.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_576_YeQasmi] 'The geographical pattern of power had now changed beyond recognition. Hashid (led in part by the qadis of Bayt Hanash), were in Raymah, as well as further north in the western mountains, Dhii Muhammad and Dhii Husayn were in the south, as well as in the Tihamah, and all were involved with Yam, whose homeland in Najran had usually been outside the field of Yemeni events but whose presence in Haraz and the Tiharnah was nothing new. The land of Hashid and Bakil, on the northern plateau, was itself a dead centre to the whirl of events involving tribesmen elsewhere. Sharif Husayn's movements in 1845 make the point: starting from the north-west, in the Tihamah, he moved to the south, around Ta'izz, then to Barat, in the extreme north-east (al-Hibshi 1980: 120-31). The Imamate, at San'a', retained a mere rump of territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_577_YeQasmi] 'There was -violence enough in the north itself, particularly in times of drought (see e.g. ibid. 306); but the tribal divisions, one should note, changed very little, and then rather in a longue duree than in the order of events recorded year by year. As we shall see in Chapter 9, the geographical detail even of sections within tribes changes hardly at all from al-Qasim's time (early seventeenth century) to our own, and where change occurs it does so by recognizable quanta. Inequality and movement alike are registered in other terms. The prominence of major shaykhs, for instance, whom the tribesmen followed much as they did Imams, derived from wealth in the west and in Lower Yemen, and this is also where the great non-quantum shifts in territorial control resulted from tribesmen fighting each other. Inequality, power, and geographical change all attach, not to tribal self-definition, but to the history of successive Imams, to the history of a tradition or of a dynasty; and the dynasty had, by this point, collapsed because it had lost control of non-tribal land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_578_YeQasmi] 'The Imams' attempts to regain the south met with little success. Ahmad Salih Thawabah of Dhu Muhammad, who had controlled a large&nbsp;;wa~he of Lower Yemen, was defeated by al-Mutawakkil Muhammad and finally executed in 1848, to the delight of the Imam's supporters (Dresch 1987b). Within three years, however, his sons were formally granted land in much the same area (al-Hibshi 1980: 166). In the interim the Imam had been forced to send Dhii Muhammad horses as slaughter-beasts ('aqa'ir), which they took but did not have killed, and then pay them to fight again in the south (ibid. 146).20 Dhu Muhammad, Dhii Husayn, Arhab, Khawlan, and Hashid were also all fighting in the west, on the Imam's side, the Sharif's, or both; but the Ottoman Turks now seized the Tihamah. Hufash, near al-Mahwit, and al-Haymah were both contested, and several rival claimants to the Imamate appeared at once.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_579_YeQasmi] This enabled the eventual Ottoman re-conquest: 'In despair al-Mutawakkil asked the Turks to intervene in the highlands. They arrived at San'a' in 1849 with 1,200 foot and 500 horse, but a riot ensued and they withdrew after only three weeks (Zabarah 1929: ii, 346 ff.; al-Sayaghi 1978: 25-7). AlMutawakkil was killed by his rivals. One of the Ashraf of the northern Tihamah, supported by 'a large following from Hashid, was then bought off with a gift of 2,000 riyals, robes of honour, and a horse (al-Sayaghi 1978: 31). The combination of a Tihamah Sharif and Hashid at the gates of San'a' is symptomatic enough of the Imamate's weakness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_580_YeQasmi] 'From the summary histories one forms an impression of steadily increasing disorder through the next twenty years, until 'the people of San'a' and others' invited the Turks again to take the city 'after they had tired of the chaos which prevailed there, the dominion of men from the tribes, the cutting of the roads, and the lack of any ordered security' (al-jirafi 1951: 205-6). A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO). They were to remain in highland Yemen until 19 18.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_581_YeQasmi] 'For much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, then, Yemen had been plagued by disputes between rival Imams and by tribal disorder. The Imamate had taken the form of an elaborate dynastic state, yet failed to secure the means to support itself or to transmit authority without dispute. Al-Shamahi credits the Qasimi dawlah with surviving until the middle of the nineteenth century. In name it did. He rationalizes the great decline of its power by saying that al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad (d. 1686) was the last of the Qasimis to possess all the qualities needed of an Imam, and that the rulers after him were more like kings (al-Shamahi 1972: 144-6). Similarly, al-Wazir (1971: 50) attributes the collapse of the state to the appearance of 'evil Imams'. Authors writing nearer the time each choose some point at which the real decline starts, always simply by reference to the actions or fate of a particular Imam (e.g. al-Hibshi 1980: 193).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_582_YeQasmi] While shaykhs were not bureaucrats, advisers and courtiers of the imams may have been. The imams may also have employed scribes. More material is needed.

Informal tribal law was important and remained so even in the 19th and 20th centuries: 'A strict and complex code of honor based on tribal values governs behavior among groups and proper decorum between the sexes, including veiling of women in urban or northern areas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_583_YeQasmi] 'The cultural concept of honor also regulates the handling of disputes, which depends on confirming significant kinship ties.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_584_YeQasmi] 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_585_YeQasmi] But Islamic legal scholarship has a long history in Yemen as a guarantor of status and in the settling of disputes: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_586_YeQasmi] Judges were encouraged to be attentive to local custom in the adjudication of disputes: 'In the most general sense, the ʿurf of a place (ʿuif al-balad) refers to the established usages in all the domains of social life. An initial issue is the level of locale (balad) referred to. It might be possible to speak, for example, of the ʿ urf of Yemen, but what is usually highlighted by the term is regional difference, variation. The ʿ urf of a place could be said to be similar to (or even include) special linguistic usage, with ʿ urf differing frorn locale to locale in much the same way regional dialects shade one into the other. Measures are a good example: each highland region had its own terminology of particular linear and volume units. A judge posted to Ibb from somewhere in Upper Yemen had to learn the local terms and the measures indicated. I t was not a difference of yards and meters, however; to the extent that the judge knew something of units of land and quantities of grain in his home district he would find similar types of measurement categories used in Ibb.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_587_YeQasmi] 'A judge had to concern himself mainly with ʿurf that was relevant to the applied shariʽa, Inasmuch as the shariʽa is general or summary in its provisions, there are two basic ways it could be extended or given necessary detail. One is through the activities of interpretation, which “fill in gaps” in the shariʽaʾs conceptual structure as needed. The other is by reliance on the existing detailed structures of local usage, or turf, a patchwork backdrop of practices that showed through the gaps in the shariʽa fabric. Although “custom” as an integrated and elaborated (p.183) category of law was never elevated to a position of theoretical prominence by jurists, a widely accepted judicial attitude toward such usage is summarized in a simple formula cited by Ibb judge al-Haddad: “If no relevant [shariʽa] text is found, then that which is known customarily is taken to be a binding condition” (idh lam yujad nassan fa-l-ma ʿruf ʿurfan ka-l-rnashrut shartan).36 This view speaks not to situations of conflict between shariʽa and ʿurf, which are not tolerated by jurists, but to areas of substantive concern about which the shariʽa is silent.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_588_YeQasmi] 'There are numerous substantive areas in the manuals where the judge is specifically directed to supply necessary detail by reference to prevailing custom.37 Often this is by means of the expressions “ʿurf” or “ʿurf al-balad,” but the same sense obtains in a number of alternative terms, used in the manuals and in Ibb practice, such as al-maruf (“the known”), al-mashhur (“the known”), al-ada (“custom”-as in “Adat Law” in Southeast Asia), al-muʿtad (“the customary”). Still other terms reveal an openness to contextual grounding in the specifics of many shariʾa provisions. Mithl, meaning “like” or “similar,” is often used to this end. The amount of money that must be paid to the wife by the husband as mahr is not set in the manuals; instead the amount is characterized as mahr al-mithl, that is, a sum to be determined according to what is locally appropriate for women of equivalent status. Another example, mentioned earlier, concerns the “seriousness” (muruʾa) of a potential witness, which is to be evaluated relative to the standard of seriousness current in the local community, that is, muruʾat al-mithl.38 Many monetary and other questions are to be determined by reference to similar local circumstances of “time and place,” a frequently encountered manual formula that rhymes in Arabic (zaman wa makan).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_589_YeQasmi] 'Two specific and relatively bounded varieties of ʿurf that an Ibb judge usually knew something about and occasionally dealt with officially were the custom of the merchants (ʿurf al-tujjar) and “tribal” custom (ʿurf al-qabili). The first is a body of detailed local practices opened up around the core transactional forms of the applied jurisprudence (sale, lease, credit, partnership, agency, etc.). Ibb merchants always tended to handle their disputes informally among themselves rather than appearing in shariʽa tribunals. With advancing commercialization in recent years, this separation was formalized with the appearance of chambers of commerce (with arbitration functions) and, a few years later, commercial courts (established in the three largest townsj.39 The second type of custom concerns rules elaborated mostly (p.184) beyond the physical and conceptual bounds of the shariʽa, although “tribal” practices such as the hajar, an animal sacrifice used to appease abused honor and preceded by a public procession, occurs fairly frequently in Ibb town.40 In some regions, a judge was expected to be conversant with two discourses, to “provide shariʽa rulings in shariʽa matters and customary rulings for customary issues.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_590_YeQasmi] 'ʿUrf is also procedural. Formal and official shariʽa courts are paralleled in Ibb by an important alternative resolution format of an unofficial and customary nature. While shariʽa court adjudication procedures result in winners and losers, the customary formula is compromise (sulh). Customary compromise represents a foil for the court in a sense that goes beyond the alternative that it represents to a state forum, substantive shariʽa jurisprudence, and formal adjudication. Men gather in the sitting rooms of private houses for this compromise type of settling, and the meeting of faces involved is quite different from that in a public muwajaha. Whereas court procedure is based on extended and frequently damaging verbal confrontations between the adversaries, compromises work through separation and avoidance. Each of the parties is talked to alone; views are aired, and potential solutions are suggested. Mediators motivated by goodwill can cut through the posturing and lying that plague the tribunal. Unlike the cool and narrow effort to focus upon manifest facts (al-zahir) in the judge's court, mediators freely explore issues in breadth and in depth, “studying hearts,” as one put it. It is only when a compromise has been reached that the parties are brought together to seal the agreement. At the session, usually over an afternoon of qat chewing, the matter at hand is not overtly mentioned. The final settlement is effected through writing. If there are last-minute hitches, mediators step out of the room briefly for further words. As the conversation in the room is steered in other directions, final documents are prepared and then unobtrusively passed along to the parties for their signatures. Others present-relatives, friends, and neighbors-add their names as witnesses. In this manner two “faces” meet each other in the presence of assembled men: the genius of sitting-room compromises is that they permit the intact honor of each man to confront the other, without either being put into question.'

This remains in need of confirmation. Political leadership and judicial duties overlapped in the person of the imam, but sharia courts and judges were also present: 'Hakim, the standard term for “judge” (qadi was also used), as in hakim sharʿi or “shariʽa judge,” had another sense, which meant “ruler,” as in the identification of Imam Yahya as hakim al-yaman, “ruler of Yemen.?”3 In this domain of overlapping terminology a verb from the same h-k-m root, followed by bainahum (lit. “between them”) can mean “he governed” when used of an imam or, beyond the sphere of the state, ofan important rural shaykh, and “he adjudicated their case” (p.169) when used in reference to a judge. One is reminded of a similar double resonance of the English word “court,” held by both kings and judges. While the categories judge and imam are not to be confused, it is also true that the activity of governing in Yemen was in general very much devoted to settling disputes, with only a specialized part of this activity being handled by the shariʽa court variety of hakim.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_592_YeQasmi] Messick describes the interaction of imams, judges and muftis with the public: 'To Yemenis, judges in this type of open setting, accessible to the public, appeared in a posture known as muwajaha, from wajh meaning “face,” the quintessential face-to-face encounter of official public life (see fig. 9). Muwajaha was also the format in which the mufti received afternoon fatwa seekers, and the same sort of generic activity was characteristic as well of both ruling imams and local governors. Direct accessibility, based on a public presence that enabled personal encounters and personal solutions to problems, was a fundamental value of the old administrative style.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_593_YeQasmi] 'Like Saint Louis under his oak at Vincennes, Imam Yahya was well known for his daily practice of making himself available to his subjects. The tradition went back more than a millennium to the conduct of the first Zaidi imam in Yemen, al-Hadi.4 and the scene was nearly identical to that enacted on the local level by judges in twentieth-century Ibb. “Every morning,” the historian al-Wasiʿi 1928: 295-96) writes, “the Imam himself sat in the courtyard of his palace, Dar al-Saʿada, to hear for himself people's petitions.” “Himself” is repeated to emphasize the physical presence of the imam. “The decrepit, the weak (datif), women, children, the long-suffering came to him [and he met them with] a warm, sympathetic, solicitous and unpretentious countenance. This [activity] was the centerpiece of his desire to extend justice and equity.”5 Attentiveness to the needs and problems of the downtrodden and the people oflower status was a sign ofjust government in general6 and a value in judicial procedure in particular, as expressed in the manual principle of giving precedence to the claim of the “weak.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_594_YeQasmi] 'At noon, followed by a few soldier-retainers and a crowd of people, the imam would walk to the mosque, continuing to hear petitions even as he washed in preparation for prayer. After lunch, like the local mufti, judges, and governor in Ibb, the imam would appear in his diwan, the semipublic sitting room in his own palace-residence. There his secretaries would gather around him to engage in reading and responding to petitions that had arrived from around the country. Again, in a manner characterized by personal involvement with each and every (p.170) case, he would “attend to the papers one by one, [including] the simple and the momentous.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_595_YeQasmi] Direct appeals to the relevant judicial officials were important: 'Central to the muwajaha format was the notion of responsiveness. An “official,” al-masʾul, was literally “the one asked.” What was sought from an imam or a governor, a mufti or a judge, was an “answer” (a jawab). In the case of the mufti, a query was posed and the answer was the fatwa. For the other three dispute-handling public officials, the imam in the capital and the governor and the judge on the provincial level, the approach was made in the form of a complaint or petition, known as a shakwa. Historically, shakwas were the general means by which individuals initiated actions in which they wanted to involve the state.9 Whether these were individual-state matters (employment, state credit, charity disbursement, tax matters) or individual-individual ones (p.171) (disputes of all sorts) pursued through the state, the shakwa always represented the opening move.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_596_YeQasmi] 'The basic procedure for obtaining justice, for finding relief from injustice (zulm), through the state, was thus a direct appeal to an official, one ofwhorn was the shariʽa judge. In his well-known Hadith commentary al-Nawawi summarizes the pattern as follows: “The wronged person can seek relief from the sultan and the judge, and other appointed officials, asking for redress from the offending person, saying ‘So and so has wronged me,’ or ‘So and so did this or that to me’” (quoted in al-Shawkani A.H. 1394: 14). The vocabulary of zulm-the mazlum (wronged person), zalim (offending person), ralama (to wrong), tarallum (to complain or seek relief)-is precisely that utilized in shakwas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_597_YeQasmi] On the local level, governors and judges co-existed with sometimes over-lapping judicial duties: 'In many Muslim states, from an early date, mazalim jurisdictions, as they became known (from the same z-l-m root), amounted to alternate or superior forums for handling disputes.12 The existence of such competing forums partly contradicted the supposedly universal jurisdictional sweep of the shariʽa court, especially if matters contained within the purview of the shariʽa were as a consequence not dealt with by the shariʽa judge. In imamic Yemen, this contradiction worked a bit differently than in the typical Sunni state, headed by a sultan or a king. Condensed in the identity of the imam were both a sultan's temporal capacity to handle grievances such as salary arrears, petitions for transfer of position, or complaints about an official's conduct, and the full shariʽa capacity of the ultimate judge (and mufti) in the land. While there was for this reason no open contradiction or separation of powers at the apex of the imamic systern of rule, at the local level of the governorates there opened up two distinct positions: the shariʽa judge (hakim) and the governor inaʾib, ʿamil i. These separate delegations (wilaya) of capacity, undivided in the identity of the imam, meant that dispute settlement on the level of the provincial town involved a division of labor between the hakim's capacity to handle shariʽa matters (p.172) and the governor's capacity to handle problems defined as being of another sort-roughly, the maralim jurisidiction formula.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_598_YeQasmi] Personal presence was valued: 'Proper conduct of the muwajaha style of government depended on the elimination and avoidance of barriers between ruler and ruled. The barriers at issue were both physical-walls, closed doors, guards-and of the insubstantial, haiba sort, which caused ordinary petitioners to tremble and lose their words. To provide what he refers to in a section heading as a “Description of the Imams of Yemen,” al-Wasiʿi (1928: 297) quotes an account that makes repeated use of verbs and (p.173) nouns derived from the h-j-b root, which means to “hide,” “conceal,” “make a separation,” and “to veil.” In its various forms the h-j-b root expresses circumstances opposite to muwajaha, which depends on an unobstructed meeting of faces. According to the quoted text, the ideal imam is like one of his subjects in his simple style of life, and he “speaks to them and governs them, without regard to whether [the individual] before him is a noble or a commoner, strong or weak, without creating a barrier (hijjab). He does not delegate matters to ministers or chamberlains (hujjab). … [Such rulers] nei ther keep [others] ou t (yahjibun) nor seclude themselves (yahtajibun).”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_599_YeQasmi] Messick describes the procedure. It appears that both court buildings and judicial residences were legitimate venues for making appeals and negotiating cases in the modern period: 'On the receiving end, in the imam's diwan for example, shakwas were first screened and summarized by secretaries.15 The secretary wrote a brief memo at the top indicating the subject matter and the action sought. The shakwa was then passed before the imam, who would add a quick note of refusal or permission, such as “nothing forbids this,” or return the paper to the secretary to draft a brief order (amr) or a note of transfer to an appropriate official or other person. Transfers often carried a request for investigation or clarification of the complaint, and, if warranted, an order for implementation (lanfidh) or dabt, which entailed some form of arrest, seizure, enforcement, or restraint. One of the possible officials to whom a shakwa initially presented to an imam or a local governor might be transferred was the shariʽa judge of the appropriate jurisdiction. The hakim too received shakwas directly, and also transferred them to others. The ideal administrator was one who not only was accessible, in the sense of receiving people's shakwas, but who responded to them quickly and decisively. For officials of all levels, reading and responding to the shakwa traffic was one of the principal tasks of day-to-day government.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_600_YeQasmi] 'For the judge, the shariʽa court itself, the mahkama shariʽa, entailed a specialized form of muwajaha. The required openness of this event was defined in manual chapters on procedure. Court should be held in a well-known and central public place, while the rule against posting a doorman (hajib, from the h-j-b root) addressed a concern for unimpeded direct access. Reacting to the tumult of bodies crowding a contemporary (mid-1970s) Ibb courtroom and pressing forward to gain the attention of an old judge, his teenage son suggested that it would be desirable to create order by placing guards at the door to let disputants in one at a time, or in pairs. His father retorted sharply that (p.175) a guard at the door led inexorably to people's being denied access and, as a consequence, being denied justice. Years after the opening of official courtrooms, older judges could still be encountered listening to disputants sitting outside at curbside or at the doorsteps of their residences before or after lunch. But the direction of new legislation concerned with judicial procedure is toward more “ordered” sessions, with access to the judge regulated by a doorrnan.16 and also-diametrically opposite to the open-door format-private interviews, conducted under newly instituted prosecutorial auspices (Messick 1983b),17 and closed sessions in certain circumstances. A final separation of house and court was mandated by the “Judicial Authority” legislation of 1979 (Art. 17): “Sessions are to be held in the court building, in specially designated rooms.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_601_YeQasmi] This might indicate that dedicated court buildings, distinct from judicial residences, were absent prior to the modern and Ottoman periods. This remains in need of further confirmation, but it appears that this is borne out by his description of judges dealing with complaints: 'A shakwa presented to a judge, or transferred to him, is a way of bringing a matter to his attention for the first time. In giving attention to a shakwa, however, a judge is not engaging the process of adjudication. The shakwa represents only a petition by a single party, and this is different from a claim (daʿwa) with which a formal proceeding opens. A da wa involves two parties, one who makes the daʿwa and a second who is also present and hears the daʿwa and then responds to it, in an ijaba. The presentation of a shakwa is intended only to get the judge to issue a summons to the second party. If the shakwa is minimally plausible and the subject matter relevant to his jurisdiction, the judge will dispatch one of his soldier-retainers, a step known as infadh.18 This occurs by means of a note written atop the shakwa by the judge, which says, “Bring so and so to give justice (li-insaf) to the petitioner.” In addition to the task of maintaining order before the judge, the work of delivering summonses is the primary activity of the judge's soldier-retainers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_602_YeQasmi]  'There were thus two distinct types of muwajaha that occurred as the judge sat before his house. The simple and far more numerous first type is the approach by the single party for the purpose of presenting a shakwa; it is the petitioner and the judge who come face-to-face in this instance. The second, more complex type, occurs “between” (bain) two parties and in the presence of the judge. It requires a claimant (muddaʿi), who states the daʿwa, and a defendant (muddoʿ ʾalih), who first hears the daʿwa and then makes an answer, an ijaba. In this instance the parties confront each other and together confront the judge. From the beginning, then, as a matter becomes a case and is adjudicated, a petition is answered by the judge, a claim is answered by the defendant, (p.176) and a claim and a response (followed by evidence or oaths) are together answered by the judge in his ruling (hukm).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_603_YeQasmi] Interpersonal knowledge obtained through non-specialist members of the local community was also important: 'Intended for the circumstances of various times and places, including, for example, those that obtained in his native Syria, al-Nawawi's manual takes into consideration still another possible communicative intervention, a translator.27 Judges in very large cities of the Middle East and elsewhere doubtless could never come to know the population of their jurisdictions well enough to forgo major reliance on the mediations of muzakkis, translators, neighborhood notaries, quarter heads, market and craft officials, experts of various types, sectarian representatives, and so forth. But in Ibb, and perhaps most if not all Yemeni towns, the population was, until recent years, small (e.g., for Ibb, ca. 5,000 in 1900), and the character of the interaction was “face-to-face”; people all “knew” one another in terms of names and social identity, if not on an intimate basis (i.e., zahiran, if not batinan). It was such knowledge, within the community and, potentially, between the judge and the community, that ideally structured a local muwajaha encounter. In recent decades, however, Ibb has expanded rapidly in surface area and population (ca. 17,000 in 1975), and town society is now marked by a rapidly declining degree of mutual “knowledge.” Associated with the spatial and demographic changes, a shift is occurring to a pattern of interaction in which people interact for the first time in the presence of large numbers of townspeople they do not “know.” Associated with this social change is a new state presence, represented by numerous new functionaries, including university graduatejudges, who not only are different in formation and administrative style but who (p.179) remain strangers to the town to the end of their often brief tenures in office.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_604_YeQasmi] 'The circuitry of interpersonal knowledge in a small community such as Ibb carried information about reputation. Originally constituted “before the people” (quddam al-nas), reports concerning reputations circulated thereafter through dense word-of-mouth channels. A collectivity of informal (and potentially formal) witnesses for one another's conduct, the-community was acutely sensitive to deviation from established personal norms. Conduct was evaluated with reference to a frame of known differences of social identity, occupation, personality, and so forth. As with the “mismatches” discussed earlier, it was mainly the nontypical for the type that was remarked upon. Feeding with special enthusiasm upon the novel, gossip nevertheless also confirmed in passing the already known.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_605_YeQasmi] Judges were typically not appointed to their own home districts: 'The Yemeni practice of not appointing judges to their home districts (p.182) is not based on an explicit manual principle, but al-Nawawi's advice to a new appointee to make inquiries about scholars and reputable people implies a posting to an unknown place. The Yemeni appointment rule served the purpose of causing a new judge to start fresh, in a context free, at least initially, of both the demands of extensive family ties and the constraints of prior obligations and events. The paradox here is that while too much intimacy-such as would occur in a native district posting or if a judge attempted to conduct himself like an ordinary citizen-was to be avoided, a substantial degree of close contact was nonetheless essential for acquiring the local knowledge basic to judging.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_606_YeQasmi] Courtroom adjudication and 'customary' forms of dispute resolution co-existed even in the modern period: 'ʿUrf is also procedural. Formal and official shariʽa courts are paralleled in Ibb by an important alternative resolution format of an unofficial and customary nature. While shariʽa court adjudication procedures result in winners and losers, the customary formula is compromise (sulh). Customary compromise represents a foil for the court in a sense that goes beyond the alternative that it represents to a state forum, substantive shariʽa jurisprudence, and formal adjudication. Men gather in the sitting rooms of private houses for this compromise type of settling, and the meeting of faces involved is quite different from that in a public muwajaha. Whereas court procedure is based on extended and frequently damaging verbal confrontations between the adversaries, compromises work through separation and avoidance. Each of the parties is talked to alone; views are aired, and potential solutions are suggested. Mediators motivated by goodwill can cut through the posturing and lying that plague the tribunal. Unlike the cool and narrow effort to focus upon manifest facts (al-zahir) in the judge's court, mediators freely explore issues in breadth and in depth, “studying hearts,” as one put it. It is only when a compromise has been reached that the parties are brought together to seal the agreement. At the session, usually over an afternoon of qat chewing, the matter at hand is not overtly mentioned. The final settlement is effected through writing. If there are last-minute hitches, mediators step out of the room briefly for further words. As the conversation in the room is steered in other directions, final documents are prepared and then unobtrusively passed along to the parties for their signatures. Others present-relatives, friends, and neighbors-add their names as witnesses. In this manner two “faces” meet each other in the presence of assembled men: the genius of sitting-room compromises is that they permit the intact honor of each man to confront the other, without either being put into question.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_607_YeQasmi] 'As venue types, courtroom adjudication and sitting-room compromise represent polar opposites: sharia versus ʿurf in substance, official and public versus unofficial and private in format. There are, in addition, intermediate types, the custornary42 but official dispute-handling (p.185) activi ty of the governor (the mazalim, discussed earlier) and the shariʽa-based but unofficial activities of consensual ruling and judicial arbitration (hukm taradi and tahkim).43 Compromise itself is not an exclusive property of custom and the sitting room, however. The Arhar manual says a judge ought to “urge compromise (sulh)” upon the parties to a dispute.44 A caveat is attached: the urging should occur especially when the correct solution is not apparent to the judge, whereas if the truth is clear, he should encourage a still simpler and, in Yemen, unlikely outcome, forgiveness.45 In the perspective of jurists, compromise is generally permitted insofar as it does not, in the words of a famous hadith, render “legal the illegal, or illegal the legal.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_608_YeQasmi] The strong valuation of availability indicates that courts and trials were accessible beyond elite strata of society, at least in principle.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ non-ruling elite ♣ present ♥</b> See above.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ general population ♣ present ♥</b> See above.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ foreign groups ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ ethnic groups ♣ ♥</b><b>Accessibility of Trials</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ ruling elite ♣ present ♥</b> Messick describes the post-Ottoman imamate, but some his comments seems to hold true for the Qasimid imams as well. This remains in need of confirmation. Political leadership and judicial duties overlapped in the person of the imam, but sharia courts and judges were also present: 'Hakim, the standard term for “judge” (qadi was also used), as in hakim sharʿi or “shariʽa judge,” had another sense, which meant “ruler,” as in the identification of Imam Yahya as hakim al-yaman, “ruler of Yemen.?”3 In this domain of overlapping terminology a verb from the same h-k-m root, followed by bainahum (lit. “between them”) can mean “he governed” when used of an imam or, beyond the sphere of the state, ofan important rural shaykh, and “he adjudicated their case” (p.169) when used in reference to a judge. One is reminded of a similar double resonance of the English word “court,” held by both kings and judges. While the categories judge and imam are not to be confused, it is also true that the activity of governing in Yemen was in general very much devoted to settling disputes, with only a specialized part of this activity being handled by the shariʽa court variety of hakim.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_609_YeQasmi] Messick describes the interaction of imams, judges and muftis with the public: 'To Yemenis, judges in this type of open setting, accessible to the public, appeared in a posture known as muwajaha, from wajh meaning “face,” the quintessential face-to-face encounter of official public life (see fig. 9). Muwajaha was also the format in which the mufti received afternoon fatwa seekers, and the same sort of generic activity was characteristic as well of both ruling imams and local governors. Direct accessibility, based on a public presence that enabled personal encounters and personal solutions to problems, was a fundamental value of the old administrative style.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_610_YeQasmi] 'Like Saint Louis under his oak at Vincennes, Imam Yahya was well known for his daily practice of making himself available to his subjects. The tradition went back more than a millennium to the conduct of the first Zaidi imam in Yemen, al-Hadi.4 and the scene was nearly identical to that enacted on the local level by judges in twentieth-century Ibb. “Every morning,” the historian al-Wasiʿi 1928: 295-96) writes, “the Imam himself sat in the courtyard of his palace, Dar al-Saʿada, to hear for himself people's petitions.” “Himself” is repeated to emphasize the physical presence of the imam. “The decrepit, the weak (datif), women, children, the long-suffering came to him [and he met them with] a warm, sympathetic, solicitous and unpretentious countenance. This [activity] was the centerpiece of his desire to extend justice and equity.”5 Attentiveness to the needs and problems of the downtrodden and the people oflower status was a sign ofjust government in general6 and a value in judicial procedure in particular, as expressed in the manual principle of giving precedence to the claim of the “weak.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_611_YeQasmi] 'At noon, followed by a few soldier-retainers and a crowd of people, the imam would walk to the mosque, continuing to hear petitions even as he washed in preparation for prayer. After lunch, like the local mufti, judges, and governor in Ibb, the imam would appear in his diwan, the semipublic sitting room in his own palace-residence. There his secretaries would gather around him to engage in reading and responding to petitions that had arrived from around the country. Again, in a manner characterized by personal involvement with each and every (p.170) case, he would “attend to the papers one by one, [including] the simple and the momentous.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_612_YeQasmi] Direct appeals to the relevant judicial officials were important: 'Central to the muwajaha format was the notion of responsiveness. An “official,” al-masʾul, was literally “the one asked.” What was sought from an imam or a governor, a mufti or a judge, was an “answer” (a jawab). In the case of the mufti, a query was posed and the answer was the fatwa. For the other three dispute-handling public officials, the imam in the capital and the governor and the judge on the provincial level, the approach was made in the form of a complaint or petition, known as a shakwa. Historically, shakwas were the general means by which individuals initiated actions in which they wanted to involve the state.9 Whether these were individual-state matters (employment, state credit, charity disbursement, tax matters) or individual-individual ones (p.171) (disputes of all sorts) pursued through the state, the shakwa always represented the opening move.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_613_YeQasmi] 'The basic procedure for obtaining justice, for finding relief from injustice (zulm), through the state, was thus a direct appeal to an official, one ofwhorn was the shariʽa judge. In his well-known Hadith commentary al-Nawawi summarizes the pattern as follows: “The wronged person can seek relief from the sultan and the judge, and other appointed officials, asking for redress from the offending person, saying ‘So and so has wronged me,’ or ‘So and so did this or that to me’” (quoted in al-Shawkani A.H. 1394: 14). The vocabulary of zulm-the mazlum (wronged person), zalim (offending person), ralama (to wrong), tarallum (to complain or seek relief)-is precisely that utilized in shakwas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_614_YeQasmi] On the local level, governors and judges co-existed with sometimes over-lapping judicial duties: 'In many Muslim states, from an early date, mazalim jurisdictions, as they became known (from the same z-l-m root), amounted to alternate or superior forums for handling disputes.12 The existence of such competing forums partly contradicted the supposedly universal jurisdictional sweep of the shariʽa court, especially if matters contained within the purview of the shariʽa were as a consequence not dealt with by the shariʽa judge. In imamic Yemen, this contradiction worked a bit differently than in the typical Sunni state, headed by a sultan or a king. Condensed in the identity of the imam were both a sultan's temporal capacity to handle grievances such as salary arrears, petitions for transfer of position, or complaints about an official's conduct, and the full shariʽa capacity of the ultimate judge (and mufti) in the land. While there was for this reason no open contradiction or separation of powers at the apex of the imamic systern of rule, at the local level of the governorates there opened up two distinct positions: the shariʽa judge (hakim) and the governor inaʾib, ʿamil i. These separate delegations (wilaya) of capacity, undivided in the identity of the imam, meant that dispute settlement on the level of the provincial town involved a division of labor between the hakim's capacity to handle shariʽa matters (p.172) and the governor's capacity to handle problems defined as being of another sort-roughly, the maralim jurisidiction formula.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_615_YeQasmi] Personal presence was valued: 'Proper conduct of the muwajaha style of government depended on the elimination and avoidance of barriers between ruler and ruled. The barriers at issue were both physical-walls, closed doors, guards-and of the insubstantial, haiba sort, which caused ordinary petitioners to tremble and lose their words. To provide what he refers to in a section heading as a “Description of the Imams of Yemen,” al-Wasiʿi (1928: 297) quotes an account that makes repeated use of verbs and (p.173) nouns derived from the h-j-b root, which means to “hide,” “conceal,” “make a separation,” and “to veil.” In its various forms the h-j-b root expresses circumstances opposite to muwajaha, which depends on an unobstructed meeting of faces. According to the quoted text, the ideal imam is like one of his subjects in his simple style of life, and he “speaks to them and governs them, without regard to whether [the individual] before him is a noble or a commoner, strong or weak, without creating a barrier (hijjab). He does not delegate matters to ministers or chamberlains (hujjab). … [Such rulers] nei ther keep [others] ou t (yahjibun) nor seclude themselves (yahtajibun).”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_616_YeQasmi] Messick describes the procedure. It appears that both court buildings and judicial residences were legitimate venues for making appeals and negotiating cases in the modern period: 'On the receiving end, in the imam's diwan for example, shakwas were first screened and summarized by secretaries.15 The secretary wrote a brief memo at the top indicating the subject matter and the action sought. The shakwa was then passed before the imam, who would add a quick note of refusal or permission, such as “nothing forbids this,” or return the paper to the secretary to draft a brief order (amr) or a note of transfer to an appropriate official or other person. Transfers often carried a request for investigation or clarification of the complaint, and, if warranted, an order for implementation (lanfidh) or dabt, which entailed some form of arrest, seizure, enforcement, or restraint. One of the possible officials to whom a shakwa initially presented to an imam or a local governor might be transferred was the shariʽa judge of the appropriate jurisdiction. The hakim too received shakwas directly, and also transferred them to others. The ideal administrator was one who not only was accessible, in the sense of receiving people's shakwas, but who responded to them quickly and decisively. For officials of all levels, reading and responding to the shakwa traffic was one of the principal tasks of day-to-day government.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_617_YeQasmi] 'For the judge, the shariʽa court itself, the mahkama shariʽa, entailed a specialized form of muwajaha. The required openness of this event was defined in manual chapters on procedure. Court should be held in a well-known and central public place, while the rule against posting a doorman (hajib, from the h-j-b root) addressed a concern for unimpeded direct access. Reacting to the tumult of bodies crowding a contemporary (mid-1970s) Ibb courtroom and pressing forward to gain the attention of an old judge, his teenage son suggested that it would be desirable to create order by placing guards at the door to let disputants in one at a time, or in pairs. His father retorted sharply that (p.175) a guard at the door led inexorably to people's being denied access and, as a consequence, being denied justice. Years after the opening of official courtrooms, older judges could still be encountered listening to disputants sitting outside at curbside or at the doorsteps of their residences before or after lunch. But the direction of new legislation concerned with judicial procedure is toward more “ordered” sessions, with access to the judge regulated by a doorrnan.16 and also-diametrically opposite to the open-door format-private interviews, conducted under newly instituted prosecutorial auspices (Messick 1983b),17 and closed sessions in certain circumstances. A final separation of house and court was mandated by the “Judicial Authority” legislation of 1979 (Art. 17): “Sessions are to be held in the court building, in specially designated rooms.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_618_YeQasmi] This might indicate that dedicated court buildings, distinct from judicial residences, were absent prior to the modern and Ottoman periods. This remains in need of further confirmation, but it appears that this is borne out by his description of judges dealing with complaints: 'A shakwa presented to a judge, or transferred to him, is a way of bringing a matter to his attention for the first time. In giving attention to a shakwa, however, a judge is not engaging the process of adjudication. The shakwa represents only a petition by a single party, and this is different from a claim (daʿwa) with which a formal proceeding opens. A da wa involves two parties, one who makes the daʿwa and a second who is also present and hears the daʿwa and then responds to it, in an ijaba. The presentation of a shakwa is intended only to get the judge to issue a summons to the second party. If the shakwa is minimally plausible and the subject matter relevant to his jurisdiction, the judge will dispatch one of his soldier-retainers, a step known as infadh.18 This occurs by means of a note written atop the shakwa by the judge, which says, “Bring so and so to give justice (li-insaf) to the petitioner.” In addition to the task of maintaining order before the judge, the work of delivering summonses is the primary activity of the judge's soldier-retainers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_619_YeQasmi]  'There were thus two distinct types of muwajaha that occurred as the judge sat before his house. The simple and far more numerous first type is the approach by the single party for the purpose of presenting a shakwa; it is the petitioner and the judge who come face-to-face in this instance. The second, more complex type, occurs “between” (bain) two parties and in the presence of the judge. It requires a claimant (muddaʿi), who states the daʿwa, and a defendant (muddoʿ ʾalih), who first hears the daʿwa and then makes an answer, an ijaba. In this instance the parties confront each other and together confront the judge. From the beginning, then, as a matter becomes a case and is adjudicated, a petition is answered by the judge, a claim is answered by the defendant, (p.176) and a claim and a response (followed by evidence or oaths) are together answered by the judge in his ruling (hukm).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_620_YeQasmi] Interpersonal knowledge obtained through non-specialist members of the local community was also important: 'Intended for the circumstances of various times and places, including, for example, those that obtained in his native Syria, al-Nawawi's manual takes into consideration still another possible communicative intervention, a translator.27 Judges in very large cities of the Middle East and elsewhere doubtless could never come to know the population of their jurisdictions well enough to forgo major reliance on the mediations of muzakkis, translators, neighborhood notaries, quarter heads, market and craft officials, experts of various types, sectarian representatives, and so forth.

Informal tribal law was important and remained so even in the 19th and 20th centuries: 'A strict and complex code of honor based on tribal values governs behavior among groups and proper decorum between the sexes, including veiling of women in urban or northern areas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_626_YeQasmi] 'The cultural concept of honor also regulates the handling of disputes, which depends on confirming significant kinship ties.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_627_YeQasmi] 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_628_YeQasmi] But Islamic legal scholarship has a long history in Yemen as a guarantor of status and in the settling of disputes: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_629_YeQasmi] Judges were encouraged to be attentive to local custom in the adjudication of disputes: 'In the most general sense, the ʿurf of a place (ʿuif al-balad) refers to the established usages in all the domains of social life. An initial issue is the level of locale (balad) referred to. It might be possible to speak, for example, of the ʿ urf of Yemen, but what is usually highlighted by the term is regional difference, variation. The ʿ urf of a place could be said to be similar to (or even include) special linguistic usage, with ʿ urf differing frorn locale to locale in much the same way regional dialects shade one into the other. Measures are a good example: each highland region had its own terminology of particular linear and volume units. A judge posted to Ibb from somewhere in Upper Yemen had to learn the local terms and the measures indicated. I t was not a difference of yards and meters, however; to the extent that the judge knew something of units of land and quantities of grain in his home district he would find similar types of measurement categories used in Ibb.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_630_YeQasmi] 'A judge had to concern himself mainly with ʿurf that was relevant to the applied shariʽa, Inasmuch as the shariʽa is general or summary in its provisions, there are two basic ways it could be extended or given necessary detail. One is through the activities of interpretation, which “fill in gaps” in the shariʽaʾs conceptual structure as needed. The other is by reliance on the existing detailed structures of local usage, or turf, a patchwork backdrop of practices that showed through the gaps in the shariʽa fabric. Although “custom” as an integrated and elaborated (p.183) category of law was never elevated to a position of theoretical prominence by jurists, a widely accepted judicial attitude toward such usage is summarized in a simple formula cited by Ibb judge al-Haddad: “If no relevant [shariʽa] text is found, then that which is known customarily is taken to be a binding condition” (idh lam yujad nassan fa-l-ma ʿruf ʿurfan ka-l-rnashrut shartan).36 This view speaks not to situations of conflict between shariʽa and ʿurf, which are not tolerated by jurists, but to areas of substantive concern about which the shariʽa is silent.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_631_YeQasmi] 'There are numerous substantive areas in the manuals where the judge is specifically directed to supply necessary detail by reference to prevailing custom.37 Often this is by means of the expressions “ʿurf” or “ʿurf al-balad,” but the same sense obtains in a number of alternative terms, used in the manuals and in Ibb practice, such as al-maruf (“the known”), al-mashhur (“the known”), al-ada (“custom”-as in “Adat Law” in Southeast Asia), al-muʿtad (“the customary”). Still other terms reveal an openness to contextual grounding in the specifics of many shariʾa provisions. Mithl, meaning “like” or “similar,” is often used to this end. The amount of money that must be paid to the wife by the husband as mahr is not set in the manuals; instead the amount is characterized as mahr al-mithl, that is, a sum to be determined according to what is locally appropriate for women of equivalent status. Another example, mentioned earlier, concerns the “seriousness” (muruʾa) of a potential witness, which is to be evaluated relative to the standard of seriousness current in the local community, that is, muruʾat al-mithl.38 Many monetary and other questions are to be determined by reference to similar local circumstances of “time and place,” a frequently encountered manual formula that rhymes in Arabic (zaman wa makan).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_632_YeQasmi] 'Two specific and relatively bounded varieties of ʿurf that an Ibb judge usually knew something about and occasionally dealt with officially were the custom of the merchants (ʿurf al-tujjar) and “tribal” custom (ʿurf al-qabili). The first is a body of detailed local practices opened up around the core transactional forms of the applied jurisprudence (sale, lease, credit, partnership, agency, etc.). Ibb merchants always tended to handle their disputes informally among themselves rather than appearing in shariʽa tribunals. With advancing commercialization in recent years, this separation was formalized with the appearance of chambers of commerce (with arbitration functions) and, a few years later, commercial courts (established in the three largest townsj.39 The second type of custom concerns rules elaborated mostly (p.184) beyond the physical and conceptual bounds of the shariʽa, although “tribal” practices such as the hajar, an animal sacrifice used to appease abused honor and preceded by a public procession, occurs fairly frequently in Ibb town.40 In some regions, a judge was expected to be conversant with two discourses, to “provide shariʽa rulings in shariʽa matters and customary rulings for customary issues.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_633_YeQasmi] 'ʿUrf is also procedural. Formal and official shariʽa courts are paralleled in Ibb by an important alternative resolution format of an unofficial and customary nature. While shariʽa court adjudication procedures result in winners and losers, the customary formula is compromise (sulh). Customary compromise represents a foil for the court in a sense that goes beyond the alternative that it represents to a state forum, substantive shariʽa jurisprudence, and formal adjudication. Men gather in the sitting rooms of private houses for this compromise type of settling, and the meeting of faces involved is quite different from that in a public muwajaha. Whereas court procedure is based on extended and frequently damaging verbal confrontations between the adversaries, compromises work through separation and avoidance. Each of the parties is talked to alone; views are aired, and potential solutions are suggested. Mediators motivated by goodwill can cut through the posturing and lying that plague the tribunal. Unlike the cool and narrow effort to focus upon manifest facts (al-zahir) in the judge's court, mediators freely explore issues in breadth and in depth, “studying hearts,” as one put it. It is only when a compromise has been reached that the parties are brought together to seal the agreement. At the session, usually over an afternoon of qat chewing, the matter at hand is not overtly mentioned. The final settlement is effected through writing. If there are last-minute hitches, mediators step out of the room briefly for further words. As the conversation in the room is steered in other directions, final documents are prepared and then unobtrusively passed along to the parties for their signatures. Others present-relatives, friends, and neighbors-add their names as witnesses. In this manner two “faces” meet each other in the presence of assembled men: the genius of sitting-room compromises is that they permit the intact honor of each man to confront the other, without either being put into question.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_634_YeQasmi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious judiciary ♣ present ♥</b> Messick describes the post-Ottoman imamate, but some his comments seems to hold true for the Qasimid imams as well. This remains in need of confirmation. Political leadership and judicial duties overlapped in the person of the imam, but sharia courts and judges were also present: 'Hakim, the standard term for “judge” (qadi was also used), as in hakim sharʿi or “shariʽa judge,” had another sense, which meant “ruler,” as in the identification of Imam Yahya as hakim al-yaman, “ruler of Yemen.?”3 In this domain of overlapping terminology a verb from the same h-k-m root, followed by bainahum (lit. “between them”) can mean “he governed” when used of an imam or, beyond the sphere of the state, ofan important rural shaykh, and “he adjudicated their case” (p.169) when used in reference to a judge. One is reminded of a similar double resonance of the English word “court,” held by both kings and judges. While the categories judge and imam are not to be confused, it is also true that the activity of governing in Yemen was in general very much devoted to settling disputes, with only a specialized part of this activity being handled by the shariʽa court variety of hakim.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_635_YeQasmi] Messick describes the interaction of imams, judges and muftis with the public: 'To Yemenis, judges in this type of open setting, accessible to the public, appeared in a posture known as muwajaha, from wajh meaning “face,” the quintessential face-to-face encounter of official public life (see fig. 9). Muwajaha was also the format in which the mufti received afternoon fatwa seekers, and the same sort of generic activity was characteristic as well of both ruling imams and local governors. Direct accessibility, based on a public presence that enabled personal encounters and personal solutions to problems, was a fundamental value of the old administrative style.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_636_YeQasmi] 'Like Saint Louis under his oak at Vincennes, Imam Yahya was well known for his daily practice of making himself available to his subjects. The tradition went back more than a millennium to the conduct of the first Zaidi imam in Yemen, al-Hadi.4 and the scene was nearly identical to that enacted on the local level by judges in twentieth-century Ibb. “Every morning,” the historian al-Wasiʿi 1928: 295-96) writes, “the Imam himself sat in the courtyard of his palace, Dar al-Saʿada, to hear for himself people's petitions.” “Himself” is repeated to emphasize the physical presence of the imam. “The decrepit, the weak (datif), women, children, the long-suffering came to him [and he met them with] a warm, sympathetic, solicitous and unpretentious countenance. This [activity] was the centerpiece of his desire to extend justice and equity.”5 Attentiveness to the needs and problems of the downtrodden and the people oflower status was a sign ofjust government in general6 and a value in judicial procedure in particular, as expressed in the manual principle of giving precedence to the claim of the “weak.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_637_YeQasmi] 'At noon, followed by a few soldier-retainers and a crowd of people, the imam would walk to the mosque, continuing to hear petitions even as he washed in preparation for prayer. After lunch, like the local mufti, judges, and governor in Ibb, the imam would appear in his diwan, the semipublic sitting room in his own palace-residence. There his secretaries would gather around him to engage in reading and responding to petitions that had arrived from around the country. Again, in a manner characterized by personal involvement with each and every (p.170) case, he would “attend to the papers one by one, [including] the simple and the momentous.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_638_YeQasmi] Direct appeals to the relevant judicial officials were important: 'Central to the muwajaha format was the notion of responsiveness. An “official,” al-masʾul, was literally “the one asked.” What was sought from an imam or a governor, a mufti or a judge, was an “answer” (a jawab). In the case of the mufti, a query was posed and the answer was the fatwa. For the other three dispute-handling public officials, the imam in the capital and the governor and the judge on the provincial level, the approach was made in the form of a complaint or petition, known as a shakwa. Historically, shakwas were the general means by which individuals initiated actions in which they wanted to involve the state.9 Whether these were individual-state matters (employment, state credit, charity disbursement, tax matters) or individual-individual ones (p.171) (disputes of all sorts) pursued through the state, the shakwa always represented the opening move.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_639_YeQasmi] 'The basic procedure for obtaining justice, for finding relief from injustice (zulm), through the state, was thus a direct appeal to an official, one ofwhorn was the shariʽa judge. In his well-known Hadith commentary al-Nawawi summarizes the pattern as follows: “The wronged person can seek relief from the sultan and the judge, and other appointed officials, asking for redress from the offending person, saying ‘So and so has wronged me,’ or ‘So and so did this or that to me’” (quoted in al-Shawkani A.H. 1394: 14). The vocabulary of zulm-the mazlum (wronged person), zalim (offending person), ralama (to wrong), tarallum (to complain or seek relief)-is precisely that utilized in shakwas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_640_YeQasmi] On the local level, governors and judges co-existed with sometimes over-lapping judicial duties: 'In many Muslim states, from an early date, mazalim jurisdictions, as they became known (from the same z-l-m root), amounted to alternate or superior forums for handling disputes.12 The existence of such competing forums partly contradicted the supposedly universal jurisdictional sweep of the shariʽa court, especially if matters contained within the purview of the shariʽa were as a consequence not dealt with by the shariʽa judge. In imamic Yemen, this contradiction worked a bit differently than in the typical Sunni state, headed by a sultan or a king. Condensed in the identity of the imam were both a sultan's temporal capacity to handle grievances such as salary arrears, petitions for transfer of position, or complaints about an official's conduct, and the full shariʽa capacity of the ultimate judge (and mufti) in the land. While there was for this reason no open contradiction or separation of powers at the apex of the imamic systern of rule, at the local level of the governorates there opened up two distinct positions: the shariʽa judge (hakim) and the governor inaʾib, ʿamil i. These separate delegations (wilaya) of capacity, undivided in the identity of the imam, meant that dispute settlement on the level of the provincial town involved a division of labor between the hakim's capacity to handle shariʽa matters (p.172) and the governor's capacity to handle problems defined as being of another sort-roughly, the maralim jurisidiction formula.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_641_YeQasmi] Personal presence was valued: 'Proper conduct of the muwajaha style of government depended on the elimination and avoidance of barriers between ruler and ruled. The barriers at issue were both physical-walls, closed doors, guards-and of the insubstantial, haiba sort, which caused ordinary petitioners to tremble and lose their words. To provide what he refers to in a section heading as a “Description of the Imams of Yemen,” al-Wasiʿi (1928: 297) quotes an account that makes repeated use of verbs and (p.173) nouns derived from the h-j-b root, which means to “hide,” “conceal,” “make a separation,” and “to veil.” In its various forms the h-j-b root expresses circumstances opposite to muwajaha, which depends on an unobstructed meeting of faces. According to the quoted text, the ideal imam is like one of his subjects in his simple style of life, and he “speaks to them and governs them, without regard to whether [the individual] before him is a noble or a commoner, strong or weak, without creating a barrier (hijjab). He does not delegate matters to ministers or chamberlains (hujjab). … [Such rulers] nei ther keep [others] ou t (yahjibun) nor seclude themselves (yahtajibun).”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_642_YeQasmi] Messick describes the procedure. It appears that both court buildings and judicial residences were legitimate venues for making appeals and negotiating cases in the modern period: 'On the receiving end, in the imam's diwan for example, shakwas were first screened and summarized by secretaries.15 The secretary wrote a brief memo at the top indicating the subject matter and the action sought. The shakwa was then passed before the imam, who would add a quick note of refusal or permission, such as “nothing forbids this,” or return the paper to the secretary to draft a brief order (amr) or a note of transfer to an appropriate official or other person. Transfers often carried a request for investigation or clarification of the complaint, and, if warranted, an order for implementation (lanfidh) or dabt, which entailed some form of arrest, seizure, enforcement, or restraint. One of the possible officials to whom a shakwa initially presented to an imam or a local governor might be transferred was the shariʽa judge of the appropriate jurisdiction. The hakim too received shakwas directly, and also transferred them to others. The ideal administrator was one who not only was accessible, in the sense of receiving people's shakwas, but who responded to them quickly and decisively. For officials of all levels, reading and responding to the shakwa traffic was one of the principal tasks of day-to-day government.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_643_YeQasmi] 'For the judge, the shariʽa court itself, the mahkama shariʽa, entailed a specialized form of muwajaha. The required openness of this event was defined in manual chapters on procedure. Court should be held in a well-known and central public place, while the rule against posting a doorman (hajib, from the h-j-b root) addressed a concern for unimpeded direct access. Reacting to the tumult of bodies crowding a contemporary (mid-1970s) Ibb courtroom and pressing forward to gain the attention of an old judge, his teenage son suggested that it would be desirable to create order by placing guards at the door to let disputants in one at a time, or in pairs. His father retorted sharply that (p.175) a guard at the door led inexorably to people's being denied access and, as a consequence, being denied justice. Years after the opening of official courtrooms, older judges could still be encountered listening to disputants sitting outside at curbside or at the doorsteps of their residences before or after lunch. But the direction of new legislation concerned with judicial procedure is toward more “ordered” sessions, with access to the judge regulated by a doorrnan.16 and also-diametrically opposite to the open-door format-private interviews, conducted under newly instituted prosecutorial auspices (Messick 1983b),17 and closed sessions in certain circumstances. A final separation of house and court was mandated by the “Judicial Authority” legislation of 1979 (Art. 17): “Sessions are to be held in the court building, in specially designated rooms.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_644_YeQasmi] This might indicate that dedicated court buildings, distinct from judicial residences, were absent prior to the modern and Ottoman periods. This remains in need of further confirmation, but it appears that this is borne out by his description of judges dealing with complaints: 'A shakwa presented to a judge, or transferred to him, is a way of bringing a matter to his attention for the first time. In giving attention to a shakwa, however, a judge is not engaging the process of adjudication. The shakwa represents only a petition by a single party, and this is different from a claim (daʿwa) with which a formal proceeding opens. A da wa involves two parties, one who makes the daʿwa and a second who is also present and hears the daʿwa and then responds to it, in an ijaba. The presentation of a shakwa is intended only to get the judge to issue a summons to the second party. If the shakwa is minimally plausible and the subject matter relevant to his jurisdiction, the judge will dispatch one of his soldier-retainers, a step known as infadh.18 This occurs by means of a note written atop the shakwa by the judge, which says, “Bring so and so to give justice (li-insaf) to the petitioner.” In addition to the task of maintaining order before the judge, the work of delivering summonses is the primary activity of the judge's soldier-retainers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_645_YeQasmi]  'There were thus two distinct types of muwajaha that occurred as the judge sat before his house. The simple and far more numerous first type is the approach by the single party for the purpose of presenting a shakwa; it is the petitioner and the judge who come face-to-face in this instance. The second, more complex type, occurs “between” (bain) two parties and in the presence of the judge. It requires a claimant (muddaʿi), who states the daʿwa, and a defendant (muddoʿ ʾalih), who first hears the daʿwa and then makes an answer, an ijaba. In this instance the parties confront each other and together confront the judge. From the beginning, then, as a matter becomes a case and is adjudicated, a petition is answered by the judge, a claim is answered by the defendant, (p.176) and a claim and a response (followed by evidence or oaths) are together answered by the judge in his ruling (hukm).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_646_YeQasmi] Interpersonal knowledge obtained through non-specialist members of the local community was also important: 'Intended for the circumstances of various times and places, including, for example, those that obtained in his native Syria, al-Nawawi's manual takes into consideration still another possible communicative intervention, a translator.27 Judges in very large cities of the Middle East and elsewhere doubtless could never come to know the population of their jurisdictions well enough to forgo major reliance on the mediations of muzakkis, translators, neighborhood notaries, quarter heads, market and craft officials, experts of various types, sectarian representatives, and so forth. But in Ibb, and perhaps most if not all Yemeni towns, the population was, until recent years, small (e.g., for Ibb, ca. 5,000 in 1900), and the character of the interaction was “face-to-face”; people all “knew” one another in terms of names and social identity, if not on an intimate basis (i.e., zahiran, if not batinan). It was such knowledge, within the community and, potentially, between the judge and the community, that ideally structured a local muwajaha encounter. In recent decades, however, Ibb has expanded rapidly in surface area and population (ca. 17,000 in 1975), and town society is now marked by a rapidly declining degree of mutual “knowledge.” Associated with the spatial and demographic changes, a shift is occurring to a pattern of interaction in which people interact for the first time in the presence of large numbers of townspeople they do not “know.” Associated with this social change is a new state presence, represented by numerous new functionaries, including university graduatejudges, who not only are different in formation and administrative style but who (p.179) remain strangers to the town to the end of their often brief tenures in office.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_647_YeQasmi] 'The circuitry of interpersonal knowledge in a small community such as Ibb carried information about reputation. Originally constituted “before the people” (quddam al-nas), reports concerning reputations circulated thereafter through dense word-of-mouth channels. A collectivity of informal (and potentially formal) witnesses for one another's conduct, the-community was acutely sensitive to deviation from established personal norms. Conduct was evaluated with reference to a frame of known differences of social identity, occupation, personality, and so forth. As with the “mismatches” discussed earlier, it was mainly the nontypical for the type that was remarked upon. Feeding with special enthusiasm upon the novel, gossip nevertheless also confirmed in passing the already known.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_648_YeQasmi] Judges were typically not appointed to their own home districts: 'The Yemeni practice of not appointing judges to their home districts (p.182) is not based on an explicit manual principle, but al-Nawawi's advice to a new appointee to make inquiries about scholars and reputable people implies a posting to an unknown place. The Yemeni appointment rule served the purpose of causing a new judge to start fresh, in a context free, at least initially, of both the demands of extensive family ties and the constraints of prior obligations and events. The paradox here is that while too much intimacy-such as would occur in a native district posting or if a judge attempted to conduct himself like an ordinary citizen-was to be avoided, a substantial degree of close contact was nonetheless essential for acquiring the local knowledge basic to judging.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_649_YeQasmi] Courtroom adjudication and 'customary' forms of dispute resolution co-existed even in the modern period: 'ʿUrf is also procedural. Formal and official shariʽa courts are paralleled in Ibb by an important alternative resolution format of an unofficial and customary nature. While shariʽa court adjudication procedures result in winners and losers, the customary formula is compromise (sulh). Customary compromise represents a foil for the court in a sense that goes beyond the alternative that it represents to a state forum, substantive shariʽa jurisprudence, and formal adjudication. Men gather in the sitting rooms of private houses for this compromise type of settling, and the meeting of faces involved is quite different from that in a public muwajaha. Whereas court procedure is based on extended and frequently damaging verbal confrontations between the adversaries, compromises work through separation and avoidance. Each of the parties is talked to alone; views are aired, and potential solutions are suggested. Mediators motivated by goodwill can cut through the posturing and lying that plague the tribunal. Unlike the cool and narrow effort to focus upon manifest facts (al-zahir) in the judge's court, mediators freely explore issues in breadth and in depth, “studying hearts,” as one put it.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_650_YeQasmi] 'As venue types, courtroom adjudication and sitting-room compromise represent polar opposites: sharia versus ʿurf in substance, official and public versus unofficial and private in format. There are, in addition, intermediate types, the custornary42 but official dispute-handling (p.185) activi ty of the governor (the mazalim, discussed earlier) and the shariʽa-based but unofficial activities of consensual ruling and judicial arbitration (hukm taradi and tahkim).43 Compromise itself is not an exclusive property of custom and the sitting room, however. The Arhar manual says a judge ought to “urge compromise (sulh)” upon the parties to a dispute.44 A caveat is attached: the urging should occur especially when the correct solution is not apparent to the judge, whereas if the truth is clear, he should encourage a still simpler and, in Yemen, unlikely outcome, forgiveness.45 In the perspective of jurists, compromise is generally permitted insofar as it does not, in the words of a famous hadith, render “legal the illegal, or illegal the legal.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_651_YeQasmi]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Property_Rights">Property Rights</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=YeQasmi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=58" title="Edit section: Property Rights">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ present ♥</b> The following material was largely imported from the Ottoman- and modern-period data sheets, but some of it may be applicable to the Qasimid period as well. Land-owning tribal lineages were important: 'In the northern highlands, tribal lineages are based on claims of descent from a named male (patronymic) ancestor. More characteristic of social organization in the southern and coastal regions are smaller alliances and/or greater association with others residing in the same vicinity.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_652_YeQasmi] 'Yemenis recognize the concept of “closeness” to describe desired relationships through marriage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_653_YeQasmi] 'Landownership is concentrated within the dominant patrilineages, the result both of inheritance practices and marital strategies. Under Islamic rules, a woman's inheritance is only half that of her brother. In Yemen, women often do not renounce their claims of ownership. Thus the ideal marriage between patrilateral cousins would ensure that land remains within the patrilineage. Similarly, marriage to an outsider encourages the renunciation of claims to land that is too far away to farm.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_654_YeQasmi] But it appears that private property also existed: 'Farmers either own their plots, which tend to be small, or they work as shareholders. No stigma is attached to nonlandowners unless one is a member of a group that, in the past, was not permitted to buy land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_655_YeQasmi] Many important shaykhly families rose to prominence in the Qasimid period, partly due to their military support for anti-Ottoman campaigns pursued by the imams (see above). Shaykhs relied on revenue from landholdings. Some of these were tribal, but others were outside tribal territory: 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_656_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_657_YeQasmi] 'Tribal possessions in the west and Lower Yemen show up in the histories only as reefs that sometimes break the surface of events, but they are of obvious importance. They are the only substantial source of agricultural surplus. The territory of the tribes themselves, by contrast, is semi-arid and may just produce enough to live on (we shall say more of this in Chapter 8), but would seldom produce much more. To take an obvious example, until the last decade or so, tribesmen on the plateau used often to buy in draft oxen or milch cows from the west once a year and resell them at a serious loss for lack of fodder to support them until the following harvest. Even grain is often scarce on the arid plateau. The men who could provide much wealth beyond this were the tribal leaders who in the histories appear as war-lords.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_663_YeQasmi] 'Yemenis recognize the concept of “closeness” to describe desired relationships through marriage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_664_YeQasmi] Accordingly, arranged marriages and endogamy were the norm: 'Marriages are almost always arranged and frequently are undertaken at a young age. Although the opinion of a potential bride or groom might be solicited on the issue, the final decision on marriage belongs with the head of the household. As in many parts of the Islamic world, endogamy (the practice of marrying someone from within one’s own kin group) is common, the preferred marriage being with a paternal first cousin of the opposite gender. The practice of mahr (bride-price, given by the father of the groom) is a usual part of the marriage ceremony. Divorce is not common, but neither is there a stigma attached to it. Men may have as many as four wives at the same time, though in practice it is rare for a man to take more than one wife.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_665_YeQasmi] While polygyny was legal in principle, monogamy was the norm for most: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women. Customarily, wives (through fathers or brothers) must remunerate their husbands if they wish to terminate the marriage. Legally, fathers' rights to the children after divorce supersede those of mothers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_666_YeQasmi] The basic socio-economic unit was the extended family: 'Yemen shares in many of the customs and lifeways that are found in other parts of the Arab world. Culture is intensely patriarchal, and households usually consist of an extended family living in a single domicile or family compound. The head of the family is the eldest male, who makes all significant decisions for the family and its members. Women play a secondary role in running the household and raising the children and, in rural areas, helping to work the family farm. Though nearly one-fourth of Yemeni women obtain work outside the home, a woman traditionally earns most of her social status through bearing children, particularly males. The birth of a male child is considered one of the most important social events in Yemeni society and is followed almost immediately by a circumcision ceremony. Though prohibited by law in 2001, female genital cutting still occurs, taking place primarily in private and varying significantly by region.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_667_YeQasmi] 'Women preside over the work of the household, which may be comprised of blood relatives, neighbors, and members of client or servant groups in families of high social status.

Kinship was organized in land-owning patrilineages: 'In the northern highlands, tribal lineages are based on claims of descent from a named male (patronymic) ancestor. More characteristic of social organization in the southern and coastal regions are smaller alliances and/or greater association with others residing in the same vicinity.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_669_YeQasmi] 'Yemenis recognize the concept of “closeness” to describe desired relationships through marriage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_670_YeQasmi] 'Landownership is concentrated within the dominant patrilineages, the result both of inheritance practices and marital strategies. Under Islamic rules, a woman's inheritance is only half that of her brother. In Yemen, women often do not renounce their claims of ownership. Thus the ideal marriage between patrilateral cousins would ensure that land remains within the patrilineage. Similarly, marriage to an outsider encourages the renunciation of claims to land that is too far away to farm.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_671_YeQasmi] Patriarchal values were important: 'Yemen shares in many of the customs and lifeways that are found in other parts of the Arab world. Culture is intensely patriarchal, and households usually consist of an extended family living in a single domicile or family compound.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_674_YeQasmi] Veiling was common in the North: 'The traditional nature of Yemeni society is reflected in choices of attire, though the native dress of Yemen differs somewhat from that found in other conservative parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Men sometimes wear the full-length, loose-fitting thawb-frequently with a jacket over it-but more often the traditional fūṭah, a saronglike wraparound kilt, is worn with a shirt. The turban is a common type of head covering, and a finely woven bamboo hat (shaped somewhat like a fez) called a kofiya (or kofia) is a more formal choice of headgear. There are various forms of dress for women, depending on the social role a woman plays and where she lives. In North Yemen, women in cities and towns wore the sharsaf, a black skirt, scarf, and veil ensemble that covers the entire body. In South Yemen, the regime that succeeded the British after 1967 vigorously opposed this women’s dress code, and this opposition prevailed especially in the towns and cities. In the countryside, clothing for women tends to be somewhat more utilitarian and may consist of a dress or robe that provides for a greater range of movement and under which, in some parts of Yemen, it is not uncommon for a woman to wear a pair of loose slacks known as a sirwāl. Also in the countryside, a woman’s face may or may not be covered, and dresses are sometimes sewn from brightly coloured fabric. Working women frequently wear a broad-brimmed straw hat (dhola) to ward off the sun.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_675_YeQasmi] Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Women preside over the work of the household, which may be comprised of blood relatives, neighbors, and members of client or servant groups in families of high social status. Women are valued members of the household unit as agricultural producers and are also crucial to the maintenance of the Yemeni ideal of domestic hospitality.'

Ascribed status determined membership in patrilineages; the same was true of sayyid, scholar and servant groups: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege-especially through marriage and education-to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as “deficient,” either because they provided a service or craft-such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering-that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean “cultivators,” and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_677_YeQasmi] 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_678_YeQasmi] Tribal affiliation was an important social identifier: 'Among Arab groups, tribal affiliation is another deep-seated component of social identity. Some tribal confederations have histories spanning more than two millennia. These affiliations continue to serve as a key basis for political and social organization throughout the country, although the postindependence governments of both South Yemen and, to a lesser extent, North Yemen set out to eradicate what then were considered reactionary cultural institutions. Although efforts toward detribalization were at least in part effective, subsequent events indicated that such identifications were still socially, economically, and politically relevant.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_679_YeQasmi] 'Yemeni society is tribally based, and trust and assurance most often are measured by degree of consanguinity. Families are very close and are the focus of the individual’s primary devotion; one’s second allegiance is to the tribe, an extended family unit that ordinarily traces its ties to a common eponymous ancestor. In rural Yemen, state authority is weak, and disputes between tribes are frequently solved through violence. The art of the feud is still quite real, and, as a consequence, Yemen is a gun culture. Virtually every household has at least one weapon, and men and boys often carry firearms in public. Even when not carrying a pistol or a rifle, most Yemeni males-particularly those belonging to a rural tribe-will carry a dagger, the traditional janbiyyah (or jambiyyah), a short, broad, curved blade sheathed on a belt worn across the abdomen and serving as a signal of one’s status within social and tribal hierarchies.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_680_YeQasmi] 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state.

Islam is the state religion, and the Sunni branch of Islam, represented by the Shāfiʿī school, predominates. The Shīʿite minority consists of the Zaydī school, which has long been politically dominant in the mountainous highlands of the north, and the Ismāʿīlīs, now a relatively small group found in the Haraz region of northern Yemen and in Jabal Manakhah, the mountainous area west of Sanaa.

Furthermore, Jews were violently persecuted after the emergence of a Messianic movement. The codebook does not currently provide a category for status discrimination based on religion, but religion and ethnicity could be considered to intersect in the case of the Yemeni Jewish community. Tobi provides a historical description of repressive measures directed at Jews: 'In 1629 power in San'a was retaken by the native populalion after the Turks were driven out by the sons of the Zaydi Imam al-Qasim, who had firsl risen in revolt against them at the end of the previous century. While the Jews did not live at ease under Turkish rule, especially in its last years, as attested by Shalom Shabazi in his commentary to the Pentateuch liemdat Yamim,7 their lot deteriorated under the Zaydi yoke. The latter were religious fanatics and far stricter than the Sunni Ottomans (of the Hanafi school) in their treatment of Jews as ahl aidhimmah. 8 But to the religious facet was added the national facet, for the new Zaydi rulers accused the Jews of siding with the infidel Turks.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_691_YeQasmi] 'Religious ardour apparently intensified in particular under al-Qasim's son, the Imam Ism3'il al-Mutawakkil, who took power in 1644 and who was zealously religious. 'o Despite all the foregoing, there is no evidence whatever in the Jewish sources that at a certain date prior to the events associated with Shabbetay Zevi in 1667 acts of repression were carried out against the Jews of Yemen. On the other hand, according to various sources the latter expected the coming of the Messiah in the course of the seventeenth century, from the year 1619 on. This was connected with the appearance of two comets that year, according to Yisrael HaKohen of Qubayrah, the city of the priests in the Shar'ab province in southern Yemen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_692_YeQasmi] 'In the years immediately following 1619 the Jews of Yemen encountered great distress in the form of apostasy and incarceration and tonure at the hands of the Turkish rulers, worsened by the starvation resuhing from this and from a plague of locusts. Among the casualties were Yosef ben Avigad, Shabazi's father, and members of his family, as he relates in the sequel to the account of the comets in 1619. These harsh events were perceived as the birth-pangs preceding the advent of the Messiah, as indicated by the writing of zakharyah Ha-Zidoni, who in 1626 (1937 of the SE) expected the arrival of the Messiah in 1940 of the SE ("'In the year 1940 You shall accomplish vengeance") (a pun in Hebrew on the number of the year and the word for vengeance). That year was 1629, the year in which the Turks were driven out of San'a by the sons of al-Qasim, the Imam who rebelled against the foreign yoke.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_693_YeQasmi] 'The first information on Shabbetay Zevi reached Yemen very late, in 1666,30 when the Sabbatean movement was at its height and close to the time of the apocalypse expected that year.31 But it is noteworthy that at that time the advent of the Messiah was expected not only on the basis of this information and the omen of the two comets of 1619, since which time eighty years had not yet passed (see above), but also on the basis of another comet that had appeared in 1665. The only intimation of this is in one of the manuscripts of Shabazi's ll.emdat Yamim, in which the following appendage is found after the above account of the 1619 comelS: "In the year 1976 of Lht: SE a star arose before it like a flame and described a circle until it returned behind it; perhaps this is the star of the Messiah."' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_694_YeQasmi] 'Following the impression made by these events, but without any connection to&nbsp;!.hem, one year later-I 666--letters reached Yemen from Safed and Egypt. apparently Alexandria, telling of the approach of the end of days and of the Messiah Shabbetay Zevi.J ) Some of the letters from Egypt reached the heads of the San'a community-Yihye Ha-Levi, who was head of the court of justice at San'a, and Siayman alNaqqash, the leader of the community. h is not stated explicitly that they were sent to them, and it seems that they were handed over to them by Yemeni Jews. Many of the Jews of Yemen had been led to believe in the messianism of Shabbetay Zevi and the prophecy of Nathan Ha' Azzati, who are the only two figures of the Sabbatean movement to whom reference is made in the letters of the Yemeni sages, even though the heads of the community, in San'a at least, rejected the rumours of redemption:'4 Like Jewish communities outside Yemen, the excitement caused by the tales of Shabbetay Zevi resulted in the occurrence of soothsaying among the Jews in San'a and the neighbouring communities, and also in the communities of the south_ The soothsayers (even including some women), called "heralds" in the sources,35 conducted propaganda on behalf of Shabbetay Zevi and encouraged the Jews to perfonn purification rites and mortification for the coming of the Messiah: it was forbidden to eat meat other than roasted, to drink wine even on Passover eve, to shave the hair of the women's heads, and to engage in sexual intercourse; food was to be dipped in dust and ashes and not in salt, etc. These customs were elaborated by the Sahbateans in Yemen of their own accord. although they had read about the act of purification and mortification in the letters promoting the movement that had reached Vemen from abroad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_695_YeQasmi] 'The Muslims in Yemen oppressed and humiliated the Jews, for which the author appeals to God thus: "Restore us against the tribula· tion and the torture and the humiliations that we have encountered in this exile" (p. 135). It seems that the oppression intensified after the Turks withdrew from Yemen in the 1630s. in particular under the rule of the zealous Imam al·Mut3wakkil Isma'il who ascended the throne in 1644: "Israel has borne several decrees and oppression and a large lax every month and all the days since the year DROR" (-541011650) (p.116). The straitened circumstances of the Yemeni ex.ile also become clear from the interpretation of the verse in Psalms 70:20: "In our exile we suffer from three calamities, the first is persecutions, wandering and slavery; the second is agony, poverty and humiliation; the third is war, abuse and famine" (p, 136), Moreover, from the author's vision of the future status of the Jews of Yemen following redemption something may be learned of their humiliation and resentment stemming from the special ta:&lt; they had to pay for protection by the Muslim ruler: "When the Messiah from the tribe of Ephrayim will appear [.,,] [in the year 5426 [1666J the [Arab] king [...] who was wandering in the desert [...] will distribule letters all over his kingdom 10 enhance the Jews [",] hoping to find reSI and peace and ease to his nation of the known nalion" (the Jews, p, 110), "The Lord will send a spirit in the tongue of every king and governor to announce in the markets and in the streets, saying: Peace. peace for Israel, they shall not pay any more mindah, bela and halakh06 (p. 138).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_696_YeQasmi] 'Elsewhere in the work it transpires that in fact during the rule of al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, cases of apostasy mulliplied under threat of persecution and by decree: these are the birth pangs of the Messiah and a hidden means of discovering if indeed there is complete repentance that will justify redemption (pp. 114-115).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_697_YeQasmi] 'We have observed above that the belief in Shabbetay Zevi in Yemen propagated mainly among the ordinary folk, while the leaders of the San'a community at least, the President Naqqash and the head of the rabbinical court Yihye Ha-Levi, were skeptical about i1.68 As we shall see below, these reservations on the part of these two, and apparently of other leaders in the San'a and other communities, are what saved them from the unnatural death that was the lot of Siayman Jamal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_698_YeQasmi] 'A contemporary Yemeni Muslim writer, 'Abd Allah ibn'Ali ibn al· Wazir, was the author of Iibtiq al-liulwti wa-Jihtif ai-Man wa·l-Salwa. Relating to the year 1077 of the Hijrah (beginning 4 July 1666), he sets out extremely important details on the messianic activity in Yemen that year.69 He states that it began in the month Rajab 1077 of the Hijrah, that is, January 1667. Presumably some time passed, at least several months, between the actual start of messianic activity in Yemen and the moment when the Muslims began to take note of it. The Muslim chronicle states, and this is borne out by what we know from the Hebrew sources, that the Jews sold their possessions cheaply and made preparations for their ascent to the Land of Israel, as the Messiah had been revealed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_699_YeQasmi] 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_700_YeQasmi] 'According to ibn al-Wazir, the stonn abated and the Imam took no funher steps against the Jews. But the Jews themselves, that is, those who held the messianic belief. exploited this time of calm and continued their messianic activity not only in secret but openly, There is no doubt that the official leaders of the San'a community did not participate, except for a certain group headed by one of its sages. The Muslim chronicler relates that in the course of a wine-drinking feast a member of this group became intoxicated and his companions dressed him in the finest garments. This may have been an indication of the messianic aspirations of that individual, as we shall see below. In any event, this man climbed up to the largest fortress of San'a, situated in the eastern outskirts of the city, and attempted to ascend to the throne and the canopy in the fortress, that is, to become ruler of the Muslims. He even made the outspoken demand that the Muslim commanders and soldiers in the fortress place themselves under his command. But instead the latter arrested the man and threw him into the Bustan prison in the city. The Imam was infonned of what had transpired. and he ordered the prisoner to be taken out and executed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_701_YeQasmi] 'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_702_YeQasmi] 'The leaders of the Jewish communities were arrested and tortured in several prisons, and the sentence of death hovered over lhem. As usual in cases of this kind in Yemen, Jews so sentenced were offered their lives in return for conversion to Islam;84 but the offer was rejected.1l.S Naqqash, the nagid of the San'a community, was exiled to Qamaran86 in the Red Sea, a mostly deserted island populated by a few fishermen and a handful of villagers who made their living by pearl diving87 and which was used as a prison island for political offenders.88 He remained imprisoned and shackled for two years and only lhen was he released and returned to San'a.89 During the Mawza' exile, in 1679, he was still officiating as the nagid of the San'a community.90 It appears that his release was due to the fact that like other leaders of the San'a and other communities he had not supported the messianic move-ment in Yemen at that time.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_703_YeQasmi] 'In contrast to this the fate of Jamal was far more bitter. When called before the governor of San'a, not the Imam Isma'il in Sfidah, during the Passover festival in 1667, he apparently did not deny his messianic belief. After arrest and torture "in a place beneath the ground,,91 he was handed over to "a second king in whose hand he used to place the tax", probably the'Amil of San' a, who was in charge of collecting the jizyah tax from the Jews and who therefore bore responsibility for them, and he too "locked him in a place of snakes and scorpions". They sent from San'a to the Imam asking him what to do with Jamal, since in the Zaydi ruling hierarchy the Imam was considered the supreme judge. The latter ordered that he be executed as a rebel against the kingdom who had grievously violated the protection agreement between the Zaydi state and the Jews, although in the history of Yemen Jewry only few cases are known of execution of Jews by the ruler.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_704_YeQasmi] 'Only then, apparently before the release of Naqqash from Qamaran island, were the leaders of the Jewish communities held in SCidah freed, "after suffering and large ransom", as Hamami writes on the New Moon of Second Adar in 1980 SE (1669), but without mention of the release of Naqqash. According to Hibshush,'OO the Jewish leaders remained in prison "a whole year, until the ministers of the land saved them, speaking reassuring and favourable words to the king".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_705_YeQasmi] 'Various natural disasters, especially a severe drought. that struck Yemen in the years following the execution of Jamal reinforced the opinion among Ihe Muslims in Yemen that the country was being punished for the act. For their part the Jews worked 10 spread and estab· Iish this view. II was also reported that a certain Jewish leader lOl vowed to take Muslim property to compensate for what the Imam Isma'il had confiscated from the Jews. It is related that he actually did so by means of witchcraft that destroyed Muslim propeny and harmed their villages and fields. 102 From a Hebrew source at our disposal, a lament by Shelo~ mo ben Ho!er al_'Uzayri,IOJ we learn that the reference is to the serious drought that occurred in 1669 throughout Yemen. This calamity struck the Jews in panicular, not only on account of the economic structure of the country, in which they were chiefly anisans remote from farming, but also owing to their poverty resulting from the heavy fines imposed on them and the expropriation of their property two years previously. The government, as was its wont, exploited these terrible circumstances, and did not supply the Jews with grain from its stores unless they convened. And indeed, as Hamami,l04 "about five hundred or more of Israel altered their faith, and it was as the generation of apostasy owing to the poverty that was from the start and owing to the famine that visited the earth", 'Uzayri points out not only the great famine but also the wandering of the Jews from place (0 place in search of food, and the decrees imposed on them by the "kingdom of evil" precisely at the time of their woe.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_706_YeQasmi] 'Some attenuation in the acts of repression against the Jews seems to have taken place towards the end of the life of the Imam Isma'il. In 1084 of the Hijrah (beginning 18 April 1673), he decided to release the propeny of the Jews that had been taken from them six years before. However. he imposed other taxes on the Jews in addition to the jizyah. 'OS The death of 15m3'11 and the ascent to power of his nephew alMahdi Ahmad ibn Hasan sparked the hope among the Jews of Yemen that an end to their suffering had come at last. An expression of this is three poems written by Shabazi in honour of this imam. '06 For our purpose of importance is the third poem, in which Shabazi says (translation from Arabic): "[...J In the rule of Ahmad I travelled peacefully and securely. My song is ended and my words are sealed with greetings of peace, may it embrace the seed of the Imam; there is nothing beyond them except the Messiah".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_707_YeQasmi] 'But the Jews of Yemen learned immediately that the cup of their suffering had not been filled by the execution, the imprisonment, the extra taxation, the fines, the confiscation of property and the discriminatory laws against them. The principal sources for this period are the Arabic chronicles and the legal opinions of the Muslim sages in Yemen regarding the settlement of the Jews in that country, as well as Shabazi's poems and Yihye Salin's Megillar Ternan. It emerges from Shabazi's poems107 that there was unremining pressure by the Zaydi government on the Jews to convert, and the Decree of the Orphans was renewed. lOB More important for the sUbject under review are the Arabic sources, because they reveal that the Imam Isma'il had already resolved to expel the Jews from Yemen, having concluded from the consequences of the messianic activity that their presence there was not beneficial for Islam and the Yemeni people. 109 The Qagi Shams ai-Islam Ahmad ibn ,Salin ibn abi al-Rijal writes in his opinion on the subject of the expulsion of the Jews thaI Isma'i1 commanded Ihis, and thaI in his own "holy scripl" he wrOle a will on his sickbed close 10 his death 1676, whose essence was Ihat the Jews of Yemen no longer enjoyed any protection by Ihe state and that it was obligatory to expel them from Yemen, Isma'il also willed thai no accounl be taken of any legal authorily, whoever he may be, who argued against the plain interpretation of Ihe hadirh allributed to Muhammad regarding the expulsion of the Jews from the Arabian Peninsula.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_708_YeQasmi] 'The Imam Isma'il therefore cited previous discussions on the settlement of the Jews in Yemen, and he wished to dismiss any interpretation that would permit their continued settlement. However, for various reasons, apparently economic in the main-the poverty of the country following the droughts-the heads of the Muslims from the family of the prophet Muhammad. the Sadah. succeeded in persuading Isma'il to act moderately, and at least (0 postpone the expulsion order for a certain period of time. Isma'il did not yield completely: although he gave up the idea of expulsion he requested the Muslim leaders who came to visit him during his illness to destroy the synagogues that had been built in Yemen; the intention was apparently those built after the rise of Islam; whose construction was forbidden in the terms of the protection.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_709_YeQasmi] 'Isma'il did not live to carry out what he desired, but his political testament was binding on his successor, Imam Ahmad. The latter, who like his predecessor was a great zaydi conqueror and expansionist, began to execute the will. On 28 September 1677 an order was sent by the Imam to the man who was eventually to inherit the crown of the imamate, Isma'il's son "Izz aI-Islam Muhammad,ll" on the expulsion of the Jews and the destruction of their synagogues. After giving the order he undertook discussions with the sages of Islam in San'a so as to win their support for the expulsion, which he then ascertained was a matter for controversy among the sages. On the other hand, all were agreed regarding the demolition of the synagogues. So that same year, 1677, the synagogue in San'a was locked up and those in the ai-Sawn area, northwest of San'a, were destroyed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_710_YeQasmi] 'Recently additional evidence has been published on the destruction of the synagogues in Yemen in those years, and this seems to indicate that these acts were restricted to the winter of 1678: "The razing of the synagogue of SUsan on the fourth day of the week which is third day of the year 1989 [SE-1678], and the enemie,s forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_711_YeQasmi] 'The consultations on the expulsion of the Jews were prolonged, the basic question being, as stated, if the prophet Muhammad had commanded the expulsion of the Jews from the entire Arabian Peninsula or from the Hijaz alone. liB Finally the Imam Ahmad resolved to implement the expulsion as a matter subject to the discretion of the ruler. as was the opinion of the Qadi ibn abi al_Rijal. l19 The 1ewish sources relate that the Jews were given the chance of converting to Islam in order to forestall the expulsion decree, an offer that they spumed, and that at first the intention was to deport them to the coast of Africa, beyond the Yemen borders. but through the intervention of Muslims close to the government the Imam Ahmad agreed to their expulsion to the Mawza' region in western Yemen near the pon of Mocha. And indeed, in 1679, about three years after Ahmad's succession, the Jews were expelled from all pans of Yemen to Mawza' _ Again, through the agency of the factors mentioned above, on account of the need for Jews in the country's economy as artisans and small traders, they were allowed to return from exile, albeit not to the same quarters and houses, but to new abodes near the cities yet outside the walls; the situation was similar regarding villages. l20 The construction of synagogues was no longer penniued and worship was conducted in private homes converted into prayer houses. In October 1679, after the Jews began their journey into exile, the Imam Ahmad ordered the doors of the San'a synagogue. which had been locked in 1676, to be opened; he took away the books and poured oul the wine kept in its storerooms. On the advice of ',Izz alIslam Muhammad ben Isma'i1 the synagogue was tom down, and in its stead a mosque was built, and given the name masjid al-jala' ("the mosque of the exile").'

More characteristic of social organization in the southern and coastal regions are smaller alliances and/or greater association with others residing in the same vicinity.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_713_YeQasmi] 'Yemenis recognize the concept of “closeness” to describe desired relationships through marriage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_714_YeQasmi] 'Landownership is concentrated within the dominant patrilineages, the result both of inheritance practices and marital strategies. Under Islamic rules, a woman's inheritance is only half that of her brother. In Yemen, women often do not renounce their claims of ownership. Thus the ideal marriage between patrilateral cousins would ensure that land remains within the patrilineage. Similarly, marriage to an outsider encourages the renunciation of claims to land that is too far away to farm.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_715_YeQasmi] Patriarchal values were important: 'Yemen shares in many of the customs and lifeways that are found in other parts of the Arab world. Culture is intensely patriarchal, and households usually consist of an extended family living in a single domicile or family compound. The head of the family is the eldest male, who makes all significant decisions for the family and its members. Women play a secondary role in running the household and raising the children and, in rural areas, helping to work the family farm. Though nearly one-fourth of Yemeni women obtain work outside the home, a woman traditionally earns most of her social status through bearing children, particularly males. The birth of a male child is considered one of the most important social events in Yemeni society and is followed almost immediately by a circumcision ceremony. Though prohibited by law in 2001, female genital cutting still occurs, taking place primarily in private and varying significantly by region.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_716_YeQasmi] Arranged endogamous marriages were the norm: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women. Customarily, wives (through fathers or brothers) must remunerate their husbands if they wish to terminate the marriage. Legally, fathers' rights to the children after divorce supersede those of mothers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_717_YeQasmi] 'Marriages are almost always arranged and frequently are undertaken at a young age. Although the opinion of a potential bride or groom might be solicited on the issue, the final decision on marriage belongs with the head of the household. As in many parts of the Islamic world, endogamy (the practice of marrying someone from within one’s own kin group) is common, the preferred marriage being with a paternal first cousin of the opposite gender. The practice of mahr (bride-price, given by the father of the groom) is a usual part of the marriage ceremony. Divorce is not common, but neither is there a stigma attached to it. Men may have as many as four wives at the same time, though in practice it is rare for a man to take more than one wife.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_718_YeQasmi] Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Women preside over the work of the household, which may be comprised of blood relatives, neighbors, and members of client or servant groups in families of high social status. Women are valued members of the household unit as agricultural producers and are also crucial to the maintenance of the Yemeni ideal of domestic hospitality.'

Thus the ideal marriage between patrilateral cousins would ensure that land remains within the patrilineage. Similarly, marriage to an outsider encourages the renunciation of claims to land that is too far away to farm.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_722_YeQasmi] Ascribed status determined membership in patrilineages; the same was true of sayyid, scholar and servant groups: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege-especially through marriage and education-to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as “deficient,” either because they provided a service or craft-such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering-that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean “cultivators,” and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_723_YeQasmi] 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning. Men gather at the mosque for prayers and sermons on the Sabbath, which in Yemen occurs on Friday. Strict segregation of the sexes usually does not permit women to worship in public.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_724_YeQasmi] Tribal affiliation was an important social identifier: 'Among Arab groups, tribal affiliation is another deep-seated component of social identity. Some tribal confederations have histories spanning more than two millennia. These affiliations continue to serve as a key basis for political and social organization throughout the country, although the postindependence governments of both South Yemen and, to a lesser extent, North Yemen set out to eradicate what then were considered reactionary cultural institutions. Although efforts toward detribalization were at least in part effective, subsequent events indicated that such identifications were still socially, economically, and politically relevant.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_725_YeQasmi] 'Yemeni society is tribally based, and trust and assurance most often are measured by degree of consanguinity. Families are very close and are the focus of the individual’s primary devotion; one’s second allegiance is to the tribe, an extended family unit that ordinarily traces its ties to a common eponymous ancestor. In rural Yemen, state authority is weak, and disputes between tribes are frequently solved through violence. The art of the feud is still quite real, and, as a consequence, Yemen is a gun culture. Virtually every household has at least one weapon, and men and boys often carry firearms in public. Even when not carrying a pistol or a rifle, most Yemeni males-particularly those belonging to a rural tribe-will carry a dagger, the traditional janbiyyah (or jambiyyah), a short, broad, curved blade sheathed on a belt worn across the abdomen and serving as a signal of one’s status within social and tribal hierarchies.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_726_YeQasmi] 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_727_YeQasmi] Religion was another important social divider: 'Throughout society, the broadest distinctions between population groups are based not on ethnicity but on religious affiliation. Islam is the state religion, and the Sunni branch of Islam, represented by the Shāfiʿī school, predominates. The Shīʿite minority consists of the Zaydī school, which has long been politically dominant in the mountainous highlands of the north, and the Ismāʿīlīs, now a relatively small group found in the Haraz region of northern Yemen and in Jabal Manakhah, the mountainous area west of Sanaa. The non-Muslim community is very small, consisting mostly of foreign visitors and workers. All are free to worship as they wish-including the Jewish community-but, as in most conservative Muslim countries, proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is illegal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_728_YeQasmi] Low social status often intersected with ethnicity: 'Ethnic minorities include the Mahra, a people whose roots are unclear and who occupy a part of eastern Yemen, as well as the island of Socotra, and who speak a variant of the ancient Himyaritic language. (See Mahra Sultanate.) On the Tihāmah coastal plain, in-migrations from Ethiopia and Somalia have occurred over many centuries. There is a clear African admixture in the coastal population as well as a distinct social group known as the Akhdām, who perform menial tasks and are the closest thing to a caste in Yemen. In the far north there are still small remnants of the once-large Jewish communities (most migrated to Israel after 1948), while in the area of Aden and the eastern regions there are distinct Somali, Indonesian, and Indian elements in the population, legacies of the British colonial era as well of economic and political ties extending back over two millennia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_729_YeQasmi] It appears that members of subservient social groups and ethnicities were traditionally excluded from land ownership: 'Farmers either own their plots, which tend to be small, or they work as shareholders. No stigma is attached to nonlandowners unless one is a member of a group that, in the past, was not permitted to buy land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_730_YeQasmi] Jews were also excluded from land ownership and their property was confiscated and plundered, at least temporarily: 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis.

The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection.

My song is ended and my words are sealed with greetings of peace, may it embrace the seed of the Imam; there is nothing beyond them except the Messiah".'

More characteristic of social organization in the southern and coastal regions are smaller alliances and/or greater association with others residing in the same vicinity.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_734_YeQasmi] 'Yemenis recognize the concept of “closeness” to describe desired relationships through marriage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_735_YeQasmi] 'Landownership is concentrated within the dominant patrilineages, the result both of inheritance practices and marital strategies. Under Islamic rules, a woman's inheritance is only half that of her brother. In Yemen, women often do not renounce their claims of ownership. Thus the ideal marriage between patrilateral cousins would ensure that land remains within the patrilineage. Similarly, marriage to an outsider encourages the renunciation of claims to land that is too far away to farm.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_736_YeQasmi] Ascribed status determined membership in patrilineages; the same was true of sayyid, scholar and servant groups: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege-especially through marriage and education-to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as “deficient,” either because they provided a service or craft-such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering-that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean “cultivators,” and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_737_YeQasmi] 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning. Men gather at the mosque for prayers and sermons on the Sabbath, which in Yemen occurs on Friday. Strict segregation of the sexes usually does not permit women to worship in public.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_738_YeQasmi] Tribal affiliation was an important social identifier: 'Among Arab groups, tribal affiliation is another deep-seated component of social identity. Some tribal confederations have histories spanning more than two millennia. These affiliations continue to serve as a key basis for political and social organization throughout the country, although the postindependence governments of both South Yemen and, to a lesser extent, North Yemen set out to eradicate what then were considered reactionary cultural institutions. Although efforts toward detribalization were at least in part effective, subsequent events indicated that such identifications were still socially, economically, and politically relevant.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_739_YeQasmi] 'Yemeni society is tribally based, and trust and assurance most often are measured by degree of consanguinity. Families are very close and are the focus of the individual’s primary devotion; one’s second allegiance is to the tribe, an extended family unit that ordinarily traces its ties to a common eponymous ancestor. In rural Yemen, state authority is weak, and disputes between tribes are frequently solved through violence. The art of the feud is still quite real, and, as a consequence, Yemen is a gun culture. Virtually every household has at least one weapon, and men and boys often carry firearms in public. Even when not carrying a pistol or a rifle, most Yemeni males-particularly those belonging to a rural tribe-will carry a dagger, the traditional janbiyyah (or jambiyyah), a short, broad, curved blade sheathed on a belt worn across the abdomen and serving as a signal of one’s status within social and tribal hierarchies.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_740_YeQasmi] 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_741_YeQasmi] Religion was another important social divider: 'Throughout society, the broadest distinctions between population groups are based not on ethnicity but on religious affiliation. Islam is the state religion, and the Sunni branch of Islam, represented by the Shāfiʿī school, predominates. The Shīʿite minority consists of the Zaydī school, which has long been politically dominant in the mountainous highlands of the north, and the Ismāʿīlīs, now a relatively small group found in the Haraz region of northern Yemen and in Jabal Manakhah, the mountainous area west of Sanaa. The non-Muslim community is very small, consisting mostly of foreign visitors and workers. All are free to worship as they wish-including the Jewish community-but, as in most conservative Muslim countries, proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is illegal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_742_YeQasmi] Low social status often intersected with ethnicity: 'Ethnic minorities include the Mahra, a people whose roots are unclear and who occupy a part of eastern Yemen, as well as the island of Socotra, and who speak a variant of the ancient Himyaritic language. (See Mahra Sultanate.) On the Tihāmah coastal plain, in-migrations from Ethiopia and Somalia have occurred over many centuries. There is a clear African admixture in the coastal population as well as a distinct social group known as the Akhdām, who perform menial tasks and are the closest thing to a caste in Yemen. In the far north there are still small remnants of the once-large Jewish communities (most migrated to Israel after 1948), while in the area of Aden and the eastern regions there are distinct Somali, Indonesian, and Indian elements in the population, legacies of the British colonial era as well of economic and political ties extending back over two millennia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_743_YeQasmi] It appears that members of subservient social groups and ethnicities were traditionally excluded from land ownership: 'Farmers either own their plots, which tend to be small, or they work as shareholders. No stigma is attached to nonlandowners unless one is a member of a group that, in the past, was not permitted to buy land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_744_YeQasmi] Jews were also excluded from land ownership and their property was confiscated and plundered, at least temporarily: 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_745_YeQasmi]  'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_746_YeQasmi] 'Some attenuation in the acts of repression against the Jews seems to have taken place towards the end of the life of the Imam Isma'il. In 1084 of the Hijrah (beginning 18 April 1673), he decided to release the propeny of the Jews that had been taken from them six years before. However. he imposed other taxes on the Jews in addition to the jizyah. 'OS The death of 15m3'11 and the ascent to power of his nephew alMahdi Ahmad ibn Hasan sparked the hope among the Jews of Yemen that an end to their suffering had come at last. An expression of this is three poems written by Shabazi in honour of this imam.

The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean “cultivators,” and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_766_YeQasmi] 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning. Men gather at the mosque for prayers and sermons on the Sabbath, which in Yemen occurs on Friday. Strict segregation of the sexes usually does not permit women to worship in public.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_767_YeQasmi] Tribal affiliation was an important social identifier: 'Among Arab groups, tribal affiliation is another deep-seated component of social identity. Some tribal confederations have histories spanning more than two millennia. These affiliations continue to serve as a key basis for political and social organization throughout the country, although the postindependence governments of both South Yemen and, to a lesser extent, North Yemen set out to eradicate what then were considered reactionary cultural institutions. Although efforts toward detribalization were at least in part effective, subsequent events indicated that such identifications were still socially, economically, and politically relevant.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_768_YeQasmi] 'Yemeni society is tribally based, and trust and assurance most often are measured by degree of consanguinity. Families are very close and are the focus of the individual’s primary devotion; one’s second allegiance is to the tribe, an extended family unit that ordinarily traces its ties to a common eponymous ancestor. In rural Yemen, state authority is weak, and disputes between tribes are frequently solved through violence. The art of the feud is still quite real, and, as a consequence, Yemen is a gun culture. Virtually every household has at least one weapon, and men and boys often carry firearms in public. Even when not carrying a pistol or a rifle, most Yemeni males-particularly those belonging to a rural tribe-will carry a dagger, the traditional janbiyyah (or jambiyyah), a short, broad, curved blade sheathed on a belt worn across the abdomen and serving as a signal of one’s status within social and tribal hierarchies.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_769_YeQasmi] 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_770_YeQasmi] Religion was another important social divider: 'Throughout society, the broadest distinctions between population groups are based not on ethnicity but on religious affiliation. Islam is the state religion, and the Sunni branch of Islam, represented by the Shāfiʿī school, predominates. The Shīʿite minority consists of the Zaydī school, which has long been politically dominant in the mountainous highlands of the north, and the Ismāʿīlīs, now a relatively small group found in the Haraz region of northern Yemen and in Jabal Manakhah, the mountainous area west of Sanaa. The non-Muslim community is very small, consisting mostly of foreign visitors and workers. All are free to worship as they wish-including the Jewish community-but, as in most conservative Muslim countries, proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is illegal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_771_YeQasmi] Low social status often intersected with ethnicity: 'Ethnic minorities include the Mahra, a people whose roots are unclear and who occupy a part of eastern Yemen, as well as the island of Socotra, and who speak a variant of the ancient Himyaritic language. (See Mahra Sultanate.) On the Tihāmah coastal plain, in-migrations from Ethiopia and Somalia have occurred over many centuries. There is a clear African admixture in the coastal population as well as a distinct social group known as the Akhdām, who perform menial tasks and are the closest thing to a caste in Yemen. In the far north there are still small remnants of the once-large Jewish communities (most migrated to Israel after 1948), while in the area of Aden and the eastern regions there are distinct Somali, Indonesian, and Indian elements in the population, legacies of the British colonial era as well of economic and political ties extending back over two millennia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_772_YeQasmi] The intersection of low social status with the performance of 'impure' and subservient economic roles and the determination of rights to social support by tribal affiliation seem to justify coding this variable for the more hierarchical option. Inequality co-existed with the notion of 'noblesse oblige': 'Looking back from the early twentieth century to the great days of the Qasimis, an anonymous chronicler paints a picture of righteous patronage (al-Hibshi 1980: 300-4): "The times smiled on the people of that age, and the reason was that all of Yemen was in the hand of the state: its ports, [Lower] Yemen, Raymah, 'Utmah, and everywhere, so fodder evengrewin the lands beyondBarat ... The first thing was that the Imam followed the pure shari'ah, even as it affected himself and what he owned. Then the Shaykh al-Islam was reverenced for executing affairs in accordance with God's Book and His Prophet's usage, and no-one accusedhim of taking evena pip or a pip-skin from the parties to a case. The reason for that was that he had a fief ... which paid not less than about 1,000 qadab ... and still had al-Haymah which paid about 100 silverpieces a month. Andeveryone he knewor was close to ate with him [i.e. lived off him], and he himselfsaved nothing of what he got. After him came the sayyids of the Imam's family ... After them came the ministers, five or six of them ... everyone of whom had limitless people living with him [i.e. off his largesse] ..." And so on through the ranks (all of them ad hoc; Zaydi theory says not a word of this organization), down through the servants of servants all claiming their bread, clothes, and money from someone above them, to the lists of the great's benefactions for poor people at the several festivals. A cataract of pious largesse; and the other half of the cycle (the question of income to support this expenditure) is nowhere addressed in detail.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_773_YeQasmi] 'So far as the tribes are concerned, this need not surprise us. The complement of segmentary equality is very often the gift min allah, from God, which therefore does not require reciprocity; indeed, the position of wealthy leaders in an egalitarian system is scarcely possible without this." But here the ethic of largesse permeated the whole functioning of the state, applying equally to townsfolk and traders, peasants and tribesmen, to everyone who wished for wealth. The lines of payment all ran normal to the axis of precise reciprocity which defines tribes or sections against their neighbours, and each line thus ran parallel to the others; their arrangement in an ordered series ('all of Yemen was in the hand of the state') depended solely on the Imam's 'prestige' (haybah). With or without such subordination, however, local lines of subsidy to this tribe or that persisted, and in practice this was a period at which a distinction was made clear which one finds still in documents very close to our own time: that between tribesmen (qabii'il) and peasants (ra'iyyah), 'subjects', people who pay tax.l" It was prominent shaykhs who formed the link between the two.'

At the time, most Yemenis were subsistence agriculturalists: 'Various tasks in the cultivation of crops are divided according to sex. Men, women, and children share responsibility for the care of livestock. Women gather firewood and water; in some regions, they now receive assistance from the men, who have acquired Japanese trucks. The family's livelihood may also depend on women selling homemade goods and produce in the marketplace.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_775_YeQasmi] 'Yemen’s difficult terrain, limited soil, inconsistent water supply, and large number of microclimates have fostered some of the most highly sophisticated methods of water conservation and seed adaptation found anywhere in the world, making possible the cultivation of surprisingly diverse crops. The most common crops are cereals such as millet, corn (maize), wheat, barley, and sorghum; myriad vegetables from a burgeoning truck farm industry have appeared on the market in recent years. There has also been extensive cultivation of fruits-both tropical (mangoes, plantains, bananas, melons, papayas, and citrus) and temperate (pears, peaches, apples, and grapes). The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis). The coffee trade, which began in the 16th century, was originally based on Yemeni coffee, and, for centuries, coffee was the most important and renowned export of Yemen. The port city of Mocha-from which a distinctive style of coffee takes its name-was the point from which most of Yemen’s coffee was exported between the 16th and 18th centuries, before more-economical plantation cultivation was introduced in other parts of the world. In Yemen the coffee tree grows best in the middle highlands, at elevations of 4,500 to 6,500 feet (1,400 to 2,000 metres), where khat also flourishes.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_776_YeQasmi] 'The typical Yemeni farmer raises at least some poultry and livestock, typically regional varieties of chickens, goats, sheep, or cattle. Agricultural aid programs sponsored by Western countries in the 1970s and ’80s introduced new varieties of dairy and beef cattle in the more temperate regions of the north, but Yemen still imports much of the livestock and dairy and poultry products it consumes.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_777_YeQasmi] Coffee and khat were important cash crops: 'The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis).

In Yemen the coffee tree grows best in the middle highlands, at elevations of 4,500 to 6,500 feet (1,400 to 2,000 metres), where khat also flourishes. The latter is an evergreen shrub whose young leaves, which contain an alkaloid, are chewed as a mild stimulant. The production and consumption of khat occupy a prominent position in the culture and economy of Yemen. Increased affluence has allowed a growing section of the population to indulge in its use, which the government has attempted-with little success-to discourage. Greater demand has fueled a substantial increase in khat acreage. Although older coffee terraces are often converted to khat as their productivity declines, much of the land being devoted to khat was formerly considered marginal for commercial agricultural purposes and now benefits from regular soil-enhancement programs and terrace-maintenance efforts.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_778_YeQasmi] Cotton became more common in the 20th century: 'Beginning in the 1970s, the cultivation of cotton-both in the Tihāmah coastal plain in the north and in the coastal plain east of Aden-was strongly supported by the respective national governments, and for a while it contributed significantly to national income. At the end of the 20th century, a significant decline in world cotton prices, as well as the high costs of initiation and development, meant that the Yemeni cotton industry was not competitive.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_779_YeQasmi] Accordingly, we have assumed that occupational mobility was low for more Yemenis at the time.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Slavery">Slavery</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=YeQasmi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=64" title="Edit section: Slavery">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ ♥</b> Walters mentions slavery, but does not provide a detailed description: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation.

Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_801_YeQasmi] Low social status often intersected with ethnicity: 'Ethnic minorities include the Mahra, a people whose roots are unclear and who occupy a part of eastern Yemen, as well as the island of Socotra, and who speak a variant of the ancient Himyaritic language. (See Mahra Sultanate.) On the Tihāmah coastal plain, in-migrations from Ethiopia and Somalia have occurred over many centuries. There is a clear African admixture in the coastal population as well as a distinct social group known as the Akhdām, who perform menial tasks and are the closest thing to a caste in Yemen. In the far north there are still small remnants of the once-large Jewish communities (most migrated to Israel after 1948), while in the area of Aden and the eastern regions there are distinct Somali, Indonesian, and Indian elements in the population, legacies of the British colonial era as well of economic and political ties extending back over two millennia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_802_YeQasmi] The intersection of low social status with the performance of 'impure' and subservient economic roles and the role of ethnicity in this process seem to justify coding this variable for the more hierarchical option. Furthermore, Jews were violently persecuted after the emergence of a Messianic movement. The codebook does not currently provide a category for status discrimination based on religion, but religion and ethnicity could be considered to intersect in the case of the Yemeni Jewish community. Tobi provides a historical description of repressive measures directed at Jews: 'In 1629 power in San'a was retaken by the native populalion after the Turks were driven out by the sons of the Zaydi Imam al-Qasim, who had firsl risen in revolt against them at the end of the previous century. While the Jews did not live at ease under Turkish rule, especially in its last years, as attested by Shalom Shabazi in his commentary to the Pentateuch liemdat Yamim,7 their lot deteriorated under the Zaydi yoke. The latter were religious fanatics and far stricter than the Sunni Ottomans (of the Hanafi school) in their treatment of Jews as ahl aidhimmah. 8 But to the religious facet was added the national facet, for the new Zaydi rulers accused the Jews of siding with the infidel Turks.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_803_YeQasmi] 'Religious ardour apparently intensified in particular under al-Qasim's son, the Imam Ism3'il al-Mutawakkil, who took power in 1644 and who was zealously religious. 'o Despite all the foregoing, there is no evidence whatever in the Jewish sources that at a certain date prior to the events associated with Shabbetay Zevi in 1667 acts of repression were carried out against the Jews of Yemen. On the other hand, according to various sources the latter expected the coming of the Messiah in the course of the seventeenth century, from the year 1619 on. This was connected with the appearance of two comets that year, according to Yisrael HaKohen of Qubayrah, the city of the priests in the Shar'ab province in southern Yemen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_804_YeQasmi] 'In the years immediately following 1619 the Jews of Yemen encountered great distress in the form of apostasy and incarceration and tonure at the hands of the Turkish rulers, worsened by the starvation resuhing from this and from a plague of locusts. Among the casualties were Yosef ben Avigad, Shabazi's father, and members of his family, as he relates in the sequel to the account of the comets in 1619. These harsh events were perceived as the birth-pangs preceding the advent of the Messiah, as indicated by the writing of zakharyah Ha-Zidoni, who in 1626 (1937 of the SE) expected the arrival of the Messiah in 1940 of the SE ("'In the year 1940 You shall accomplish vengeance") (a pun in Hebrew on the number of the year and the word for vengeance). That year was 1629, the year in which the Turks were driven out of San'a by the sons of al-Qasim, the Imam who rebelled against the foreign yoke.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_805_YeQasmi] 'The first information on Shabbetay Zevi reached Yemen very late, in 1666,30 when the Sabbatean movement was at its height and close to the time of the apocalypse expected that year.31 But it is noteworthy that at that time the advent of the Messiah was expected not only on the basis of this information and the omen of the two comets of 1619, since which time eighty years had not yet passed (see above), but also on the basis of another comet that had appeared in 1665. The only intimation of this is in one of the manuscripts of Shabazi's ll.emdat Yamim, in which the following appendage is found after the above account of the 1619 comelS: "In the year 1976 of Lht: SE a star arose before it like a flame and described a circle until it returned behind it; perhaps this is the star of the Messiah."' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_806_YeQasmi] 'Following the impression made by these events, but without any connection to&nbsp;!.hem, one year later-I 666--letters reached Yemen from Safed and Egypt. apparently Alexandria, telling of the approach of the end of days and of the Messiah Shabbetay Zevi.J ) Some of the letters from Egypt reached the heads of the San'a community-Yihye Ha-Levi, who was head of the court of justice at San'a, and Siayman alNaqqash, the leader of the community. h is not stated explicitly that they were sent to them, and it seems that they were handed over to them by Yemeni Jews. Many of the Jews of Yemen had been led to believe in the messianism of Shabbetay Zevi and the prophecy of Nathan Ha' Azzati, who are the only two figures of the Sabbatean movement to whom reference is made in the letters of the Yemeni sages, even though the heads of the community, in San'a at least, rejected the rumours of redemption:'4 Like Jewish communities outside Yemen, the excitement caused by the tales of Shabbetay Zevi resulted in the occurrence of soothsaying among the Jews in San'a and the neighbouring communities, and also in the communities of the south_ The soothsayers (even including some women), called "heralds" in the sources,35 conducted propaganda on behalf of Shabbetay Zevi and encouraged the Jews to perfonn purification rites and mortification for the coming of the Messiah: it was forbidden to eat meat other than roasted, to drink wine even on Passover eve, to shave the hair of the women's heads, and to engage in sexual intercourse; food was to be dipped in dust and ashes and not in salt, etc. These customs were elaborated by the Sahbateans in Yemen of their own accord. although they had read about the act of purification and mortification in the letters promoting the movement that had reached Vemen from abroad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_807_YeQasmi] 'The Muslims in Yemen oppressed and humiliated the Jews, for which the author appeals to God thus: "Restore us against the tribula· tion and the torture and the humiliations that we have encountered in this exile" (p. 135). It seems that the oppression intensified after the Turks withdrew from Yemen in the 1630s. in particular under the rule of the zealous Imam al·Mut3wakkil Isma'il who ascended the throne in 1644: "Israel has borne several decrees and oppression and a large lax every month and all the days since the year DROR" (-541011650) (p.16). The straitened circumstances of the Yemeni ex.ile also become clear from the interpretation of the verse in Psalms 70:20: "In our exile we suffer from three calamities, the first is persecutions, wandering and slavery; the second is agony, poverty and humiliation; the third is war, abuse and famine" (p, 136), Moreover, from the author's vision of the future status of the Jews of Yemen following redemption something may be learned of their humiliation and resentment stemming from the special ta:&lt; they had to pay for protection by the Muslim ruler: "When the Messiah from the tribe of Ephrayim will appear [.,,] [in the year 5426 [1666J the [Arab] king [...] who was wandering in the desert [...] will distribule letters all over his kingdom 10 enhance the Jews [",] hoping to find reSI and peace and ease to his nation of the known nalion" (the Jews, p, 110), "The Lord will send a spirit in the tongue of every king and governor to announce in the markets and in the streets, saying: Peace. peace for Israel, they shall not pay any more mindah, bela and halakh06 (p. 138).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_808_YeQasmi] 'Elsewhere in the work it transpires that in fact during the rule of al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, cases of apostasy mulliplied under threat of persecution and by decree: these are the birth pangs of the Messiah and a hidden means of discovering if indeed there is complete repentance that will justify redemption (pp. 114-115).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_809_YeQasmi] 'We have observed above that the belief in Shabbetay Zevi in Yemen propagated mainly among the ordinary folk, while the leaders of the San'a community at least, the President Naqqash and the head of the rabbinical court Yihye Ha-Levi, were skeptical about i1.68 As we shall see below, these reservations on the part of these two, and apparently of other leaders in the San'a and other communities, are what saved them from the unnatural death that was the lot of Siayman Jamal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_810_YeQasmi] 'A contemporary Yemeni Muslim writer, 'Abd Allah ibn'Ali ibn al· Wazir, was the author of Iibtiq al-liulwti wa-Jihtif ai-Man wa·l-Salwa. Relating to the year 1077 of the Hijrah (beginning 4 July 1666), he sets out extremely important details on the messianic activity in Yemen that year.69 He states that it began in the month Rajab 1077 of the Hijrah, that is, January 1667. Presumably some time passed, at least several months, between the actual start of messianic activity in Yemen and the moment when the Muslims began to take note of it. The Muslim chronicle states, and this is borne out by what we know from the Hebrew sources, that the Jews sold their possessions cheaply and made preparations for their ascent to the Land of Israel, as the Messiah had been revealed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_811_YeQasmi] 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_812_YeQasmi] 'According to ibn al-Wazir, the stonn abated and the Imam took no funher steps against the Jews. But the Jews themselves, that is, those who held the messianic belief. exploited this time of calm and continued their messianic activity not only in secret but openly, There is no doubt that the official leaders of the San'a community did not participate, except for a certain group headed by one of its sages. The Muslim chronicler relates that in the course of a wine-drinking feast a member of this group became intoxicated and his companions dressed him in the finest garments. This may have been an indication of the messianic aspirations of that individual, as we shall see below. In any event, this man climbed up to the largest fortress of San'a, situated in the eastern outskirts of the city, and attempted to ascend to the throne and the canopy in the fortress, that is, to become ruler of the Muslims. He even made the outspoken demand that the Muslim commanders and soldiers in the fortress place themselves under his command. But instead the latter arrested the man and threw him into the Bustan prison in the city. The Imam was infonned of what had transpired. and he ordered the prisoner to be taken out and executed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_813_YeQasmi] 'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_814_YeQasmi] 'The leaders of the Jewish communities were arrested and tortured in several prisons, and the sentence of death hovered over lhem. As usual in cases of this kind in Yemen, Jews so sentenced were offered their lives in return for conversion to Islam;84 but the offer was rejected.l.S Naqqash, the nagid of the San'a community, was exiled to Qamaran86 in the Red Sea, a mostly deserted island populated by a few fishermen and a handful of villagers who made their living by pearl diving87 and which was used as a prison island for political offenders.88 He remained imprisoned and shackled for two years and only lhen was he released and returned to San'a.89 During the Mawza' exile, in 1679, he was still officiating as the nagid of the San'a community.90 It appears that his release was due to the fact that like other leaders of the San'a and other communities he had not supported the messianic move-ment in Yemen at that time.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_815_YeQasmi] 'In contrast to this the fate of Jamal was far more bitter. When called before the governor of San'a, not the Imam Isma'il in Sfidah, during the Passover festival in 1667, he apparently did not deny his messianic belief. After arrest and torture "in a place beneath the ground,,91 he was handed over to "a second king in whose hand he used to place the tax", probably the'Amil of San' a, who was in charge of collecting the jizyah tax from the Jews and who therefore bore responsibility for them, and he too "locked him in a place of snakes and scorpions". They sent from San'a to the Imam asking him what to do with Jamal, since in the Zaydi ruling hierarchy the Imam was considered the supreme judge. The latter ordered that he be executed as a rebel against the kingdom who had grievously violated the protection agreement between the Zaydi state and the Jews, although in the history of Yemen Jewry only few cases are known of execution of Jews by the ruler.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_816_YeQasmi] 'Only then, apparently before the release of Naqqash from Qamaran island, were the leaders of the Jewish communities held in SCidah freed, "after suffering and large ransom", as Hamami writes on the New Moon of Second Adar in 1980 SE (1669), but without mention of the release of Naqqash. According to Hibshush,'OO the Jewish leaders remained in prison "a whole year, until the ministers of the land saved them, speaking reassuring and favourable words to the king".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_817_YeQasmi] 'Various natural disasters, especially a severe drought. that struck Yemen in the years following the execution of Jamal reinforced the opinion among Ihe Muslims in Yemen that the country was being punished for the act. For their part the Jews worked 10 spread and estab· Iish this view. II was also reported that a certain Jewish leader lOl vowed to take Muslim property to compensate for what the Imam Isma'il had confiscated from the Jews. It is related that he actually did so by means of witchcraft that destroyed Muslim propeny and harmed their villages and fields. 102 From a Hebrew source at our disposal, a lament by Shelo~ mo ben Ho!er al_'Uzayri,IOJ we learn that the reference is to the serious drought that occurred in 1669 throughout Yemen. This calamity struck the Jews in panicular, not only on account of the economic structure of the country, in which they were chiefly anisans remote from farming, but also owing to their poverty resulting from the heavy fines imposed on them and the expropriation of their property two years previously. The government, as was its wont, exploited these terrible circumstances, and did not supply the Jews with grain from its stores unless they convened. And indeed, as Hamami,l04 "about five hundred or more of Israel altered their faith, and it was as the generation of apostasy owing to the poverty that was from the start and owing to the famine that visited the earth", 'Uzayri points out not only the great famine but also the wandering of the Jews from place (0 place in search of food, and the decrees imposed on them by the "kingdom of evil" precisely at the time of their woe.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_818_YeQasmi] 'Some attenuation in the acts of repression against the Jews seems to have taken place towards the end of the life of the Imam Isma'il. In 1084 of the Hijrah (beginning 18 April 1673), he decided to release the propeny of the Jews that had been taken from them six years before. However. he imposed other taxes on the Jews in addition to the jizyah. 'OS The death of 15m3'11 and the ascent to power of his nephew alMahdi Ahmad ibn Hasan sparked the hope among the Jews of Yemen that an end to their suffering had come at last. An expression of this is three poems written by Shabazi in honour of this imam. '06 For our purpose of importance is the third poem, in which Shabazi says (translation from Arabic): "[...J In the rule of Ahmad I travelled peacefully and securely. My song is ended and my words are sealed with greetings of peace, may it embrace the seed of the Imam; there is nothing beyond them except the Messiah".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_819_YeQasmi] 'But the Jews of Yemen learned immediately that the cup of their suffering had not been filled by the execution, the imprisonment, the extra taxation, the fines, the confiscation of property and the discriminatory laws against them. The principal sources for this period are the Arabic chronicles and the legal opinions of the Muslim sages in Yemen regarding the settlement of the Jews in that country, as well as Shabazi's poems and Yihye Salin's Megillar Ternan. It emerges from Shabazi's poems107 that there was unremining pressure by the Zaydi government on the Jews to convert, and the Decree of the Orphans was renewed. lOB More important for the sUbject under review are the Arabic sources, because they reveal that the Imam Isma'il had already resolved to expel the Jews from Yemen, having concluded from the consequences of the messianic activity that their presence there was not beneficial for Islam and the Yemeni people. 109 The Qagi Shams ai-Islam Ahmad ibn ,Salin ibn abi al-Rijal writes in his opinion on the subject of the expulsion of the Jews thaI Isma'i1 commanded Ihis, and thaI in his own "holy scripl" he wrOle a will on his sickbed close 10 his death 1676, whose essence was Ihat the Jews of Yemen no longer enjoyed any protection by Ihe state and that it was obligatory to expel them from Yemen, Isma'il also willed thai no accounl be taken of any legal authorily, whoever he may be, who argued against the plain interpretation of Ihe hadirh allributed to Muhammad regarding the expulsion of the Jews from the Arabian Peninsula.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_820_YeQasmi] 'The Imam Isma'il therefore cited previous discussions on the settlement of the Jews in Yemen, and he wished to dismiss any interpretation that would permit their continued settlement. However, for various reasons, apparently economic in the main-the poverty of the country following the droughts-the heads of the Muslims from the family of the prophet Muhammad. the Sadah. succeeded in persuading Isma'il to act moderately, and at least (0 postpone the expulsion order for a certain period of time. Isma'il did not yield completely: although he gave up the idea of expulsion he requested the Muslim leaders who came to visit him during his illness to destroy the synagogues that had been built in Yemen; the intention was apparently those built after the rise of Islam; whose construction was forbidden in the terms of the protection.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_821_YeQasmi] 'Isma'il did not live to carry out what he desired, but his political testament was binding on his successor, Imam Ahmad. The latter, who like his predecessor was a great zaydi conqueror and expansionist, began to execute the will. On 28 September 1677 an order was sent by the Imam to the man who was eventually to inherit the crown of the imamate, Isma'il's son "Izz aI-Islam Muhammad,ll" on the expulsion of the Jews and the destruction of their synagogues. After giving the order he undertook discussions with the sages of Islam in San'a so as to win their support for the expulsion, which he then ascertained was a matter for controversy among the sages. On the other hand, all were agreed regarding the demolition of the synagogues. So that same year, 1677, the synagogue in San'a was locked up and those in the ai-Sawn area, northwest of San'a, were destroyed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_822_YeQasmi] 'Recently additional evidence has been published on the destruction of the synagogues in Yemen in those years, and this seems to indicate that these acts were restricted to the winter of 1678: "The razing of the synagogue of SUsan on the fourth day of the week which is third day of the year 1989 [SE-1678], and the enemie,s forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_823_YeQasmi] 'The consultations on the expulsion of the Jews were prolonged, the basic question being, as stated, if the prophet Muhammad had commanded the expulsion of the Jews from the entire Arabian Peninsula or from the Hijaz alone. liB Finally the Imam Ahmad resolved to implement the expulsion as a matter subject to the discretion of the ruler. as was the opinion of the Qadi ibn abi al_Rijal. l19 The 1ewish sources relate that the Jews were given the chance of converting to Islam in order to forestall the expulsion decree, an offer that they spumed, and that at first the intention was to deport them to the coast of Africa, beyond the Yemen borders. but through the intervention of Muslims close to the government the Imam Ahmad agreed to their expulsion to the Mawza' region in western Yemen near the pon of Mocha. And indeed, in 1679, about three years after Ahmad's succession, the Jews were expelled from all pans of Yemen to Mawza' _ Again, through the agency of the factors mentioned above, on account of the need for Jews in the country's economy as artisans and small traders, they were allowed to return from exile, albeit not to the same quarters and houses, but to new abodes near the cities yet outside the walls; the situation was similar regarding villages. l20 The construction of synagogues was no longer penniued and worship was conducted in private homes converted into prayer houses. In October 1679, after the Jews began their journey into exile, the Imam Ahmad ordered the doors of the San'a synagogue. which had been locked in 1676, to be opened; he took away the books and poured oul the wine kept in its storerooms. On the advice of ',Izz alIslam Muhammad ben Isma'i1 the synagogue was tom down, and in its stead a mosque was built, and given the name masjid al-jala' ("the mosque of the exile").' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_824_YeQasmi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ uncertain_present_absent ♥</b> “Both supporters and critics of Islam turn to the Qur'an, sunna, and Islamic law to justify their claims about Islam's stance towards women. For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minūn) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_825_YeQasmi] In Yemen, wives were in a weaker legal position than husbands in the case of divorce: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women. Customarily, wives (through fathers or brothers) must remunerate their husbands if they wish to terminate the marriage. Legally, fathers' rights to the children after divorce supersede those of mothers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_826_YeQasmi] Veiling was common in the North: 'The traditional nature of Yemeni society is reflected in choices of attire, though the native dress of Yemen differs somewhat from that found in other conservative parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Men sometimes wear the full-length, loose-fitting thawb-frequently with a jacket over it-but more often the traditional fūṭah, a saronglike wraparound kilt, is worn with a shirt. The turban is a common type of head covering, and a finely woven bamboo hat (shaped somewhat like a fez) called a kofiya (or kofia) is a more formal choice of headgear. There are various forms of dress for women, depending on the social role a woman plays and where she lives. In North Yemen, women in cities and towns wore the sharsaf, a black skirt, scarf, and veil ensemble that covers the entire body. In South Yemen, the regime that succeeded the British after 1967 vigorously opposed this women's dress code, and this opposition prevailed especially in the towns and cities. In the countryside, clothing for women tends to be somewhat more utilitarian and may consist of a dress or robe that provides for a greater range of movement and under which, in some parts of Yemen, it is not uncommon for a woman to wear a pair of loose slacks known as a sirwāl. Also in the countryside, a woman's face may or may not be covered, and dresses are sometimes sewn from brightly coloured fabric. Working women frequently wear a broad-brimmed straw hat (dhola) to ward off the sun.'

Zaydism was established in Yemen by the imam Yahya al-Hadi (d. 911), a descendant of Ali's son Hasan who migrated from Medina to Yemen late in the ninth century and established his capital at the northern highland city of Sada. Unlike Ismaili or Twelver Shiite doctrine, Zaydi theology posits an active, visible imam, or leader of the Muslim community, descended from either Hasan or his brother Husayn, who is learned in the religious sciences and who publicly proves himself worthy of leading the Muslim community, in battle if necessary. What this has meant in Yemeni history is that scions of numerous lines of Hasanid and, less frequently, Husaynid descendants have proclaimed their dawas, or "calls"-occasionally simultaneously, so that the supporters of one line were obliged to fight it out with supporters of another.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_834_YeQasmi] Low social status often intersected with ethnicity: 'Ethnic minorities include the Mahra, a people whose roots are unclear and who occupy a part of eastern Yemen, as well as the island of Socotra, and who speak a variant of the ancient Himyaritic language. (See Mahra Sultanate.) On the Tihāmah coastal plain, in-migrations from Ethiopia and Somalia have occurred over many centuries. There is a clear African admixture in the coastal population as well as a distinct social group known as the Akhdām, who perform menial tasks and are the closest thing to a caste in Yemen. In the far north there are still small remnants of the once-large Jewish communities (most migrated to Israel after 1948), while in the area of Aden and the eastern regions there are distinct Somali, Indonesian, and Indian elements in the population, legacies of the British colonial era as well of economic and political ties extending back over two millennia.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_835_YeQasmi] The intersection of low social status with the performance of 'impure' and subservient economic roles and the role of ethnicity in this process seem to justify coding this variable for the more hierarchical option. Furthermore, Jews were violently persecuted after the emergence of a Messianic movement. The codebook does not currently provide a category for status discrimination based on religion, but religion and ethnicity could be considered to intersect in the case of the Yemeni Jewish community. Tobi provides a historical description of repressive measures directed at Jews: 'In 1629 power in San'a was retaken by the native populalion after the Turks were driven out by the sons of the Zaydi Imam al-Qasim, who had firsl risen in revolt against them at the end of the previous century. While the Jews did not live at ease under Turkish rule, especially in its last years, as attested by Shalom Shabazi in his commentary to the Pentateuch liemdat Yamim,7 their lot deteriorated under the Zaydi yoke. The latter were religious fanatics and far stricter than the Sunni Ottomans (of the Hanafi school) in their treatment of Jews as ahl aidhimmah. 8 But to the religious facet was added the national facet, for the new Zaydi rulers accused the Jews of siding with the infidel Turks.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_836_YeQasmi] 'Religious ardour apparently intensified in particular under al-Qasim's son, the Imam Ism3'il al-Mutawakkil, who took power in 1644 and who was zealously religious. 'o Despite all the foregoing, there is no evidence whatever in the Jewish sources that at a certain date prior to the events associated with Shabbetay Zevi in 1667 acts of repression were carried out against the Jews of Yemen. On the other hand, according to various sources the latter expected the coming of the Messiah in the course of the seventeenth century, from the year 1619 on. This was connected with the appearance of two comets that year, according to Yisrael HaKohen of Qubayrah, the city of the priests in the Shar'ab province in southern Yemen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_837_YeQasmi] 'In the years immediately following 1619 the Jews of Yemen encountered great distress in the form of apostasy and incarceration and tonure at the hands of the Turkish rulers, worsened by the starvation resuhing from this and from a plague of locusts. Among the casualties were Yosef ben Avigad, Shabazi's father, and members of his family, as he relates in the sequel to the account of the comets in 1619. These harsh events were perceived as the birth-pangs preceding the advent of the Messiah, as indicated by the writing of zakharyah Ha-Zidoni, who in 1626 (1937 of the SE) expected the arrival of the Messiah in 1940 of the SE ("'In the year 1940 You shall accomplish vengeance") (a pun in Hebrew on the number of the year and the word for vengeance). That year was 1629, the year in which the Turks were driven out of San'a by the sons of al-Qasim, the Imam who rebelled against the foreign yoke.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_838_YeQasmi] 'The first information on Shabbetay Zevi reached Yemen very late, in 1666,30 when the Sabbatean movement was at its height and close to the time of the apocalypse expected that year.31 But it is noteworthy that at that time the advent of the Messiah was expected not only on the basis of this information and the omen of the two comets of 1619, since which time eighty years had not yet passed (see above), but also on the basis of another comet that had appeared in 1665. The only intimation of this is in one of the manuscripts of Shabazi's ll.emdat Yamim, in which the following appendage is found after the above account of the 1619 comelS: "In the year 1976 of Lht: SE a star arose before it like a flame and described a circle until it returned behind it; perhaps this is the star of the Messiah."' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_839_YeQasmi] 'Following the impression made by these events, but without any connection to&nbsp;!.hem, one year later-I 666--letters reached Yemen from Safed and Egypt. apparently Alexandria, telling of the approach of the end of days and of the Messiah Shabbetay Zevi.J ) Some of the letters from Egypt reached the heads of the San'a community-Yihye Ha-Levi, who was head of the court of justice at San'a, and Siayman alNaqqash, the leader of the community. h is not stated explicitly that they were sent to them, and it seems that they were handed over to them by Yemeni Jews. Many of the Jews of Yemen had been led to believe in the messianism of Shabbetay Zevi and the prophecy of Nathan Ha' Azzati, who are the only two figures of the Sabbatean movement to whom reference is made in the letters of the Yemeni sages, even though the heads of the community, in San'a at least, rejected the rumours of redemption:'4 Like Jewish communities outside Yemen, the excitement caused by the tales of Shabbetay Zevi resulted in the occurrence of soothsaying among the Jews in San'a and the neighbouring communities, and also in the communities of the south_ The soothsayers (even including some women), called "heralds" in the sources,35 conducted propaganda on behalf of Shabbetay Zevi and encouraged the Jews to perfonn purification rites and mortification for the coming of the Messiah: it was forbidden to eat meat other than roasted, to drink wine even on Passover eve, to shave the hair of the women's heads, and to engage in sexual intercourse; food was to be dipped in dust and ashes and not in salt, etc. These customs were elaborated by the Sahbateans in Yemen of their own accord. although they had read about the act of purification and mortification in the letters promoting the movement that had reached Vemen from abroad.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_840_YeQasmi] 'The Muslims in Yemen oppressed and humiliated the Jews, for which the author appeals to God thus: "Restore us against the tribula· tion and the torture and the humiliations that we have encountered in this exile" (p. 135). It seems that the oppression intensified after the Turks withdrew from Yemen in the 1630s. in particular under the rule of the zealous Imam al·Mut3wakkil Isma'il who ascended the throne in 1644: "Israel has borne several decrees and oppression and a large lax every month and all the days since the year DROR" (-541011650) (p.16). The straitened circumstances of the Yemeni ex.ile also become clear from the interpretation of the verse in Psalms 70:20: "In our exile we suffer from three calamities, the first is persecutions, wandering and slavery; the second is agony, poverty and humiliation; the third is war, abuse and famine" (p, 136), Moreover, from the author's vision of the future status of the Jews of Yemen following redemption something may be learned of their humiliation and resentment stemming from the special ta:&lt; they had to pay for protection by the Muslim ruler: "When the Messiah from the tribe of Ephrayim will appear [.,,] [in the year 5426 [1666J the [Arab] king [...] who was wandering in the desert [...] will distribule letters all over his kingdom 10 enhance the Jews [",] hoping to find reSI and peace and ease to his nation of the known nalion" (the Jews, p, 110), "The Lord will send a spirit in the tongue of every king and governor to announce in the markets and in the streets, saying: Peace. peace for Israel, they shall not pay any more mindah, bela and halakh06 (p. 138).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_841_YeQasmi] 'Elsewhere in the work it transpires that in fact during the rule of al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, cases of apostasy mulliplied under threat of persecution and by decree: these are the birth pangs of the Messiah and a hidden means of discovering if indeed there is complete repentance that will justify redemption (pp. 114-115).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_842_YeQasmi] 'We have observed above that the belief in Shabbetay Zevi in Yemen propagated mainly among the ordinary folk, while the leaders of the San'a community at least, the President Naqqash and the head of the rabbinical court Yihye Ha-Levi, were skeptical about i1.68 As we shall see below, these reservations on the part of these two, and apparently of other leaders in the San'a and other communities, are what saved them from the unnatural death that was the lot of Siayman Jamal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_843_YeQasmi] 'A contemporary Yemeni Muslim writer, 'Abd Allah ibn'Ali ibn al· Wazir, was the author of Iibtiq al-liulwti wa-Jihtif ai-Man wa·l-Salwa. Relating to the year 1077 of the Hijrah (beginning 4 July 1666), he sets out extremely important details on the messianic activity in Yemen that year.69 He states that it began in the month Rajab 1077 of the Hijrah, that is, January 1667. Presumably some time passed, at least several months, between the actual start of messianic activity in Yemen and the moment when the Muslims began to take note of it. The Muslim chronicle states, and this is borne out by what we know from the Hebrew sources, that the Jews sold their possessions cheaply and made preparations for their ascent to the Land of Israel, as the Messiah had been revealed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_844_YeQasmi] 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_845_YeQasmi] 'According to ibn al-Wazir, the stonn abated and the Imam took no funher steps against the Jews. But the Jews themselves, that is, those who held the messianic belief. exploited this time of calm and continued their messianic activity not only in secret but openly, There is no doubt that the official leaders of the San'a community did not participate, except for a certain group headed by one of its sages. The Muslim chronicler relates that in the course of a wine-drinking feast a member of this group became intoxicated and his companions dressed him in the finest garments. This may have been an indication of the messianic aspirations of that individual, as we shall see below. In any event, this man climbed up to the largest fortress of San'a, situated in the eastern outskirts of the city, and attempted to ascend to the throne and the canopy in the fortress, that is, to become ruler of the Muslims. He even made the outspoken demand that the Muslim commanders and soldiers in the fortress place themselves under his command. But instead the latter arrested the man and threw him into the Bustan prison in the city. The Imam was infonned of what had transpired. and he ordered the prisoner to be taken out and executed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_846_YeQasmi] 'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_847_YeQasmi] 'The leaders of the Jewish communities were arrested and tortured in several prisons, and the sentence of death hovered over lhem. As usual in cases of this kind in Yemen, Jews so sentenced were offered their lives in return for conversion to Islam;84 but the offer was rejected.l.S Naqqash, the nagid of the San'a community, was exiled to Qamaran86 in the Red Sea, a mostly deserted island populated by a few fishermen and a handful of villagers who made their living by pearl diving87 and which was used as a prison island for political offenders.88 He remained imprisoned and shackled for two years and only lhen was he released and returned to San'a.89 During the Mawza' exile, in 1679, he was still officiating as the nagid of the San'a community.90 It appears that his release was due to the fact that like other leaders of the San'a and other communities he had not supported the messianic move-ment in Yemen at that time.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_848_YeQasmi] 'In contrast to this the fate of Jamal was far more bitter. When called before the governor of San'a, not the Imam Isma'il in Sfidah, during the Passover festival in 1667, he apparently did not deny his messianic belief. After arrest and torture "in a place beneath the ground,,91 he was handed over to "a second king in whose hand he used to place the tax", probably the'Amil of San' a, who was in charge of collecting the jizyah tax from the Jews and who therefore bore responsibility for them, and he too "locked him in a place of snakes and scorpions". They sent from San'a to the Imam asking him what to do with Jamal, since in the Zaydi ruling hierarchy the Imam was considered the supreme judge. The latter ordered that he be executed as a rebel against the kingdom who had grievously violated the protection agreement between the Zaydi state and the Jews, although in the history of Yemen Jewry only few cases are known of execution of Jews by the ruler.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_849_YeQasmi] 'Only then, apparently before the release of Naqqash from Qamaran island, were the leaders of the Jewish communities held in SCidah freed, "after suffering and large ransom", as Hamami writes on the New Moon of Second Adar in 1980 SE (1669), but without mention of the release of Naqqash. According to Hibshush,'OO the Jewish leaders remained in prison "a whole year, until the ministers of the land saved them, speaking reassuring and favourable words to the king".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_850_YeQasmi] 'Various natural disasters, especially a severe drought. that struck Yemen in the years following the execution of Jamal reinforced the opinion among Ihe Muslims in Yemen that the country was being punished for the act. For their part the Jews worked 10 spread and estab· Iish this view. II was also reported that a certain Jewish leader lOl vowed to take Muslim property to compensate for what the Imam Isma'il had confiscated from the Jews. It is related that he actually did so by means of witchcraft that destroyed Muslim propeny and harmed their villages and fields. 102 From a Hebrew source at our disposal, a lament by Shelo~ mo ben Ho!er al_'Uzayri,IOJ we learn that the reference is to the serious drought that occurred in 1669 throughout Yemen. This calamity struck the Jews in panicular, not only on account of the economic structure of the country, in which they were chiefly anisans remote from farming, but also owing to their poverty resulting from the heavy fines imposed on them and the expropriation of their property two years previously. The government, as was its wont, exploited these terrible circumstances, and did not supply the Jews with grain from its stores unless they convened. And indeed, as Hamami,l04 "about five hundred or more of Israel altered their faith, and it was as the generation of apostasy owing to the poverty that was from the start and owing to the famine that visited the earth", 'Uzayri points out not only the great famine but also the wandering of the Jews from place (0 place in search of food, and the decrees imposed on them by the "kingdom of evil" precisely at the time of their woe.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_851_YeQasmi] 'Some attenuation in the acts of repression against the Jews seems to have taken place towards the end of the life of the Imam Isma'il. In 1084 of the Hijrah (beginning 18 April 1673), he decided to release the propeny of the Jews that had been taken from them six years before. However. he imposed other taxes on the Jews in addition to the jizyah. 'OS The death of 15m3'11 and the ascent to power of his nephew alMahdi Ahmad ibn Hasan sparked the hope among the Jews of Yemen that an end to their suffering had come at last. An expression of this is three poems written by Shabazi in honour of this imam. '06 For our purpose of importance is the third poem, in which Shabazi says (translation from Arabic): "[...J In the rule of Ahmad I travelled peacefully and securely. My song is ended and my words are sealed with greetings of peace, may it embrace the seed of the Imam; there is nothing beyond them except the Messiah".' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_852_YeQasmi] 'But the Jews of Yemen learned immediately that the cup of their suffering had not been filled by the execution, the imprisonment, the extra taxation, the fines, the confiscation of property and the discriminatory laws against them. The principal sources for this period are the Arabic chronicles and the legal opinions of the Muslim sages in Yemen regarding the settlement of the Jews in that country, as well as Shabazi's poems and Yihye Salin's Megillar Ternan. It emerges from Shabazi's poems107 that there was unremining pressure by the Zaydi government on the Jews to convert, and the Decree of the Orphans was renewed. lOB More important for the sUbject under review are the Arabic sources, because they reveal that the Imam Isma'il had already resolved to expel the Jews from Yemen, having concluded from the consequences of the messianic activity that their presence there was not beneficial for Islam and the Yemeni people. 109 The Qagi Shams ai-Islam Ahmad ibn ,Salin ibn abi al-Rijal writes in his opinion on the subject of the expulsion of the Jews thaI Isma'i1 commanded Ihis, and thaI in his own "holy scripl" he wrOle a will on his sickbed close 10 his death 1676, whose essence was Ihat the Jews of Yemen no longer enjoyed any protection by Ihe state and that it was obligatory to expel them from Yemen, Isma'il also willed thai no accounl be taken of any legal authorily, whoever he may be, who argued against the plain interpretation of Ihe hadirh allributed to Muhammad regarding the expulsion of the Jews from the Arabian Peninsula.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_853_YeQasmi] 'The Imam Isma'il therefore cited previous discussions on the settlement of the Jews in Yemen, and he wished to dismiss any interpretation that would permit their continued settlement. However, for various reasons, apparently economic in the main-the poverty of the country following the droughts-the heads of the Muslims from the family of the prophet Muhammad. the Sadah. succeeded in persuading Isma'il to act moderately, and at least (0 postpone the expulsion order for a certain period of time. Isma'il did not yield completely: although he gave up the idea of expulsion he requested the Muslim leaders who came to visit him during his illness to destroy the synagogues that had been built in Yemen; the intention was apparently those built after the rise of Islam; whose construction was forbidden in the terms of the protection.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_854_YeQasmi] 'Isma'il did not live to carry out what he desired, but his political testament was binding on his successor, Imam Ahmad. The latter, who like his predecessor was a great zaydi conqueror and expansionist, began to execute the will. On 28 September 1677 an order was sent by the Imam to the man who was eventually to inherit the crown of the imamate, Isma'il's son "Izz aI-Islam Muhammad,ll" on the expulsion of the Jews and the destruction of their synagogues. After giving the order he undertook discussions with the sages of Islam in San'a so as to win their support for the expulsion, which he then ascertained was a matter for controversy among the sages. On the other hand, all were agreed regarding the demolition of the synagogues. So that same year, 1677, the synagogue in San'a was locked up and those in the ai-Sawn area, northwest of San'a, were destroyed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_855_YeQasmi] 'Recently additional evidence has been published on the destruction of the synagogues in Yemen in those years, and this seems to indicate that these acts were restricted to the winter of 1678: "The razing of the synagogue of SUsan on the fourth day of the week which is third day of the year 1989 [SE-1678], and the enemie,s forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of law were slashed to pieces.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_856_YeQasmi] 'The consultations on the expulsion of the Jews were prolonged, the basic question being, as stated, if the prophet Muhammad had commanded the expulsion of the Jews from the entire Arabian Peninsula or from the Hijaz alone. liB Finally the Imam Ahmad resolved to implement the expulsion as a matter subject to the discretion of the ruler. as was the opinion of the Qadi ibn abi al_Rijal. l19 The 1ewish sources relate that the Jews were given the chance of converting to Islam in order to forestall the expulsion decree, an offer that they spumed, and that at first the intention was to deport them to the coast of Africa, beyond the Yemen borders. but through the intervention of Muslims close to the government the Imam Ahmad agreed to their expulsion to the Mawza' region in western Yemen near the pon of Mocha. And indeed, in 1679, about three years after Ahmad's succession, the Jews were expelled from all pans of Yemen to Mawza' _ Again, through the agency of the factors mentioned above, on account of the need for Jews in the country's economy as artisans and small traders, they were allowed to return from exile, albeit not to the same quarters and houses, but to new abodes near the cities yet outside the walls; the situation was similar regarding villages. l20 The construction of synagogues was no longer penniued and worship was conducted in private homes converted into prayer houses. In October 1679, after the Jews began their journey into exile, the Imam Ahmad ordered the doors of the San'a synagogue. which had been locked in 1676, to be opened; he took away the books and poured oul the wine kept in its storerooms. On the advice of ',Izz alIslam Muhammad ben Isma'i1 the synagogue was tom down, and in its stead a mosque was built, and given the name masjid al-jala' ("the mosque of the exile").'

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minūn) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_858_YeQasmi] In Yemen, wives were in a weaker legal position than husbands in the case of divorce: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women. Customarily, wives (through fathers or brothers) must remunerate their husbands if they wish to terminate the marriage. Legally, fathers' rights to the children after divorce supersede those of mothers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_859_YeQasmi] Veiling was common in the North: 'The traditional nature of Yemeni society is reflected in choices of attire, though the native dress of Yemen differs somewhat from that found in other conservative parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Men sometimes wear the full-length, loose-fitting thawb-frequently with a jacket over it-but more often the traditional fūṭah, a saronglike wraparound kilt, is worn with a shirt. The turban is a common type of head covering, and a finely woven bamboo hat (shaped somewhat like a fez) called a kofiya (or kofia) is a more formal choice of headgear. There are various forms of dress for women, depending on the social role a woman plays and where she lives. In North Yemen, women in cities and towns wore the sharsaf, a black skirt, scarf, and veil ensemble that covers the entire body. In South Yemen, the regime that succeeded the British after 1967 vigorously opposed this women's dress code, and this opposition prevailed especially in the towns and cities. In the countryside, clothing for women tends to be somewhat more utilitarian and may consist of a dress or robe that provides for a greater range of movement and under which, in some parts of Yemen, it is not uncommon for a woman to wear a pair of loose slacks known as a sirwāl. Also in the countryside, a woman's face may or may not be covered, and dresses are sometimes sewn from brightly coloured fabric. Working women frequently wear a broad-brimmed straw hat (dhola) to ward off the sun.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_860_YeQasmi] Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Women preside over the work of the household, which may be comprised of blood relatives, neighbors, and members of client or servant groups in families of high social status. Women are valued members of the household unit as agricultural producers and are also crucial to the maintenance of the Yemeni ideal of domestic hospitality.'

If they see someone practice ijtihiid in prayer, by lifting his hands or joining them on his chest or [tucking his feet beneath] his thighs, they condemn him for it, and violence has occurred on account of this. They get together and go to the mosques where one of the 'ulamii' is reading the books of Tradition and start fights there. (ibid.) This, he says, is the fault of shaytans among the learned men, who encourage factionalism.l" 'As for these brutish Arabs, most of them don't pray or fast or perform any of the duties of Islam .. .' (ibid.). This almost patrician disdain combines a particular Islamic rectitude with the conceptual geography of Yemen sketched in Chapter I; al-'Amri paraphrases al-Shawkani's view as follows: First there are those subjects (ra'iiyii) who come under the absolute control of the authority (dawlah) and submit to its orders. The majority of them cannot pray, or pray incorrectly.... He who does not practice prayer properly is a mere infidel . . . The second group consists of those of the far north and east (bilad alqiblah wa-l-mashriq) who have not come under the control of the dawlah. They are ... even worse, since they cannot read or write and they submit to the customary laws of their predecessors (a~kiim al-taghiit), instead of to the shari'ah . . . . Those who do so ... are unbelievers. The third group consists of the townspeople . . . As a result of their ignorance and indulgence, they neglect many of their duties towards God. However, they are quick and readier than others to learn and receive education; if resolved to do so. (al-'Amri 1985: 122) The northern tribes are thus the wolves beyond the walls (d. Gellner 198 I), the lack and the antithesis of a civilization whose centre. is San'a', In slightly later San'ani chronicles (al-Sayaghi 1978; al-Hibshi 1980) one is treated to a chorus of invective against these tribes-these 'followers of the taghut', 'dogs', murdererswho swirl around and sometimes plunder 'San'a' the protected of God' with no explicit reason but the Imamate's weakness and what seems their own inhe~ent wickedness.

It is a divine concession to the distressing reality of social disasters, such as war and the surplus of women it creates, and other circumstances, such as the chronic sickness of the first wife. This can make polygamy necessary and practicable as a prevention and solution of the social problems which these unfortunate events would otherwise create. When these circumstances do not exist, polygamy ceases to flourish and monogamy is, as now, the norm. Moreover, even in these conditions, there is a further requirement of equity or justice mentioned in the Qur’an: ‘if you fear that you cannot deal justly (‘’with so many’’), then one only’ (4:3). Furthermore, we read in the same chapter of the Qur’an: ‘You will never be able to deal equally between (‘’your’’) wives, however much you may desire (‘’to do so’’)’ (4:129).’” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_864_YeQasmi] 'Men may have as many as four wives at the same time, though in practice it is rare for a man to take more than one wife.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_867_YeQasmi] Generosity was valued: 'Looking back from the early twentieth century to the great days of the Qasimis, an anonymous chronicler paints a picture of righteous patronage (al-Hibshi 1980: 300-4): "The times smiled on the people of that age, and the reason was that all of Yemen was in the hand of the state: its ports, [Lower] Yemen, Raymah, 'Utmah, and everywhere, so fodder evengrewin the lands beyondBarat ... The first thing was that the Imam followed the pure shari'ah, even as it affected himself and what he owned. Then the Shaykh al-Islam was reverenced for executing affairs in accordance with God's Book and His Prophet's usage, and no-one accusedhim of taking evena pip or a pip-skin from the parties to a case. The reason for that was that he had a fief ... which paid not less than about 1,000 qadab ... and still had al-Haymah which paid about 100 silverpieces a month. Andeveryone he knewor was close to ate with him [i.e. lived off him], and he himselfsaved nothing of what he got. After him came the sayyids of the Imam's family ... After them came the ministers, five or six of them ... everyone of whom had limitless people living with him [i.e. off his largesse] ..." And so on through the ranks (all of them ad hoc; Zaydi theory says not a word of this organization), down through the servants of servants all claiming their bread, clothes, and money from someone above them, to the lists of the great's benefactions for poor people at the several festivals. A cataract of pious largesse; and the other half of the cycle (the question of income to support this expenditure) is nowhere addressed in detail.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_868_YeQasmi] 'So far as the tribes are concerned, this need not surprise us. The complement of segmentary equality is very often the gift min allah, from God, which therefore does not require reciprocity; indeed, the position of wealthy leaders in an egalitarian system is scarcely possible without this." But here the ethic of largesse permeated the whole functioning of the state, applying equally to townsfolk and traders, peasants and tribesmen, to everyone who wished for wealth. The lines of payment all ran normal to the axis of precise reciprocity which defines tribes or sections against their neighbours, and each line thus ran parallel to the others; their arrangement in an ordered series ('all of Yemen was in the hand of the state') depended solely on the Imam's 'prestige' (haybah). With or without such subordination, however, local lines of subsidy to this tribe or that persisted, and in practice this was a period at which a distinction was made clear which one finds still in documents very close to our own time: that between tribesmen (qabii'il) and peasants (ra'iyyah), 'subjects', people who pay tax.l" It was prominent shaykhs who formed the link between the two.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_869_YeQasmi] Dresch mentions charitable donations in times of famine: 'The structure of payments was that of the state itself. From the time of the Turks (1636) to that of al-Mahdi of al-Mawahib (1687) Yemen supposedly 'was spared hunger and strife, and that wealth was taken which the law permits'. (As we have seen, this is too rosy a view; but the perception is what concerns us.) 'When this man [alMawahib] arose he took what wealth is permitted and what is not permitted. His state grew strong, his prestige became great, his power expanded, the number of his troops increased, and he became more like a king than a caliph' (al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 298). Yet the control of such wealth from taxation was surely vital where the country's agricultural. base was so vulnerable; as in 1723-4, for instance, when "a drought struck San'a' and most of the mountains of Yemen. Most people (sic. akthar al-niis) died of hunger and the villages were emptied of their inhabitants ... People ate even carrion.

Shīʿites observe ʿĀshūrāʾ (commemorating the death of al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, the Prophet's grandson). The Day of National Unity is May 22, the day on which, in 1990, North Yemen and South Yemen were officially united. A number of other civil and religious holidays also are observed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_874_YeQasmi] The following account was taken from a modern-period source, but may hold true for the Qasimid period as well. Communal feasting was practiced on the occasion of major holidays: 'Now let us turn our attention to the two major religious festivals in he Muslim calendar: the 'id al-kabir after the holy month of fast, Ramadan, and the 'id as-saghir that marks the end of the annaual pilgrimage to Mecca. Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to observe only one of these festivals (at the end of Ramadan) while I was in Khawland, though I was assured by tribesmen that the same rituals were enacted in both. On the first morning after the fast had been officially declared at an end, the old and young adult males of the village in which I was staying convened in the selah (flood plain) to greet each other with salutations peculiar to the 'id. The flood plain has special significance. In the Yemeni highlands most villages are built on rock outcrops that jut upwards from the wadi floor, the fertile fields surrounding them irrigated by canals that drain the wadi's plain when it is in flood, during the rainy season twice a year. The rest of the time the wadi floor is dry and used for a variety of purposes, including the transport of animals, the passage of people between villages located along the plain, as the meeting ground for tribal delegations who have been sent to a village to mediate one of its disputes, and for open-air markets that convene once a week. A mosque is usually situated at the rim of the flood plain and the village, casting its sacred canopy over these people and their activities. In short, the flood plain is a general thoroughfare bringing fertility, religious blessing, and hopefully also security. It is not surprising that the religious festival marking the transition of the fast and the beginning of a new year is held in a place saturated with the symbolism of passage, for, as Van Gennep ([1908] 1960) understood, ritual time is often symbolized by movement in space. In the cool hours of early morning on the first day after the fast, the hamlet of Bet al-Bahluli sends a delegation of adult males to march in the wadi toward the hamlet of Dhu l-Mukh, which in turn dispatches a group of adult males toward the former, the two groups meeting halfway. At the head of the delegations are the servants of their respective hamlets, drumming the rhythms of the bara' dance. The men behind them chant a zamil poem appropriate to the religious occasion: "The month of Shawal for Arabs is proclaimed // As the time to break the fast for those who have fasted. Happy is the faster who has been loyal to [God's] demand, // And to those who have not -may they be damned!" "We have put our trust in God. // Our lot can only increase through His generosity. O Lord, let rainds give us (water) to drink // And irrigate the crops and fields." Again, the unmarried boys watch from the sidelines, the women from their houses. As soon as the two delegations stand facing each other a few yards apart, the elder of the first arrivals begins the greeting. "Peace, O tribesmen (lit, faces," he shouts in a high, creaky voice that rises above the din of the drumming and chanting as a signal for the crowd to be silent. The elder continues as before: "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy". The presupposition of this formula, of course, is that those addressed are true believers who have remained steadfast in Ramadan. As soon as the elder has finished, the men of the opposing delegation intone in unison the response. "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy. May He protect them [the rest of the tribe] from harm." A reception line is formed by the initial group, which now welcomes the new arrivals individually. Each man shakes the other's hand and quickly kisses the back of it, muttering min as-salimin (among the saved), a shibboleth among the community of the faithful. Smiling and laughing, the group now either prays in the mosque at the rim of the flood plain or else retires to an open-air site to hear a sermon about the significance of the 'id and then join in communal prayer. This activity may last a half hour, after which time they retire to their villages behind the drummers, once again chanting zamil poems. The next morning the villagers visit each other and perhaps exchange gifts, the children often skipping from door to door to receive candy; at noon relatives assemble for large communal feasts. Everyone is very much relieved that the hardship of the fast is finally over, though perhaps their joyous mood is also tinged with a slight anticlimactic feeling because the drama of self-discipline that marks the fast has ended.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_875_YeQasmi] Caton describes wedding celebrations. He does not mention feasts explicitly, but we have assumed that feasting was practiced during weddings: 'In the course of a wedding ceremony there are two crucial events in which zamil performances are the norm: the samrah and the groom's zaffah. The noun samrah is derived from the Arabic Form I verb samar, meaning to spend the evening with friends in restful, idle conversation. Tribesmen gather after dinner to sit and pass the time in someone's mafraj (sitting room), sometimes nearly until dawn, chatting, playing games, and perhaps even dancing. The groom's samrah is supposed to have the same elements of relaxed amusement, but it naturally differs in that the caliber of entertainment is much higher. Professional musicians, a drummer-singer and a flute player, are usually hired to perform the music to which the assembly can dance the mizmar (named after the flute), and all the adult guests are obligated to contribute some lines of verse in the competitive balah poetry or razfah. The excitement builds as the guests arrive in groups of about five to ten during the early evening hours. They are the ones referred to in the poetry as 'ajanib (foreigners). Their zamil poem echoes in the wadi basin in which they are walking and carries through the stillness of the night on high-pitched voices. Upon hearing their chant, the post of the samrah dispatches some young men to greet them at the village entrance with gun salutes and rounds of exploding firecrackers. The thoroughfare to the groom's house beckons in soft white light emanating from the garlands of bulbs strung across the house walls and is astir with children scurrying about and adults doing their rounds of visiting. There is no mistaking the groom's house, which is ablaze with lanterns, strings of bulbs, and torches. Its colored, stained-glass windows glow invitingly like embers in a hearth. The arrivals are conducted to the diwan (hall) in which the celebrants, including the groom, are waiting to receive them. [...] When the delegation has stepped into the room, the assembly rises to its feet to perform the moving ritual greeting known as hal. Room is then made in the already packed hall for the new arrivals. The most prestigious personages, such as sheikhs, are seated nearest the groom; the rest may sit anywhere on the circle according to their preference. Usually a soft, thick oriental carpet is spread under the celebrants for their comfort during the long hours of the groom's samrah; the water pipe is also available, the tobacco laced with the finest incense and the water delicately scented. Each male wears the Yemeni dagger (jambiyyah) -a curved silver blade with a gazelle-horn handle inlaid with old coins- and brings a rifle, which he hangs by its leather strap on the wall pegs. These weapons are symbolic of male fighting prowess and hence honor and the poetry is full of allusions to them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_876_YeQasmi]//'The groom has already changed into his brand-new set of clothes during the afternoon zaffah (procession). [...] Throughout the wedding ceremony the groom has to maintain a riding pose and does not participate in the event, such as the afternoon gat chews, the dancing, the poetry, or the shooting matches. He is a passive onlooker. Approximately one hour after the evening prayer, when the guests have been fed dinner, the professional musicians play a stirring drum salute called the tamsih, which incorporates in its music the rhythms of the famous bara' dance (see Adra 1982). This salute is a signal that the poetic events and dances of the evening are to begin. [...] Wedding celebrations may last several days, if not weeks, depending on the social prominence of the groom's family, and it is expected that the samrah be held on each evening of the celebration. On the lelat ad-dakhlak (night of consummation) the festivities reach their greatest intensity. Guests who cannot attend every night of the celebration try to attend at least that evening. Two genres of poetry are commonly performed at the samrah, the most important being a competitive verse composition known as the balah (the other being the dance-verse genre called the razfah). A wedding celebration is thought to be lacking if one or both of these genres is not performed; therefore, a special onus is placed on the guest to contribute in this way to the evening's entertainment. As for the zamil performance, I have already remarked that it occurs en route to the groom's village, but that is not the most crucial ceremony in which it is heard. Far more important is the groom's zaffah, the procession which begins at his house, slowly and majestically winds its way to the mosque, and then retraces its course. At the head of this procession are the village servants, who drum loudly the beat of the bara' dance. Immediately behind them are the guests of the wedding, all of them adult males, marching in columns with their rifles slung over their shoulders. They are wearing multicolored turbans, jackets, and skirts. They form what might be called the chorus of the zamil performance, one half chanting the first line of the poem and the other half chanting the second and final line; the poet usually comes from their ranks. If they feel so inclined, they might begin a dance to accompany the poetic chant and drum or shoot their files at an improvised target. All around them are the adolescent boys, too young to shoot off rifles or compose verse publicly, who gleefully light firecrackers and hurl them in the air to land usually underfoot or on the shoulders of the unsuspecting marchers, who cannot sidestep fast enough the flashing, hopping strings of fire. In the rear of the procession is the groom along with some friends or relatives bearing on their shoulders his mazharah or bouquet, which is composed of branches or acacia and sprigs of basil decjed with strings of different-colored berries, hollow eggs, and various other charms believed to ward off evil and bring good health, fertility, and prosperity. Sometimes a picture of the Haram Mosque in Mecca is stuck inside the bunch of plants, a reminder of the fundamentally sacred significance of the entire ceremony. As in the diwan, the groom is expected to maintain a solemn, dignified, and basically passive mien throughout the procession.//'Although  the women are not publicly present, they can be heard performing the peculiarly shrill ululation of joy (taghrid) from the house rooftops. Their black, veiled figures lean over the parapets four or more stories above the street, from where they throw candy to the children, who chase after these prizes through a haze of blue smoke rising from the exploding firecrackers. The whole affair is a cacophony of noise, a swirling mass of movement and color. The ideal of the poetic performance is that the guests compose a zamil to which the hosts respond; this exchange may be one of friendly teasing, or mutual recognition of honor expressed through praise and lofty compliments, of greeting, or of pious sentiments. The following is an example of such an exchange. First the host's poem: "From us good evening, [as many times as] the star revolves in the sky, // [As many times as] the rifle hits with its accurate bullets. O greeting to the guests, greetings from us all, // Which London announces and is broadcast in Iraq." The illocutionary force of the greeting is intensified by the metaphors of revolving heavenly bodies and the deadly accuracy of tribal marksmanship. Now the guest's poem: "Greetings from us. May thousands fill your mountains. // O defenders of the tribal border with the barrel of the rifle, We came from the same origins. // No one abandons his kinsmen until he dies." The guest poet returns the greeting with equal force and addresses the hosts as "defenders of the tribal border", meaning that they are therefore honorable men. Because the guest is a relative by marriage, he feels obligated to attend the wedding and affirms this obligation by declaring, "no one abandons his kinsmen until he dies.' The ideal of sociality understood as balanced exchange is upheld.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_877_YeQasmi] Khat parties were also important: 'Unquestionably the most important and distinctive social institution and form of recreation in Yemen is the khat party, or khat "chew." This is especially true in the northern part of the country, but, since the slight increase in general prosperity in the 1970s, the use of khat has spread to virtually all levels of Yemeni society. At least half of all men, and a smaller number of women, attend khat chews (which usually are segregated by gender) with some regularity, and many do so on a daily basis. Khat chews usually begin in the early afternoon after the main meal of the day, and they often go on until the early evening. Much gets done at these pleasurable sessions: gossip is exchanged, serious matters are discussed and debated, political and business decisions are made, business is transacted, disputes and grievances are settled, Yemeni history and lore are passed on, and music and poetry are played and recited.'

Often that violence was a response to efforts by early Muslims to curtail pre-Islamic forms of violence. Throughout human history, societal violence has been as prevalent as military violence, and in early seventh-century Arabia one finds numerous forms of societal violence. These included, for instance, female infanticide, along with the abuse of orphans, the poor, and marginal. Against such forms of societal violence, the revelations mediated through Muhammad were clear, incontrovertible challenges to the social order of tribal Mecca. For instance, they prohibit the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of female infanticide as well as other bodily and social abuses through directives set down, transmitted, and encoded in the Qur'an."

Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are.

The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff.

In rural Yemen, state authority is weak, and disputes between tribes are frequently solved through violence. The art of the feud is still quite real, and, as a consequence, Yemen is a gun culture. Virtually every household has at least one weapon, and men and boys often carry firearms in public. Even when not carrying a pistol or a rifle, most Yemeni males-particularly those belonging to a rural tribe-will carry a dagger, the traditional janbiyyah (or jambiyyah), a short, broad, curved blade sheathed on a belt worn across the abdomen and serving as a signal of one's status within social and tribal hierarchies."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_930_YeQasmi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Islamic criminal law recognizes three categories of wrongs punishable by the state: hudud crimes (sing. hadd; contravention of limits set by God), which lead to a prescribed and mandatory punishment; tazir (chastisement) crimes, involving discretionary punishment inflicted by the ruler; and qisas (retribution) crimes, concerned with injuries against the person such as homicide, infliction of wounds, and battery."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_931_YeQasmi] The following six actions count as hudud: "theft (amputation of the hand), illicit sexual relations (death by stoning or one hundred lashes), making unproven accusations of illicit sex (eighty lashes), drinking intoxicants (eighty lashes), apostasy (death or banishment), and highway robbery (death)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_932_YeQasmi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ present ♥</b> "Islamic criminal law recognizes three categories of wrongs punishable by the state: hudud crimes (sing. hadd; contravention of limits set by God), which lead to a prescribed and mandatory punishment; tazir (chastisement) crimes, involving discretionary punishment inflicted by the ruler; and qisas (retribution) crimes, concerned with injuries against the person such as homicide, infliction of wounds, and battery."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_933_YeQasmi][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Type of punishment this typically entailed (can be more than one):</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b> "Islamic criminal law recognizes three categories of wrongs punishable by the state: hudud crimes (sing. hadd; contravention of limits set by God), which lead to a prescribed and mandatory punishment; tazir (chastisement) crimes, involving discretionary punishment inflicted by the ruler; and qisas (retribution) crimes, concerned with injuries against the person such as homicide, infliction of wounds, and battery."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_934_YeQasmi] The following six actions count as hudud: "theft (amputation of the hand), illicit sexual relations (death by stoning or one hundred lashes), making unproven accusations of illicit sex (eighty lashes), drinking intoxicants (eighty lashes), apostasy (death or banishment), and highway robbery (death)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_935_YeQasmi]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ exile ♣ present ♥</b> For apostasy.

The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_944_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_945_YeQasmi] But taxation was contested: 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ... (al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_946_YeQasmi] Shaykhs also collected taxes and received 'protection money' from their respective fiefdoms: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_947_YeQasmi] 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_948_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183).

A more recently available, and more detailed, source gives a different impression (al-Hibshi 19 80: 29 6 ff.). But the Turks seem in any case to have had designs on the highlands: they had increased their forces on the coast 'until stores were coming ashore with San'a' printed on every load' (ibid. 315), and when they finally arrived, in 1872, they demanded the tax registers which would reveal to them the administration and resources of the whole country (al-Wasi'I 1928: IIO).

Yemen has a long tradition of irrigated terraced agriculture, although most land was under dry cultivation: 'Yemen’s difficult terrain, limited soil, inconsistent water supply, and large number of microclimates have fostered some of the most highly sophisticated methods of water conservation and seed adaptation found anywhere in the world, making possible the cultivation of surprisingly diverse crops. The most common crops are cereals such as millet, corn (maize), wheat, barley, and sorghum; myriad vegetables from a burgeoning truck farm industry have appeared on the market in recent years. There has also been extensive cultivation of fruits-both tropical (mangoes, plantains, bananas, melons, papayas, and citrus) and temperate (pears, peaches, apples, and grapes).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_973_YeQasmi] However, irrigation facilities were constructed by local communities, not the state (see agriculture variables).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ provision of irrigation works ♣ non-state ♥</b> See above.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Health infrastructure ♣ absent ♥</b> 'Folk' healers were common: 'Yemenis often continue to rely on traditional healers and midwives while simultaneously taking advantage of modern medical technologies.

The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_975_YeQasmi] 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_976_YeQasmi] But taxation was contested: 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ... (al]iriifi 1951: 181, trans. Stookey 1978: 151-2).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_977_YeQasmi] Shaykhs also collected taxes and received 'protection money' from their respective fiefdoms: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_978_YeQasmi] 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_979_YeQasmi] 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_980_YeQasmi] 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_981_YeQasmi] Imams also paid 'stipends' to shaykhs: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.'

Caton provides a description of 'Id al-kabir celebrations: 'Now let us turn our attention to the two major religious festivals in he Muslim calendar: the 'id al-kabir after the holy month of fast, Ramadan, and the 'id as-saghir that marks the end of the annaual pilgrimage to Mecca. Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to observe only one of these festivals (at the end of Ramadan) while I was in Khawland, though I was assured by tribesmen that the same rituals were enacted in both. On the first morning after the fast had been officially declared at an end, the old and young adult males of the village in which I was staying convened in the selah (flood plain) to greet each other with salutations peculiar to the 'id. The flood plain has special significance. In the Yemeni highlands most villages are built on rock outcrops that jut upwards from the wadi floor, the fertile fields surrounding them irrigated by canals that drain the wadi's plain when it is in flood, during the rainy season twice a year. The rest of the time the wadi floor is dry and used for a variety of purposes, including the transport of animals, the passage of people between villages located along the plain, as the meeting ground for tribal delegations who have been sent to a village to mediate one of its disputes, and for open-air markets that convene once a week. A mosque is usually situated at the rim of the flood plain and the village, casting its sacred canopy over these people and their activities. In short, the flood plain is a general thoroughfare bringing fertility, religious blessing, and hopefully also security. It is not surprising that the religious festival marking the transition of the fast and the beginning of a new year is held in a place saturated with the symbolism of passage, for, as Van Gennep ([1908] 1960) understood, ritual time is often symbolized by movement in space. In the cool hours of early morning on the first day after the fast, the hamlet of Bet al-Bahluli sends a delegation of adult males to march in the wadi toward the hamlet of Dhu l-Mukh, which in turn dispatches a group of adult males toward the former, the two groups meeting halfway. At the head of the delegations are the servants of their respective hamlets, drumming the rhythms of the bara' dance. The men behind them chant a zamil poem appropriate to the religious occasion: "The month of Shawal for Arabs is proclaimed // As the time to break the fast for those who have fasted. Happy is the faster who has been loyal to [God's] demand, // And to those who have not -may they be damned!" "We have put our trust in God. // Our lot can only increase through His generosity. O Lord, let rainds give us (water) to drink // And irrigate the crops and fields." Again, the unmarried boys watch from the sidelines, the women from their houses. As soon as the two delegations stand facing each other a few yards apart, the elder of the first arrivals begins the greeting. "Peace, O tribesmen (lit, faces," he shouts in a high, creaky voice that rises above the din of the drumming and chanting as a signal for the crowd to be silent. The elder continues as before: "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy". The presupposition of this formula, of course, is that those addressed are true believers who have remained steadfast in Ramadan. As soon as the elder has finished, the men of the opposing delegation intone in unison the response. "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy. May He protect them [the rest of the tribe] from harm." A reception line is formed by the initial group, which now welcomes the new arrivals individually. Each man shakes the other's hand and quickly kisses the back of it, muttering min as-salimin (among the saved), a shibboleth among the community of the faithful. Smiling and laughing, the group now either prays in the mosque at the rim of the flood plain or else retires to an open-air site to hear a sermon about the significance of the 'id and then join in communal prayer. This activity may last a half hour, after which time they retire to their villages behind the drummers, once again chanting zamil poems. The next morning the villagers visit each other and perhaps exchange gifts, the children often skipping from door to door to receive candy; at noon relatives assemble for large communal feasts. Everyone is very much relieved that the hardship of the fast is finally over, though perhaps their joyous mood is also tinged with a slight anticlimactic feeling because the drama of self-discipline that marks the fast has ended.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_983_YeQasmi] He also mentions wedding celebrations: 'In the course of a wedding ceremony there are two crucial events in which zamil performances are the norm: the samrah and the groom's zaffah. The noun samrah is derived from the Arabic Form I verb samar, meaning to spend the evening with friends in restful, idle conversation. Tribesmen gather after dinner to sit and pass the time in someone's mafraj (sitting room), sometimes nearly until dawn, chatting, playing games, and perhaps even dancing. The groom's samrah is supposed to have the same elements of relaxed amusement, but it naturally differs in that the caliber of entertainment is much higher. Professional musicians, a drummer-singer and a flute player, are usually hired to perform the music to which the assembly can dance the mizmar (named after the flute), and all the adult guests are obligated to contribute some lines of verse in the competitive balah poetry or razfah. The excitement builds as the guests arrive in groups of about five to ten during the early evening hours. They are the ones referred to in the poetry as 'ajanib (foreigners). Their zamil poem echoes in the wadi basin in which they are walking and carries through the stillness of the night on high-pitched voices. Upon hearing their chant, the post of the samrah dispatches some young men to greet them at the village entrance with gun salutes and rounds of exploding firecrackers. The thoroughfare to the groom's house beckons in soft white light emanating from the garlands of bulbs strung across the house walls and is astir with children scurrying about and adults doing their rounds of visiting. There is no mistaking the groom's house, which is ablaze with lanterns, strings of bulbs, and torches. Its colored, stained-glass windows glow invitingly like embers in a hearth. The arrivals are conducted to the diwan (hall) in which the celebrants, including the groom, are waiting to receive them. [...] When the delegation has stepped into the room, the assembly rises to its feet to perform the moving ritual greeting known as hal. Room is then made in the already packed hall for the new arrivals. The most prestigious personages, such as sheikhs, are seated nearest the groom; the rest may sit anywhere on the circle according to their preference. Usually a soft, thick oriental carpet is spread under the celebrants for their comfort during the long hours of the groom's samrah; the water pipe is also available, the tobacco laced with the finest incense and the water delicately scented. Each male wears the Yemeni dagger (jambiyyah) -a curved silver blade with a gazelle-horn handle inlaid with old coins- and brings a rifle, which he hangs by its leather strap on the wall pegs. These weapons are symbolic of male fighting prowess and hence honor and the poetry is full of allusions to them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_984_YeQasmi]//'The groom has already changed into his brand-new set of clothes during the afternoon zaffah (procession). [...] Throughout the wedding ceremony the groom has to maintain a riding pose and does not participate in the event, such as the afternoon gat chews, the dancing, the poetry, or the shooting matches. He is a passive onlooker. Approximately one hour after the evening prayer, when the guests have been fed dinner, the professional musicians play a stirring drum salute called the tamsih, which incorporates in its music the rhythms of the famous bara' dance (see Adra 1982). This salute is a signal that the poetic events and dances of the evening are to begin. [...] Wedding celebrations may last several days, if not weeks, depending on the social prominence of the groom's family, and it is expected that the samrah be held on each evening of the celebration. On the lelat ad-dakhlak (night of consummation) the festivities reach their greatest intensity. Guests who cannot attend every night of the celebration try to attend at least that evening. Two genres of poetry are commonly performed at the samrah, the most important being a competitive verse composition known as the balah (the other being the dance-verse genre called the razfah). A wedding celebration is thought to be lacking if one or both of these genres is not performed; therefore, a special onus is placed on the guest to contribute in this way to the evening's entertainment. As for the zamil performance, I have already remarked that it occurs en route to the groom's village, but that is not the most crucial ceremony in which it is heard. Far more important is the groom's zaffah, the procession which begins at his house, slowly and majestically winds its way to the mosque, and then retraces its course. At the head of this procession are the village servants, who drum loudly the beat of the bara' dance. Immediately behind them are the guests of the wedding, all of them adult males, marching in columns with their rifles slung over their shoulders. They are wearing multicolored turbans, jackets, and skirts. They form what might be called the chorus of the zamil performance, one half chanting the first line of the poem and the other half chanting the second and final line; the poet usually comes from their ranks. If they feel so inclined, they might begin a dance to accompany the poetic chant and drum or shoot their files at an improvised target. All around them are the adolescent boys, too young to shoot off rifles or compose verse publicly, who gleefully light firecrackers and hurl them in the air to land usually underfoot or on the shoulders of the unsuspecting marchers, who cannot sidestep fast enough the flashing, hopping strings of fire. In the rear of the procession is the groom along with some friends or relatives bearing on their shoulders his mazharah or bouquet, which is composed of branches or acacia and sprigs of basil decjed with strings of different-colored berries, hollow eggs, and various other charms believed to ward off evil and bring good health, fertility, and prosperity. Sometimes a picture of the Haram Mosque in Mecca is stuck inside the bunch of plants, a reminder of the fundamentally sacred significance of the entire ceremony. As in the diwan, the groom is expected to maintain a solemn, dignified, and basically passive mien throughout the procession.//'Although  the women are not publicly present, they can be heard performing the peculiarly shrill ululation of joy (taghrid) from the house rooftops. Their black, veiled figures lean over the parapets four or more stories above the street, from where they throw candy to the children, who chase after these prizes through a haze of blue smoke rising from the exploding firecrackers. The whole affair is a cacophony of noise, a swirling mass of movement and color. The ideal of the poetic performance is that the guests compose a zamil to which the hosts respond; this exchange may be one of friendly teasing, or mutual recognition of honor expressed through praise and lofty compliments, of greeting, or of pious sentiments. The following is an example of such an exchange. First the host's poem: "From us good evening, [as many times as] the star revolves in the sky, // [As many times as] the rifle hits with its accurate bullets. O greeting to the guests, greetings from us all, // Which London announces and is broadcast in Iraq." The illocutionary force of the greeting is intensified by the metaphors of revolving heavenly bodies and the deadly accuracy of tribal marksmanship. Now the guest's poem: "Greetings from us. May thousands fill your mountains. // O defenders of the tribal border with the barrel of the rifle, We came from the same origins. // No one abandons his kinsmen until he dies." The guest poet returns the greeting with equal force and addresses the hosts as "defenders of the tribal border", meaning that they are therefore honorable men. Because the guest is a relative by marriage, he feels obligated to attend the wedding and affirms this obligation by declaring, "no one abandons his kinsmen until he dies.' The ideal of sociality understood as balanced exchange is upheld.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_985_YeQasmi]// Caton's material focuses on the performance of poetry: 'A small group of men -approximately six to ten in the average performance- form a circle (halgah) in the middle of the room. They face inward, their arms clasped around each other's shoulders or waists and their feet slowly moving in a simple side step (clockwise or counterclockwise; the direction of movement does not seem to matter). This circle of men is what I call a chorus, though in Arabuc they are referred to as saffen, literally two ranks (lines or groups). One rank or saff chants a refrain, and the other chants a certain part of the verse, the two groups thus alternating their canting throughout the performance of a single poem. The choristers are often the younger men of the wedding party, sometimes even adolescents, who may not yet possess the requisite skill to compose verse but are learning it by performing in the chorus. The poets, whoever they turn out to bem shut their eyes as they listen to the chanting, their faces tense with the effort of composition, their lips silently forming the lines that spring from their imagination. Confident that they have composed a well-formed verse, their faces brighten, and one among their number (which varies from two to five or even more) moves decisively toward the circle and breaks through the linked arms of the choristers, who close ranks behind him. The poet is now in the center of the performance, in the middle of the samrah, and at the heart of the wedding festivities. The collective attends the individual's chant to see how well he plays the game. Cupping one or both hands to the sides of his head, sometimes even plugging his ears with his thumbs [...] -a gesture that simultaneously projects the verse off a natural sounding board so that the whole noisy assembly can hear it and blocks out any palaver that might disturb his concentration (conindicentally this attitude is reminiscent of the mu'adhdhin, who calls the people to prayer)- he walks half of the circle's circumference and at the same time chants the first hermistich (harf) of his turn. Depending on the particular chant, the chorus might introduce at this juncture with a choral refrain, but in any case the power finishes his turn by chanting the second menistich and continuing around to close the circle. (In the case of a third hemistich, which rarely occurs, he describes another half-circle). He then immediately exits from the middle of the circle, and the chorus meanwhile picks up the chanting of the last hemistich of the poet's turn, alternating it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building the poem. The performance ought not to depend heavily on the contributions of one person, for the nit is no longer felt to be an evenly matched competition. Throughout the performance the audience is hardly ever still, except when a poet enters the circle, at which time most people want to hear what he has to say and evaluate it. They are quick to laugh at a witty line or exclaim allahu akbar (God is great) in reaction to a particularly good metaphor or adroit turn of phrase. If the poet'S gift to the groom is unsound because it breaks the rules of composition, they will start shouting boisterously harf magsus (a broken hemistich). Occasionally such rowdy criticism incites a quarrel between the poet and his audience, but he his more likely to amend the fault by quickly fashioning another hemistich. If he cannot make a speedy recovery, he will inevitably give to another poet and thereby lose face. As soon as the poet has exited the circle and the chorus has begun chanting again, the audience usually attends to its own matters -resuming a conversation, smoking the water pipe, joking, or just dozing to the hypnotic drone of the chant.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_986_YeQasmi]//'To summarize, the performance is made up of three concentric circles: the inner one is described by the poet's turn, the middle one comprises the chorus, and the outer one is formed by the seated audience. The penetration of the inner circle by the poet emerging from the outer two and then the exiting back into them is perfectly iconic of the ideal that everyone -whether a member of the audience or the chorus- may be a poet; no one is privileged. In addition, and much more significant, is the fact that the closer someone is to the center, the more intimately he becomes involved in the compositional process: the audience react to the poem, the chorus "carries" it (the Arabic word is shall, which means lift or carry), and the poet composes it. And whereas the audience and chorus look inward, the poet faces them in the middle by looking outward: the individual is alone and being judged by the collectivity. It is certainly the ultimate moment of truth, when honor is being tested and is either recognized or repudiated.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_987_YeQasmi] 'Each genre of performance-composed poetry (balah, zamil, razfah, and roshan) has its own set of melodies on which the poetry is chanted.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_988_YeQasmi] It appears from the above descriptions that festivals were organized by local communities rather than 'publicly' funded. This is in need of confirmation and more material is needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Entertainment buildings ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Theatres ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Arenas ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ritual buildings/spaces ♣ present ♥</b> Mosques served as primary ceremonial sites: 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning. Men gather at the mosque for prayers and sermons on the Sabbath, which in Yemen occurs on Friday. Strict segregation of the sexes usually does not permit women to worship in public.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_989_YeQasmi] 'Despite the imposition of modernity, Yemenis remain proud of their architectural and oral-poetry traditions.

In the rural highlands, houses constructed atop terraced embankments were fortresses against enemy tribes. In cities along the coastal plain, the former elegance of houses and mosques can be seen in their elaborate doors and facades. Rural towns in the Tihama usually include a walled compound that contains mud and thatched-roof huts identical to those found in Africa, on the other side of the Red Sea. The interiors of Tihama houses may be highly ornamented. Buildings constructed of cinder blocks are routinely replacing the huts. Competitive poetry duels performed at weddings by men of tribal status are highly valued. In the past, celebrations for circumcision (required of all Muslim males) were particularly elaborate, but now government officials discourage postinfancy circumcisions, thereby undermining the importance of ceremonial specialists.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_990_YeQasmi] The adherents of some of Yemen's Islamic sects also visited the tombs of saints: 'Islam is the major force that unifies Yemenis across social, sexual, and regional boundaries. Yet most adherents of the different schools of Islam reside in distinct sections of the country, and this fact has certain political implications. Zaydis, who belong to the Shia subsect of Islam, are located in the northern and eastern parts of Yemen, whereas Shafis, orthodox Sunnis, live in the southern and coastal regions. Location in the highlands apparently enables Zaydis more successfully to repel invasions than Shafis in the lower lying areas. A smaller Shia subsect, the Ismaili, and also the remnants of an ancient Jewish community, may still be found in certain parts of Yemen. As Muslims, Yemenis aspire to fulfill the five tenets of Islam: affirmation of the Islamic creed, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage. In the Shafi areas of Yemen, the tombs of certain holy men are visited by believers for their special healing and other powers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_991_YeQasmi] The Qasimids had mosques constructed: 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_994_YeQasmi] Poetry was popular: 'The most widespread and traditional cultural outlet is oral, in the form of proverbs, popular stories, and poetry; poems that deal with timeless themes such as love and death as well as with Yemeni history, biography, and Islamic themes and traditions are particularly prevalent. Yemen is an integral part of contemporary Arab trends in literature, political essays, and scholarly writing; Yemeni poets, past and present, are among the most esteemed in the Arab world. Among these are the great 10th-century poet and historian al-Hamdānī and such modern writers as novelist Zayd Muṭīʿ Dammāj, poet and political chronicler ʿAbd Allāh al-Baraddūnī, and the prolific poet ʿAbd al-Azīz al-Maqāliḥ. Similarly, the songs and singers of Yemen are highly respected, and some Yemeni instruments (such as the lutelike qanbus, or ṭurbī, now largely replaced by the ʿūd) and genres (such as al-ghināʾ al-ṣanʿānī, or Sanaani song) are quite unique.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_995_YeQasmi] But it appeared that most poetry was performed by community members rather than entertainment specialists: 'A small group of men -approximately six to ten in the average performance- form a circle (halgah) in the middle of the room. They face inward, their arms clasped around each other's shoulders or waists and their feet slowly moving in a simple side step (clockwise or counterclockwise; the direction of movement does not seem to matter). This circle of men is what I call a chorus, though in Arabuc they are referred to as saffen, literally two ranks (lines or groups). One rank or saff chants a refrain, and the other chants a certain part of the verse, the two groups thus alternating their canting throughout the performance of a single poem. The choristers are often the younger men of the wedding party, sometimes even adolescents, who may not yet possess the requisite skill to compose verse but are learning it by performing in the chorus. The poets, whoever they turn out to bem shut their eyes as they listen to the chanting, their faces tense with the effort of composition, their lips silently forming the lines that spring from their imagination. Confident that they have composed a well-formed verse, their faces brighten, and one among their number (which varies from two to five or even more) moves decisively toward the circle and breaks through the linked arms of the choristers, who close ranks behind him. The poet is now in the center of the performance, in the middle of the samrah, and at the heart of the wedding festivities. The collective attends the individual's chant to see how well he plays the game. Cupping one or both hands to the sides of his head, sometimes even plugging his ears with his thumbs [...] -a gesture that simultaneously projects the verse off a natural sounding board so that the whole noisy assembly can hear it and blocks out any palaver that might disturb his concentration (conindicentally this attitude is reminiscent of the mu'adhdhin, who calls the people to prayer)- he walks half of the circle's circumference and at the same time chants the first hermistich (harf) of his turn. Depending on the particular chant, the chorus might introduce at this juncture with a choral refrain, but in any case the power finishes his turn by chanting the second menistich and continuing around to close the circle. (In the case of a third hemistich, which rarely occurs, he describes another half-circle). He then immediately exits from the middle of the circle, and the chorus meanwhile picks up the chanting of the last hemistich of the poet's turn, alternating it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building the poem. The performance ought not to depend heavily on the contributions of one person, for the nit is no longer felt to be an evenly matched competition. Throughout the performance the audience is hardly ever still, except when a poet enters the circle, at which time most people want to hear what he has to say and evaluate it. They are quick to laugh at a witty line or exclaim allahu akbar (God is great) in reaction to a particularly good metaphor or adroit turn of phrase. If the poet'S gift to the groom is unsound because it breaks the rules of composition, they will start shouting boisterously harf magsus (a broken hemistich). Occasionally such rowdy criticism incites a quarrel between the poet and his audience, but he his more likely to amend the fault by quickly fashioning another hemistich. If he cannot make a speedy recovery, he will inevitably give to another poet and thereby lose face. As soon as the poet has exited the circle and the chorus has begun chanting again, the audience usually attends to its own matters -resuming a conversation, smoking the water pipe, joking, or just dozing to the hypnotic drone of the chant.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_996_YeQasmi]//'To summarize, the performance is made up of three concentric circles: the inner one is described by the poet's turn, the middle one comprises the chorus, and the outer one is formed by the seated audience. The penetration of the inner circle by the poet emerging from the outer two and then the exiting back into them is perfectly iconic of the ideal that everyone -whether a member of the audience or the chorus- may be a poet; no one is privileged. In addition, and much more significant, is the fact that the closer someone is to the center, the more intimately he becomes involved in the compositional process: the audience react to the poem, the chorus "carries" it (the Arabic word is shall, which means lift or carry), and the poet composes it. And whereas the audience and chorus look inward, the poet faces them in the middle by looking outward: the individual is alone and being judged by the collectivity. It is certainly the ultimate moment of truth, when honor is being tested and is either recognized or repudiated.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_997_YeQasmi] 'Each genre of performance-composed poetry (balah, zamil, razfah, and roshan) has its own set of melodies on which the poetry is chanted.'

And so on through the ranks (all of them ad hoc; Zaydi theory says not a word of this organization), down through the servants of servants all claiming their bread, clothes, and money from someone above them, to the lists of the great's benefactions for poor people at the several festivals.

The complement of segmentary equality is very often the gift min allah, from God, which therefore does not require reciprocity; indeed, the position of wealthy leaders in an egalitarian system is scarcely possible without this." But here the ethic of largesse permeated the whole functioning of the state, applying equally to townsfolk and traders, peasants and tribesmen, to everyone who wished for wealth. The lines of payment all ran normal to the axis of precise reciprocity which defines tribes or sections against their neighbours, and each line thus ran parallel to the others; their arrangement in an ordered series ('all of Yemen was in the hand of the state') depended solely on the Imam's 'prestige' (haybah). With or without such subordination, however, local lines of subsidy to this tribe or that persisted, and in practice this was a period at which a distinction was made clear which one finds still in documents very close to our own time: that between tribesmen (qabii'il) and peasants (ra'iyyah), 'subjects', people who pay tax.l" It was prominent shaykhs who formed the link between the two.' <sup id="cite_ref-1007" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1007">[1,007]</a></sup> Dresch mentions charitable donations in times of famine: 'The structure of payments was that of the state itself.

The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' <sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup> 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1011" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1011">[1,011]</a></sup> But taxation was contested: 'Al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim then took the Imamate (Serjeant 1983: 84), and at this stage al-Ahmar was apparently on good terms with al-Husayn, the new Imam's son (Zabarah 1941: 539); but when alNasir Muhammad made a rival claim in 1723 al-Ahrnar and many other shaykhs went over to him. The leading sayyids were meanwhile divided among themselves over the perennial problem of taxation (ibid. 289). In 1726 the Dhayban section of Arhab cut the roads, and a group of them made trouble in San'a' itself (Zabarah 1958: 359). The Imam had them hunted through the streets, in response to which "Arhab tribesmen invited Hashid and Bakil to join them in taking revenge and wiping out the dishonour they had sustained. The tribes responded. 'All b. Qasim al-Ahmar, Paramount Shaykh of Hashid, and Nasir b. juzaylan, Paramount Shaykh of Bakil, proceeded to 'Amran where they met al-Husayn, the Imam's son, whom they persuaded to join them ...

Stookey 1978: 151-2).' <sup id="cite_ref-1012" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1012">[1,012]</a></sup> Shaykhs also collected taxes and received 'protection money' from their respective fiefdoms: 'At precisely this period, and in the space of a decade, the names of several great shaykhly families important nowadays all appear for the first time: al-Ahmar of Hashid, for instance, juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad, ani Hubaysh of Sufyan, Some of the lesser shaykhly houses, such as al-Ziyadi, al-Rarnmah, 'Irnran, ~lGhashrni, and al-Barawi, are attested as much as a century earlier (see e.g, Nubdhah: III, 121, 123, 175, 453). Many of the tribal divisions familiar nowadays had been present far longer, as readers will have gathered from Chapter 5, but the leading families now identified with them appear only at this later date. They were associated with the state and with events elsewhere than in tribal territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-1013" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1013">[1,013]</a></sup> 'Whatever setbacks they suffered, however, Bayt al-Ahmar were not displaced permanently. In the year after Abu 'Alamah's rising, when the Sharif of Abu 'Arish and a rival claimant to the Imamate were active in the north-west, they were again a power to be reckoned with." Certainly they collected taxes as well as rents in the nineteenth century, and local memory credits them with taking revenue even from coastal towns in the north Tihamah, They retain considerable lands in the west to the present day.' <sup id="cite_ref-1014" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1014">[1,014]</a></sup> 'Nor were Bayt al-Ahrnar of Hashid the only shaykhly family in the area: Nasir juzaylan of Dhu Muhammad lost forts to Abu 'Alamah at al-Masiih, and a garrison from Dhii Husayn were chased out of al-Sha'iq in Bani 'Awam (again near Hajjah), but the shaykhly families of Barat retained or re-established a hold there. Al al-Shayif of Dhfi Husayn, for example, still own land in Hajjah province, and Bayt Hubaysh of Sufyan have considerable holdings near al-Mahwit (Tutwiler 1987). The picture which emerges between the lines of eighteenth-century histories and tariijim is of myriad forts in the western mountains, each garrisoned by twenty or thirty tribal soldiers and controlling an area for some shaykh of the northern plateau. As the eighteenth century wears on, so the same pattern comes more clearly to light in Lower Yemen too: in his entry for 1752, for example, al-jirafi records for the first time what will punctuate his history thereafter, Barat tribesmen at odds with the Imam south of San'a' (al-jirafi 195I: 183). They continued to appear there into the present century, leaving behind great numbers of tribal families and large shaykhly holdings of land outside tribal territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-1015" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1015">[1,015]</a></sup> 'These shaykhs are not the subject of Imamic history. Although the Imamate could not have functioned as it did without them, and although the granting of 'fiefs' to them went on for centuries, the details of their financial and administrative position are nowhere written up. Nor has local documentation come to light. Until it does, we must form what estimate we can by looking at the great shaykhly houses nowadays.' <sup id="cite_ref-1016" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1016">[1,016]</a></sup> Imams also paid 'stipends' to shaykhs: 'Hasan al-'Ansi and the Barat tribes appeared outside San'a' in 1770. They were successfully driven off, which provoked some vainglorious poetry from the victors (Serjeant 1983: 86; d. alShawkani 1929: i. 459), but elsewhere al-Shawkani suggests (ibid. ii. 136) how this was achieved: an addition to the tribesmen's stipend of 20,000 riyals per annum, the implication being that they already received regular payment. These incursions and payments continued for several decades.P and the Barat tribes remained active in Lower Yemen until the Turks took the area in the late nineteenth century.' <sup id="cite_ref-1017" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1017">[1,017]</a></sup> As a religious minority, Jews were compelled to a pay a head tax: 'The Muslims in Yemen oppressed and humiliated the Jews, for which the author appeals to God thus: "Restore us against the tribula· tion and the torture and the humiliations that we have encountered in this exile" (p. 135). It seems that the oppression intensified after the Turks withdrew from Yemen in the 1630s. in particular under the rule of the zealous Imam al·Mut3wakkil Isma'il who ascended the throne in 1644: "Israel has borne several decrees and oppression and a large lax every month and all the days since the year DROR" (-541011650) (p.116). The straitened circumstances of the Yemeni ex.ile also become clear from the interpretation of the verse in Psalms 70:20: "In our exile we suffer from three calamities, the first is persecutions, wandering and slavery; the second is agony, poverty and humiliation; the third is war, abuse and famine" (p, 136), Moreover, from the author's vision of the future status of the Jews of Yemen following redemption something may be learned of their humiliation and resentment stemming from the special ta:&lt; they had to pay for protection by the Muslim ruler: "When the Messiah from the tribe of Ephrayim will appear [.,,] [in the year 5426 [1666J the [Arab] king [...] who was wandering in the desert [...] will distribule letters all over his kingdom 10 enhance the Jews [",] hoping to find reSI and peace and ease to his nation of the known nalion" (the Jews, p, 110), "The Lord will send a spirit in the tongue of every king and governor to announce in the markets and in the streets, saying: Peace. peace for Israel, they shall not pay any more mindah, bela and halakh06 (p. 138).' <sup id="cite_ref-1018" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1018">[1,018]</a></sup> Special decrees were made against Yemeni Jews in response to a Messianic movement: 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' <sup id="cite_ref-1019" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1019">[1,019]</a></sup> 'According to ibn al-Wazir, the stonn abated and the Imam took no funher steps against the Jews. But the Jews themselves, that is, those who held the messianic belief. exploited this time of calm and continued their messianic activity not only in secret but openly, There is no doubt that the official leaders of the San'a community did not participate, except for a certain group headed by one of its sages. The Muslim chronicler relates that in the course of a wine-drinking feast a member of this group became intoxicated and his companions dressed him in the finest garments. This may have been an indication of the messianic aspirations of that individual, as we shall see below. In any event, this man climbed up to the largest fortress of San'a, situated in the eastern outskirts of the city, and attempted to ascend to the throne and the canopy in the fortress, that is, to become ruler of the Muslims. He even made the outspoken demand that the Muslim commanders and soldiers in the fortress place themselves under his command. But instead the latter arrested the man and threw him into the Bustan prison in the city. The Imam was infonned of what had transpired. and he ordered the prisoner to be taken out and executed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1020" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1020">[1,020]</a></sup> 'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).' <sup id="cite_ref-1021" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1021">[1,021]</a></sup> 'Various natural disasters, especially a severe drought. that struck Yemen in the years following the execution of Jamal reinforced the opinion among Ihe Muslims in Yemen that the country was being punished for the act. For their part the Jews worked 10 spread and estab· Iish this view. II was also reported that a certain Jewish leader lOl vowed to take Muslim property to compensate for what the Imam Isma'il had confiscated from the Jews. It is related that he actually did so by means of witchcraft that destroyed Muslim propeny and harmed their villages and fields. 102 From a Hebrew source at our disposal, a lament by Shelo~ mo ben Ho!er al_'Uzayri,IOJ we learn that the reference is to the serious drought that occurred in 1669 throughout Yemen. This calamity struck the Jews in panicular, not only on account of the economic structure of the country, in which they were chiefly anisans remote from farming, but also owing to their poverty resulting from the heavy fines imposed on them and the expropriation of their property two years previously. The government, as was its wont, exploited these terrible circumstances, and did not supply the Jews with grain from its stores unless they convened. And indeed, as Hamami,l04 "about five hundred or more of Israel altered their faith, and it was as the generation of apostasy owing to the poverty that was from the start and owing to the famine that visited the earth", 'Uzayri points out not only the great famine but also the wandering of the Jews from place (0 place in search of food, and the decrees imposed on them by the "kingdom of evil" precisely at the time of their woe.' <sup id="cite_ref-1022" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1022">[1,022]</a></sup> 'Some attenuation in the acts of repression against the Jews seems to have taken place towards the end of the life of the Imam Isma'il. In 1084 of the Hijrah (beginning 18 April 1673), he decided to release the propeny of the Jews that had been taken from them six years before. However. he imposed other taxes on the Jews in addition to the jizyah. 'OS The death of 15m3'11 and the ascent to power of his nephew alMahdi Ahmad ibn Hasan sparked the hope among the Jews of Yemen that an end to their suffering had come at last. An expression of this is three poems written by Shabazi in honour of this imam. '06 For our purpose of importance is the third poem, in which Shabazi says (translation from Arabic): "[...J In the rule of Ahmad I travelled peacefully and securely.

Men, women, and children share responsibility for the care of livestock. Women gather firewood and water; in some regions, they now receive assistance from the men, who have acquired Japanese trucks. The family's livelihood may also depend on women selling homemade goods and produce in the marketplace.' <sup id="cite_ref-1024" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1024">[1,024]</a></sup> 'Yemen’s difficult terrain, limited soil, inconsistent water supply, and large number of microclimates have fostered some of the most highly sophisticated methods of water conservation and seed adaptation found anywhere in the world, making possible the cultivation of surprisingly diverse crops. The most common crops are cereals such as millet, corn (maize), wheat, barley, and sorghum; myriad vegetables from a burgeoning truck farm industry have appeared on the market in recent years. There has also been extensive cultivation of fruits-both tropical (mangoes, plantains, bananas, melons, papayas, and citrus) and temperate (pears, peaches, apples, and grapes). The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis). The coffee trade, which began in the 16th century, was originally based on Yemeni coffee, and, for centuries, coffee was the most important and renowned export of Yemen. The port city of Mocha-from which a distinctive style of coffee takes its name-was the point from which most of Yemen’s coffee was exported between the 16th and 18th centuries, before more-economical plantation cultivation was introduced in other parts of the world. In Yemen the coffee tree grows best in the middle highlands, at elevations of 4,500 to 6,500 feet (1,400 to 2,000 metres), where khat also flourishes.' <sup id="cite_ref-1025" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1025">[1,025]</a></sup> 'The typical Yemeni farmer raises at least some poultry and livestock, typically regional varieties of chickens, goats, sheep, or cattle. Agricultural aid programs sponsored by Western countries in the 1970s and ’80s introduced new varieties of dairy and beef cattle in the more temperate regions of the north, but Yemen still imports much of the livestock and dairy and poultry products it consumes.' <sup id="cite_ref-1026" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1026">[1,026]</a></sup> Coffee and khat were important cash crops: 'The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis).

The latter is an evergreen shrub whose young leaves, which contain an alkaloid, are chewed as a mild stimulant. The production and consumption of khat occupy a prominent position in the culture and economy of Yemen. Increased affluence has allowed a growing section of the population to indulge in its use, which the government has attempted-with little success-to discourage. Greater demand has fueled a substantial increase in khat acreage. Although older coffee terraces are often converted to khat as their productivity declines, much of the land being devoted to khat was formerly considered marginal for commercial agricultural purposes and now benefits from regular soil-enhancement programs and terrace-maintenance efforts.' <sup id="cite_ref-1027" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1027">[1,027]</a></sup> Cotton became more common in the 20th century: 'Beginning in the 1970s, the cultivation of cotton-both in the Tihāmah coastal plain in the north and in the coastal plain east of Aden-was strongly supported by the respective national governments, and for a while it contributed significantly to national income. At the end of the 20th century, a significant decline in world cotton prices, as well as the high costs of initiation and development, meant that the Yemeni cotton industry was not competitive.' <sup id="cite_ref-1028" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1028">[1,028]</a></sup> Accordingly, the below variables may not apply well to Qasimid-period Yemen.<b>♠ staple cost of principal source of carbohydrates ♣ ♥</b> Dresch reports price fluctuations: 'The structure of payments was that of the state itself. From the time of the Turks (1636) to that of al-Mahdi of al-Mawahib (1687) Yemen supposedly 'was spared hunger and strife, and that wealth was taken which the law permits'. (As we have seen, this is too rosy a view; but the perception is what concerns us.) 'When this man [alMawahib] arose he took what wealth is permitted and what is not permitted. His state grew strong, his prestige became great, his power expanded, the number of his troops increased, and he became more like a king than a caliph' (al-Shawkani 1929: ii. 298). Yet the control of such wealth from taxation was surely vital where the country's agricultural. base was so vulnerable; as in 1723-4, for instance, when "a drought struck San'a' and most of the mountains of Yemen. Most people (sic. akthar al-niis) died of hunger and the villages were emptied of their inhabitants ... People ate even carrion. The price of all grains rose and a qadab reached eight [silver] riyals. Prosperous people gave what they had as alms. AI-Mutawakkil Qasirn b. al-Husayn gave out all that was edible from his store-houses ... and it was distributed among the poor in the alleyways of San'a'. Then there was abundance at the start of the next year [i.e. from the end of summer 1724], which went on until prices reached four qadahs of wheat for only one riyal, or six of sorghum, or eight of barley. Praise God, then, the Lord of the worlds. (Zabarah 1941: 588)" The role of the Imams' public store-houses in smoothing such fluctuations would be an interesting subject. But what is important for the present purpose is the concept of generosity at work here.' <sup id="cite_ref-1029" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1029">[1,029]</a></sup> This makes it harder to provide a 'typical' or average price.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Top fortune ♣ ♥</b> Dresch desribes the wealth of the Qasimid court: 'Besides the wealth to be extracted from the southern peasantry, the Imams of the period also had available, if they could retain control, taxes from a burgeoning coffee trade. The rise and fall of the Yemeni coffee trade with Europe matches almost exactly the trajectory of the Imamate's wealth (see Boxhall 1974; Niebuhr 1792). The English and Dutch established factories at Mocha in  1618; the trade was probably at its height around 1730; and the world price of coffee finally crashed at the start of the nineteenth century, at which point one gets mention of Imams debasing the currency (al-'Amri 1985: 59). This wealth, however, had always to be fought for; the rulers became wealthier and more powerful than hitherto, but still were liable to dispute among themselves.' <sup id="cite_ref-1030" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1030">[1,030]</a></sup> 'The state the Qasimis formed in the midst of this was none the less impressive (for the rulers' genealogy see Fig. 6.1). Al-Qasim himself, who early in his fight against the Turks had wept over his children starving at Barat, was wealthy when the truce was signed. He built the mosque at Shaharah, then built houses for himself and his followers, planted coffee in al-Ahnum, and amassed more land than the public treasury (Nubdhah: 258, 334-6). The court expanded with the southern conquests. Al-Mutawakkil received an embassy from Ethiopia and exchanged gifts of fine horses with Aurangzib of India (Serjeant 1983: 80-1), while his relatives expressed concern about his monthly demands for funds from Lower Yemen. Further criticism of his taxation policy came from Muhammad al-Ghurbani at Barat, but in 1675 the levies on Lower Yemen were redoubled (ibid. 82). Under Muhammad Ahmad, 'He of al-Mawahib'" (1687-1718), the exactions became more severe still, in support of a grandiose court and a large standing army complete with slave soldiers (ibid., Zabarah 1958: 451, 457; alShawkani 1929: ii. 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1031" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1031">[1,031]</a></sup> More detail may be needed before a definitive code can be established.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Other wealth distribution ♣ ♥</b></div><h1><span class="mw-headline" id="References">References</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=YeQasmi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=82" title="Edit section: References">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h1><ol class="references"><li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1"><span class="cite-accessibility-label">Jump up </span>↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Safa, Mohammad Samaun 2005.
