In 1671 Galdan became the supreme khan, and he successfully expanded the Zunghar polity against the Central Asian Muslim oasis cities. By 1688 conflict between the east and west led to the breakup of the confederation. The Zunghars in the east still remained powerful and successfully annexed Mongol territories farther east, thus bringing most of Mongolia under their control. After initial successes, the Zunghar forces returned home to deal with internal conflicts. It was not until 1694 that the Zunghar armies advanced again on Mongolia, this time apparently because of a devastating famine. The Zunghars were finally defeated by Qing forces, apparently as a result of internal conflicts and a smallpox epidemic (Barfield 1989, p. 294)." <sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>Wars in central Asia:"Upon the death of Tsewang Rabtan in 1727, his son Galdan Tseren (r. 1727-1745) succeeded as ruler of the Junghars.

Such summer ceremonies include aspersions of koumiss at the opening of the mare-milking season, OBOO (cairn) worship, and the DANSHUG ritual, in which lay patrons present a mandala to INCARNATE LAMAs. All these rituals were carried out by both large and small groups." <sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> "In the NAADAM 'games' that accompanied religious rituals, archery was practiced with large, blunt ivory heads. The most common target was a pyramid or line of sur, made of leather straps rolled into a cylinder and filled with oak bark or leather, which was to be knocked over. At the beginning of the competition, the umpires (uukhaichin, or "uukhai sayers") gave a cry of uukhai, accompanied by a circular motion of their arms with the hands pointed up to the sky to summon good fortune. The same cry accompanied each striking of the target and the final tallying of the score.

The wrestlers first perform a clockwise circumambulation of the field and traditionally make a libation of mare’s milk to the gods. Before each match the wrestler’s coach chants a magtaal, or praise for the wrestler (see YÖRÖÖL AND MAGTAAL). The wrestler then gives the coach his hat and performs a dance called 'the flapping of the Garuda' (the mythic Indian king of birds) around the banner standard or national flag before touching the ground with his hands. During the bout the competitors' coaches stand next to them shouting advice in a ritualized language and sometimes slapping the wrestlers' buttocks or thighs if the contest seems slow. After one wins the loser passes under the winner’s arm and is slapped on the buttocks, and the winner performs the Garuda dance again. The winner then takes from his coach a handful of crumbly Mongolian cheeses, which he tosses in offering to the local deities and/or the spectators. Young wrestlers eagerly vie to catch and eat these cheeses." <sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Regardless of the exact religious complexion of those performing the ritual, oboo sacrifices are everywhere strikingly similar. Formal worship is always performed in the summer, on a date determined by astrological calculation, and is intended to ensure seasonable rainfall and fertile livestock. Only adult men are allowed to participate in or even watch the ceremony (men are banned from the Daur women’s oboos). The deities worshiped include the various tenggeri (gods), the dragons (luu) who control the rains, the 'master of the land' (gazar-un ezen or sabdag, from Tibetan sa-bdag), or shaman spirits among still shamanic peoples such as the BURIATS and Daurs. Buddhist oboo worship also invokes the powerful fierce bodhisattva Vajrapani (of whom CHINGGIS KHAN was believed to be an emanation body). Either a lama or a respected lay elder presides over the ritual, never a shaman, even if the deity worshiped is a shaman spirit. A small table is set up by the oboo’s southern side for the offering of prayers. Offerings of sacrificial meat are placed on the oboo, and liquor and water are poured on the stones. Most of the meat is eaten by the members of the group sponsoring the sacrifice, but the bones are left at the oboo. Worship opens and closes with a triple clockwise circumambulation, and athletic competitions follow the ritual. Skulls of beloved HORSES are also placed on the oboo after their death. "The texts used by Mongolian lamas for setting up Buddhist oboos and performing the offerings were written by the THIRD MERGEN GEGEEN (1717-66).

While in ancient Shang China tortoise shells were burned by a piece of hot iron, the Mongols always used sheep scapula, or shoulder blades, and simply placed them in a fire. The great khans of the Mongol Empire used scapulimancy to divine the will of heaven (TENGGERI) before virtually every decision. CHINGGIS KHAN carried a charred sheep pelvis as an amulet. This divination was performed by the khans themselves, by shamans (bö’e, modern böö), and sometimes by foreign divination experts, such as YELÜ CHUCAI (1190-1244). The inquirer first had to whisper to the shoulder blade, and then the blade was burned. A straight vertical crack meant yes, and a horizontal crack or splintering meant no. Today shamans follow up the reading of the blade’s cracks with a shamanic session to ask the ONGGHONs (spirit figurines) for further information about the inquirer’s troubles. "Scapulimancy continued in Buddhist Mongolia. The great Tu (Monguor) lama and scholar Sum-pa mKhan-po Ishi-Baljur (Ye-shes dPal-'byor, 1704-87) wrote a text on the topic based on what he knew of the practice among the OOLOD Mongols. In it he notes that a shoulder blade from a freshly slaughtered, healthy, white sheep had to be washed and censed with juniper and/or incense. In a room, the diviner prayed alone to the Buddhist deities and recited a dharani (sacred spell) several times before placing the bone in the fire. The resulting cracks were interpreted according to a complex division of the bone into areas along its edges and along the central spine.

The offering of a yörööl (Kalmyk-Oirat, yöräl, Buriat, yerüül) accompanies virtually all public ritual functions in traditional and in much modern Mongolian life. Occasions for a yörööl include dedication of newly made or acquired tools and implements (felt, YURT, saddles, rifles, etc.); the birth or acquisition of a valuable new animal; the making of a cradle for a newborn baby; the presentation of a whole sheep, liquor, or new KOUMISS; sacrifices to the household fire (see FIRE CULT), the OBOO, or war standard, aspersions (tsatsal) of mare’s milk to heaven (see TENGGERI); and WEDDINGS. Such yörööls often include descriptive magtaals, which are also spoken separately for mountains and other features of the natural environment and especially during sporting events to announce the great qualities of the victorious horse and jockey, wrestler, or archer. Sometimes political addresses and wedding speeches are separated as zorig. "A typical yörööl begins with a syllable or line of invocation, such as om sain amgalan boltugai 'Om (the sacred Tantric seed-syllable)! May there be a good peace!' or the exclamation 'Zee!' The speaker then describes the occasion and the offerings made (where appropriate), praises the features of the object being blessed one by one, gives a predictive picture of its successful use, and concludes with the blessing proper. The poetic forms of yörööls and magtaals are marked by groups of lines (couplets, tercets, or quatrains) alliterating on the first syllable. Parallelism between both lines and larger strophes is common, as are long catalogue-like lists. One of the most distinctive features of this genre and Mongolian ritual language generally is the combination of repeated restatement of obvious facts together with pervasive hyperbole. Thus, a YURT’s latticework is jade and its door is garnet, an arrow is fledged with the 'flight feathers of the King Garuda (the mythological Indian bird) who flies gracefully on high,' and so on. This ritual hyperbole, found also in Mongolian EPICS, resembles a lay adaption of the language of Tantric visualizations, which re-creates this world in the form of a perfected world. "In Mongolian society men with a talent for speaking such praises and blessings, called yöröölchi (blessers) or khonjin, are widely sought for all sorts of ritual occasions. While the addresses are delivered orally and creative variations on existing patterns are valued, written exemplars have long circulated in booklets to help speakers develop their repertoire." <sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ monthly ♥</b> Inferred.

Such summer ceremonies include aspersions of koumiss at the opening of the mare-milking season, OBOO (cairn) worship, and the DANSHUG ritual, in which lay patrons present a mandala to INCARNATE LAMAs. All these rituals were carried out by both large and small groups." <sup id="cite_ref-290" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-290">[290]</a></sup> "In the NAADAM 'games' that accompanied religious rituals, archery was practiced with large, blunt ivory heads. The most common target was a pyramid or line of sur, made of leather straps rolled into a cylinder and filled with oak bark or leather, which was to be knocked over. At the beginning of the competition, the umpires (uukhaichin, or "uukhai sayers") gave a cry of uukhai, accompanied by a circular motion of their arms with the hands pointed up to the sky to summon good fortune. The same cry accompanied each striking of the target and the final tallying of the score. The victorious archer received the title mergen (sharpshooter, but also wise man)." <sup id="cite_ref-291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-291">[291]</a></sup> "Horse racing is one of Mongolia's 'three manly games,' although ironically it is today most often performed by young boys and girls." <sup id="cite_ref-292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-292">[292]</a></sup> "Wrestling matches occur during NAADAM, or games held in conjunction with summertime religious ceremonies or national holidays. The wrestlers first perform a clockwise circumambulation of the field and traditionally make a libation of mare’s milk to the gods. Before each match the wrestler’s coach chants a magtaal, or praise for the wrestler (see YÖRÖÖL AND MAGTAAL). The wrestler then gives the coach his hat and performs a dance called 'the flapping of the Garuda' (the mythic Indian king of birds) around the banner standard or national flag before touching the ground with his hands. During the bout the competitors' coaches stand next to them shouting advice in a ritualized language and sometimes slapping the wrestlers' buttocks or thighs if the contest seems slow. After one wins the loser passes under the winner’s arm and is slapped on the buttocks, and the winner performs the Garuda dance again. The winner then takes from his coach a handful of crumbly Mongolian cheeses, which he tosses in offering to the local deities and/or the spectators. Young wrestlers eagerly vie to catch and eat these cheeses." <sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Regardless of the exact religious complexion of those performing the ritual, oboo sacrifices are everywhere strikingly similar. Formal worship is always performed in the summer, on a date determined by astrological calculation, and is intended to ensure seasonable rainfall and fertile livestock. Only adult men are allowed to participate in or even watch the ceremony (men are banned from the Daur women’s oboos). The deities worshiped include the various tenggeri (gods), the dragons (luu) who control the rains, the 'master of the land' (gazar-un ezen or sabdag, from Tibetan sa-bdag), or shaman spirits among still shamanic peoples such as the BURIATS and Daurs. Buddhist oboo worship also invokes the powerful fierce bodhisattva Vajrapani (of whom CHINGGIS KHAN was believed to be an emanation body). Either a lama or a respected lay elder presides over the ritual, never a shaman, even if the deity worshiped is a shaman spirit. A small table is set up by the oboo’s southern side for the offering of prayers. Offerings of sacrificial meat are placed on the oboo, and liquor and water are poured on the stones. Most of the meat is eaten by the members of the group sponsoring the sacrifice, but the bones are left at the oboo. Worship opens and closes with a triple clockwise circumambulation, and athletic competitions follow the ritual. Skulls of beloved HORSES are also placed on the oboo after their death. "The texts used by Mongolian lamas for setting up Buddhist oboos and performing the offerings were written by the THIRD MERGEN GEGEEN (1717-66). In them the Mergen Gegeen criticized the blood sacrifices and gluttonous feasting and merrymaking that accompanied the oboo sacrifice, but despite his admonition and that of later authors of Buddhist didactic poetry, meat was still widely used even in lamas’ offerings." <sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"These offerings began with a poem in the Tibetan shabdan (from zhabs-brtan, firm feet) genre requesting the lama to remain in this world for the sake of sentient beings and the presentation of a silver mandala, then followed with a gilt statue of Ayushi (Amitayus), Buddha of eternal life, and the scripture Tsendoo, written in five jewels." <sup id="cite_ref-295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-295">[295]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> Every summer <sup id="cite_ref-296" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-296">[296]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> Every summer <sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> Every summer <sup id="cite_ref-298" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-298">[298]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 24 ♥</b> hours. 1 day.

[...] From 1585 to 1588 the Third Dalai Lama personally toured southwest Inner Mongolia. In 1585 a ruler of KHALKHA (Mongolia proper), ABATAI KHAN (1554-88), learned about Buddhism from a party of merchants from the Tümed region and began building a temple. The next year he personally visited the Dalai Lama at Altan Khan’s capital, Guihua (modern HOHHOT). [...] "Mantras and numbered categories, such as the Three Jewels, the 'six syllables' om mani padme hum, and the eightfold restraint (moral rules), transmitted basic instruction. Neichi Toin and his patrons rewarded anyone who memorized the mantra of the fierce protector deity Yamantaka. Neichi Toin was later accused of freely giving out Yamantaka initiations to commoners and was recalled from the mission field by the Manchu emperor on advice of the Fifth Dalai Lama in 1652. Key political leaders, both male and female, everywhere received the Tantric Hevajra initiation. "Conversion narratives suggest varied patterns for individual conversion. Neichi Toin rejected the world when he saw the death throes of a pregnant wild ass he and his friends had shot. Altan and Abatai converted after successful campaigns had confirmed their leadership; they saw reestablishing the 'TWO CUSTOMS' (khoyar yosu) of religion and state as a way of confirming their success. Miracles, healings, and supernatural contests played a role. Reading Mongolian translations of Buddhist hagiographies and viewing the splendor of mandalas and other Tantric rituals are also mentioned as strengthening weak faith. Although not treated in detail in the sources, it seems clear that women played the leading role in promoting conversion; virtually every strong male adherent can be linked to a devout woman, either his wife or a blood relative. "The Second Conversion was fiercely intolerant of the native Mongolian religion. The JEWEL TRANSLUCENT SUTRA (1607) boasts that under Altan Khan 'the mad and stupid shamans were annihilated and the shamanesses humiliated.' Khutugtai Sechen Khung-Taiji prescribed harsh penalties for funerary blood sacrifices, making or sacrificing to an ONGGHON (spirit figurines), or striking a monk. Instead, yurts were to have six-armed Mahakalas worshiped with fasting and bloodless offerings, and funerals were to be marked by almsgiving. In Khorchin government messengers accompanied by Neichi Toin’s disciples collected enough ongghons to fill a YURT, all of which were burned. Later codes, such as the 1640 MONGOL-OIRAT CODE, reduced unrealistically severe penalties to more practical livestock fines but kept the prohibitions on shamanist activity. "Apart from these laws, few other Mongolian practices were directly banned. Human sacrifice disappeared rapidly. Individual hunting and the eating of horse flesh were discouraged, but collective public hunts continued and were enshrined in the Mongol-Oirat Code. Strikingly, the EIGHT WHITE YURTS, or shrine of CHINGGIS KHAN, with its blood sacrifices, remained an integral part of government even in a Buddhist utopia such as the CHAGHAN TEUKE (White history). "This new exclusivist vision of dGe-lugs-pa Buddhism also targeted the older orders still found in eastern and northern Mongolia. The Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-82) told an eminent Mongolian lama returning from education in Tibet: 'If you propagate the Old Teaching in the Mongol lands it will only bring bad luck! If anybody else tries to spread them, you must stop him!'" <sup id="cite_ref-422" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-422">[422]</a></sup> "Two Customs (Khoyar Yosu) This concept, along with the allied concept of “offering site and almsgiver” (or priest and patron), linked the Buddhist religion to imperial rule in Inner Asia. The “Two Customs” of Buddhist religion (shashin) and monarchical rule (toro) established a mutually harmonious relation between the two fundamental orders of society, celibate monks and married householders. The monarch served as an “almsgiver” (oglige-yin ejen, from Tibetan yon-bdag) to the monks, who served as an “offering site” (takhil-un oron, from Tibetan mchod-gnas). The monarch also had the duty to ensure the discipline of the monastic community (sangha), expelling the unfit. From the Tangut XIA DYNASTY (1038-1227) on, the monarch would ideally receive an initiation into one of the great Tantric Buddhist deities following a preparatory course of study with fastings and meditations and would prostrate himself before his lama- teacher. While shocking to defenders of imperial prerogatives, this Tantric pupil-teacher relation was the acme of the “almsgiver-offering-site” relation. (Although the translation “two principles” has become common, the word yosu in Mongolian is always “custom,” with its implication of past tradition.)" <sup id="cite_ref-423" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-423">[423]</a></sup></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MnZungh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=66" title="Edit section: Deification of Rulers">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div>(‘gods’ is a shorthand for ‘supernatural agents’)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> absent/present/unknown.

So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another.

The Buddhist belief among the Oirats, surrounded by the Muslim Turks, was peculiarly militant and focused on the Dalai Lama in Tibet, whose name itself was a common religious prayer. The biography of the great monk-scholar Zaya Pandita Namkhai- amtsu vividly illustrates the aristocratic Buddhist milieu. A nobleman might donate up to 10,000 horses for a single religious service or requisition his subjects to become bandi (novices) or lay servants in the monasteries. The clergy and their “disciples” were protected from both violence and state duties. Novices who had married without taking the major vows were probably common although legally discouraged. The monasteries were mostly nomadic, although in 1638 a Zünghar ruler requested pigs from Russia to give to the monasteries." <sup id="cite_ref-554" class="reference"><a
