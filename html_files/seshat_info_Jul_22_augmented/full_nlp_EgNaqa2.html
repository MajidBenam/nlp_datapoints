Named after the site where British archaeologist Flinders Petrie uncovered a necropolis of over 3000 graves in the late 19th century,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_EgNaqa2] the Naqada culture is dated from around 3800 to 3100 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_EgNaqa2] The Naqada has been subdivided into three periods ‒ the Amratian, Gerzean, and Semainean ‒ as well as, more recently, into Naqada IA-C, IIA-D, and IIIA-D.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_EgNaqa2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_EgNaqa2] Seshat's 'Naqada 1' (3800-3550 BCE) corresponds to the Naqada IA-IIB phases; Naqada 2 (3550-3300 BCE) to IIC-IID; and Naqada 3 (3300-3100 BCE) to IIIA-IIIB. We end Naqada 3 with the IIIB-C transition, because the First Dynasty of the Egyptian state is considered to begin with the accession of King Aha in Naqada IIIC.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_EgNaqa2] Naqada III is also sometimes referred to as the Protodynastic period or 'Dynasty 0'.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Early Naqada archaeological material is clustered around the key sites of Naqada itself, Abydos, and Hierakonpolis (ancient Nekhen) in the fertile land nestled around the 'Qena bend' of the Nile.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_EgNaqa2] However, from the late Naqada II onwards, there is an archaeologically visible expansion of the culture both southwards along the Nile and northwards into Lower Egypt (the Delta), eventually reaching as far north as the Levant in Naqada IIIA-B.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_EgNaqa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and Political Organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The 4th millennium BCE was a crucial period for Egyptian state formation. Prior to roughly 3800 BCE, Upper Egypt was inhabited by seasonally mobile farmers and herders, constituting an archaeological culture known as the Badarian.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_EgNaqa2] However, the Naqada periods brought a series of key social transformations to the region, including increasing inequality, a greater commitment to sedentary settlement and cereal farming, the emergence of full-time craft specialists, and, towards the end of the millennium, the invention of writing.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgNaqa2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgNaqa2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgNaqa2] The growth of hierarchical social structures and the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt laid the foundations for the divine kings and complex bureaucracy of the Old Kingdom and beyond.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During Naqada I, new forms of political organization appeared ‒ relatively swiftly compared to other prehistoric cultures ‒ in the upper Nile Valley.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgNaqa2] According to the Egyptologist Branislav Anđelković, previously autonomous agricultural villages began to band together to form 'chiefdoms' or 'proto-nomes' between Naqada IA and IB (a 'nome' was an administrative division in the later Egyptian state).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgNaqa2] In Naqada IC, even larger political entities ‒ 'nome pre-states' ‒ started to form, centred on Naqada, Abydos and Hierakonpolis. It has been suggested that a 'primitive chiefdom' centred around a 'royal' authority based at Hierakonpolis, had formed by around 3700 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgNaqa2] Not all researchers agree with this terminology, believing that it creates the impression of an inexorable march towards state formation, and some prefer to stress the fragile and experimental nature of early complex social formations in Upper Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgNaqa2] However, the term chiefdom remains in common usage as a label for the new ranked societies of the early 4th millennium.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgNaqa2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgNaqa2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgNaqa2] In the Naqada II period, 'proto-states' formed, and by the Naqada III we can speak of kings and a centralized government ruling over a unified Upper and Lower Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_EgNaqa2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]We lack firm figures for the population of Egypt during the Naqada. At the beginning of the period, most inhabitants of Upper Egypt were living in small villages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_EgNaqa2] However, as the 4th millennium progressed, archaeologists can discern a process of urbanization and aggregation into larger political units. The largest known settlement, Hierakonpolis, grew into a regional centre of power in the 3800‒3500 BCE period[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_EgNaqa2] and may have reached a population of between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the late Naqada I.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_EgNaqa2] Other researchers consider this figure 'inflated'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_EgNaqa2] and point to recent evidence from the Abydos region for low population numbers throughout the Predynastic period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_EgNaqa2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Malwina Brachmanska; Edward A L Turner ♥</b> <i>these codes were reviewed at at the Seshat Workshop on Egyptian History, Oxford 2014</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgNaqa2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [5,000-20,000] ♥</b> KM2.

It seems, however, that until the end of Naqada IIB period (3400 BCE) only three polities in Upper Egypt prevailed (there is still a huge lack of information about the Middle Egypt region), which remain quite stable for the rest of the Naqada II period.

The closest and earliest evidence we have for digging associated with irrigation is the ceremonial inauguration of a waterwork on the macehead of the Scorpion King, which shows two workmen with hoes excavating while the king wields a large hoe and a man holding a basket anticipates the king's action. The scene may represent not the digging of a canal but rather the ceremonial breaking of a dam to let floodwater flow into a natural irrigation basin, an act which was traditional in later times. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_EgNaqa2] The iconographical interpretation of the mace-head of the Skorpion raises a lot of controversy and it is said that it could either be the canal building in a particular place (possibly Memphis), and not appearance of the irrigation system in general - or, there are also interpretations which are far from the canal digging.

However, based on existing materials it is possible to mark some trends, actions or items which were parts of those rituals:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1)The archaeological data suggests an abundance of burial rituals. A few types of tombs can be distinguished - next to the simple grave pits there are elaborate burials with the grave goods, there are amulets in the graves and the elaborate post-mortem treatment is noticeable. All of that is presumably connected with appropriate rituals[MAJIDBENAM_REF_212_EgNaqa2]. Single burials definitely dominate, although graves that contain a few individuals are also detectable. There is a trend to place a body crouched in a foetal position, oriented more or less to the S, along the Nile, with the head faced to the West (although the precise position and orientation began to vary from one cemetery to another and even within the same cemetery)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_213_EgNaqa2]. Some children started to be buried in the large vessels, occasionally within the settlement. The grave goods had generally fixed place within the grave[MAJIDBENAM_REF_214_EgNaqa2]. Sometimes, some funerary offerings started to be put separately from the body (cubbyholes and compartments). There is also evidence of the fragmentation of certain items or of some of the types of the objects, for example fishtail bifaces or other knives[MAJIDBENAM_REF_215_EgNaqa2]. In some tombs, the deceased was placed in the coffin, and the body was wrapped in mats (more commonly than in animal skin). Wrapping some deceased representatives of the elite in linen clothes started[MAJIDBENAM_REF_216_EgNaqa2]. The orientation of the body, with the connection of model boats found in graves or painted on jars, rocks and on Hierakonpolis tomb 100 wall may be the indication in belief in the journey to the afterlife (boats could also symbolize transportation of the corpse or be part of some rituals for the living[MAJIDBENAM_REF_217_EgNaqa2]). The deceased facing Westward could be a sign of the beginning of placing the Land of the Death on the West, which is typical for the Dynastic period. Wrapping the body could be the first sign of trials of preservation of the body, which also could be connected with the beliefs and grave discoveries of bowls filled with soil and containing some seeds of wheat. All of this suggests a belief in rebirth after death[MAJIDBENAM_REF_218_EgNaqa2]. In Gerzean graves, storage jars that contained ashes with thick vegetable paste on the top were revealed, “as if some funerary feast and pouring of libation had taken place at the graveside before burial”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_219_EgNaqa2].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2) Another trend related to preserving flesh worth mentioning is ritual body dismemberment before the interment would be placed. It occurs only in the minority of the burials, but, as many graves were previously disturbed, the proportion is much higher than is seen in the statistics[MAJIDBENAM_REF_220_EgNaqa2]. Most of them date to Naqada II, however that practice started in Naqada IC times[MAJIDBENAM_REF_221_EgNaqa2]. Graves with the embodiment are situated in e.g. Naqada, Armant, el-Gerza, el-Amra, Adaima, Hierakonpolis. The interpretations of those burials are far from certainty. It seems that at least the majority of the graves may be secondary burials. It is also possible that the action is connected with a few rituals, as some differences in the treatment of the body are visible. Most of the disarticulated bodies are the effects of simple pre-burial embodiment. One to a few bodies were placed with some bones in a non-anatomical position or the bones of a few individuals are completely mixed, sometimes with the crania in different place of the tomb or even with no traces of skulls (disjunction and possibly later re-deposition of the head). In the cemetery of el-Gerza, really interesting ritualistic treatment of the body is seen in several cases. The crania was filled with sand, which had been rammed in tightly and later the skull was put in position. In those skulls beads were found[MAJIDBENAM_REF_222_EgNaqa2].Bones from that kind of burials are often associated with rich graves. It was suggested by Petrie that at least some of those deceased were eaten, but his “cannibalistic interpretation was rejected as, for example, there were no burning traces on the bones[MAJIDBENAM_REF_223_EgNaqa2]. The second type of the body treatment occurs in Adaima and Hierakonpolis HK43 cemeteries. There are individuals with vertebrae lacerations what can be the traced of decapitation and on the HK43 five males with cut marks from scalping were found, a practice previously undocumented in Egypt[MAJIDBENAM_REF_224_EgNaqa2]. As there is no clear proof that would explain the unusual treatment, the suggestions are: some kind of mortuary ritual, human sacrifice or effect of a punishment[MAJIDBENAM_REF_225_EgNaqa2].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]3) At the two sites, Mahasna and Hierakonpolis a great number of animal bones were found. Great similarities are seen between the places where they were found[MAJIDBENAM_REF_226_EgNaqa2]. Both are in undomesticated areas - in Mahasna Block 3 and in Hierakonpolis at the locality HK 29A, that means within a ceremonial centre. Both have similar composition of domestic and wild fauna remains - cattle and sheep/goats that were killed at a younger age dominate, on average (compared to other areas of the site), and there is a presence of wild species, which were large, dangerous and/or had symbolic meaning. A focus on forelimbs of animals and bigger assemblage of wild species as well as greater number of decorated and imported ceramics is also seen. This evidence is interpreted as ritual sacrifice of animals and their later consumption, which means feasting[MAJIDBENAM_REF_227_EgNaqa2]. It seems that it was an elite ritual associated with hunting, warfare (interpretation from Mahasna) or performed in order to keep the maintenance of cosmic order (interpretation from Hierakonpolis)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_228_EgNaqa2].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]4) There are female and male figurines with raised arms painted on D-class pottery and the female statuettes are found in graves[MAJIDBENAM_REF_229_EgNaqa2]. Based on that, a hypothesis was put forward for the existence of goddess cult in Naqada II period[MAJIDBENAM_REF_230_EgNaqa2]. And the men painted next to women would be divine consort[MAJIDBENAM_REF_231_EgNaqa2]. In that case, putting the figures in the grave would be a part of some (burial?) ritual. However, the figurines from the period coded cannot be connected with the divine figurines without uncertainty[MAJIDBENAM_REF_232_EgNaqa2]. According to another interpretation, however, the depictions of people with raised arms are a representation of dancers, which can be seen for example on the D-class pottery as well as on the Gebelein Cloth or wall of the tomb 100 in Hieraconpolis. Those painted dancing women and men are prominent in river scenes (nilotic landscape), connected for example with boats and Nile flora, and that kind of paintings are typical for the Naqada II period. It could be a part of some kind of ritual, maybe funerary rite (some scholars connect it with the Sed festival, which is rather unlikely)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_233_EgNaqa2].One of other assumptions is that those “Dancing Goddess” are connected somehow with kind of fertility rituals[MAJIDBENAM_REF_234_EgNaqa2].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]5)From the earliest stages of Naqada II, some scenes that are connected with rulers start to appear. It occurs on Gebelein Cloth as well as on the painting in the Hierakonpolis tomb 100. Some archaeologists see in those depictions the beginnings of the celebration of the royal jubilee, which means the Sed festival. However, those are only assumptions, which for now cannot be proved - nothing connected with that feast is mentioned before the First Dynasty period. There is also a strong conviction of connection of those scenes with the ruler's burial ritual (the boats procession, dancing scenes etc.)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_235_EgNaqa2].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is impossible to say with any certainty which are the largest scale or the most widespread rituals. Within the archaeological records, mortuary practices, with the majority being primary burials are most visible. And for now, they should be treated as the most widespread, the most frequent and the most dysphoric collective rituals.It also seems that the body embodiment (treated separately from the vertebrae laceration and cut-marks on the skull found in Hierakonpolis and Adaima) is quite widespread as it can be seen as well in some of the most Southern Naqada settlements as well as in Gerza cemetery located near the Delta. If the Sed festival (or some ritual from which Sed festival emerged) occurred in Naqada II period, it might have brought together a large number of people. The same could be said of the feasting, although it seems that at Mahasna it brought together a certain group of people. As there are really few discovered settlements, it is also possible that feasting and ritualistic killing of animals could be much more widespread than it seems. Also, “dancing women depictions and figurines” seem to be common among archaeological evidence, however it is really hard to put it in a proper ritualistic context. It could be the largest scale, especially if that dancing is connected with the funerary rites or fertility rituals, but there is no certainty to that assumption.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgNaqa2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ elite funeral ♥</b> "In the early Naqada II period, in several locations throughout Upper Egypt, there began to emerge po- litical centers whose rulers exhibited their power and status in the outstanding size and wealth of their burials. These elite tombs were eventually segregated within a discrete section of the general necropolis or, in the most extreme cases, in entirely separate cemeteries, as seen at Abydos, Naqada, and Hierakonpolis (Wilkinson 2000a; Midant-Reynes 2003). The elite cemetery (HK6) at Hierakonpolis (fig. 4.6) is located in isolation 2 kilometers into the desert. Like other early sites, it also had large tombs (Adams 2000a), but it is only recently that excavations have revealed how much further the Hierakonpolis elite took the display of their status by placing their sizable tombs within impressive architectural settings and surrounding them with subsidiary graves containing an intriguing array of human and animal associates (Friedman 2008a-b, 2010; Friedman et al. in press). "Recent excavations have concentrated around Tomb 16, a large tomb of the Naqada IC-IIA period (ca. 3650 bc) into which a brick-lined tomb of the Naqada IIIA2 period had later been inserted in what appears to have been an act of respectful renovation rather than usurpation (fig. 4.7). The original tomb measures approximately 4.3 x 2.6 meters and is roughly 1.45 meters deep, making it among the largest known from this period. In addition to its size, and despite plundering and reuse, it was a very rich tomb. More than 115 pottery vessels have been recorded from it, including one incised with the earliest known emblem of Bat, showing her close association with power from the beginning (Hendrickx 2008). "Two of the best-preserved and most remarkable of the ceramic masks known exclusively from this cemetery also originate from this tomb (fig. 4.8). Curved to fit over the human head and attached by means of a string passed through holes behind the ears, they are Egypt’s earliest funerary masks. They stand at the beginning of a tradition whose origin has long been a matter of conjecture. "These grave goods, however, are only one indication of the owners’ great power. More expressive still is the network of interconnected wooden enclosures containing the graves of associates which surround the tomb on all four sides in an arrangement that anticipates the rows of subsidiary graves around the tombs of the First Dynasty kings at Abydos (fig. 4.9) (overview in Vandou 2008 and 'The First Kings of Egypt: The Abydos Evidence' in this volume). "Although all the satellite tombs have been heavily plundered and less than half the complex has been explored, enough remains of their contents to suggest that there was nothing arbitrary about their layout or their occupants. Near the front (east side) were young hunters with weapons and other gear, at the rear the women and children with ivory hair combs, semiprecious stone beads, and delicate pottery (fig. 4.10). The fine items with which they were buried already suggest that they were specially selected for the honor of accompanying their lord, but their demographic is even more revealing. "Of the thirty-six individuals found within the thirteen tombs directly flanking Tomb 16, no one is younger than eight years of age and no one is older than thirty-five; over two-thirds of them were juveniles under fifteen years of age and young women. The sample is still limited, but this is far from normal mortality. While there is nothing to prove that all the graves were created at the same time, or that all the bodies in them were interred concurrently, the fences around them could only have been erected after the graves had been dug and refilled, and the continuous foundation trench in which to bed the wooden posts indicates a single building phase (Friedman et al. in press). "For the animals, whose tombs form an outer perimeter around the entire compound, there is no doubt that they accompanied their master in death. Near identical radiocarbon dates from two of these animals indicate that both met their end at the same time — some point between 3660 and 3640 bc. These animals, buried whole, include an African elephant, a wild bull (aurochs), hartebeest, hippopotamus, three baboons, three domestic cattle (bull, cow, and calf), two large goats, twenty-seven dogs, and six cats — forty-six animals in all (so far), among which different levels of care and value are clearly evident. [...] "The different levels of effort taken in the burial of these animals suggest that their meaning need not be the same. In general, the wide variety of taxa interred around the perimeter may have symbolically provided protection against the natural chaos they represented, but the burial of domestic animals may also have insured an eternal food supply and companionship, along with forming part of an ostentatious display of the sacrifice of valuable assets. However, the burial of the large wild animals was probably more than anything else a display of power. The ownership of these exotic animals would have been a strong visual statement to this effect. The creation and maintenance of royal menageries is known to have been a means of legitimizing pharaohs in the New Kingdom (Müller-Wollermann 2003), and may also have served this purpose at this early time. Yet the power exhibited here was not simply the authority to control or kill these creatures, but also to become them, taking their formidable natural attributes for one’s own. In this way, these graves reflect the physical reality behind the animal-based iconographies of power that dominate in the early periods of Egyptian history, as seen, for example, on the Narmer Palette and other documents, where royal power is manifest in several animal guises. The evidence from Hierakonpolis now suggests this royal symbolism can be traced back to actual physical mastery over some of the most powerful creatures of their world. "Although little remains above ground in the HK6 cemetery to help us, some idea of the pageantry, spectacle, and ritual that took place here can be gleaned from the decorated walls of the Painted Tomb 100, at the edge of the cultivation (Quibell and Green 1902; fig. 8.2 herein). Dating to the Naqada IIC period, when the elite cemetery had for some reason fallen into disuse, and elite burials throughout Egypt in general were rare, it seems that its owner (whether royal or just a pretender) still managed to take all the trappings with him to his burial place by painting them on the tomb’s walls. Between the funerary or ritual barks we see animals being hunted and captured for ultimate burial, the ritual slaughter of animals and people, as well as displays of combat and domination, all to the accompaniment of female dancers, while a cohort of officials look on from an adjacent wall (see 'Iconography of the Predynastic and Early Dynastic Periods')." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_236_EgNaqa2] Sources do not explicitly say that this was the largest Predynastic ritual. However, it was clearly meant to impress, as suggested by the grand architecture, the large numbers of animals and humans sacrificed, and the vast quantities of precious items deposited as offerings. It seems reasonable to infer a large audience. Importantly, we know a little more about this ritual than most other candidates for largest ritual.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (participants) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (audience) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b><b>Dysphoric elements</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fasting ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ vigil/sleep deprivation ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fear ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ humiliation ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ disgust ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ poisoning/dysphoria-causing drugs ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> (e.g. vomiting)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ pain ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ mutilation ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ risk of death ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other ♣ ♥</b></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Euphoric elements</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ feasting ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ alcohol ♣ present ♥</b> "Furthermore, beer was produced in considerable quantities close to the elite cemetery and, as with the pottery production, this cannot have been for regular consumption in daily life but must have been served during funeral rituals."

of animal bones deriving from domestic livestock and fish as well as a diverse array of wild animals. The volume of bones, the presence of all elements of the skeletons, and the debris from the sharpening of flint knives combine to suggest that large numbers of animals were butchered at this site. The high-quality cattle, young sheep and goats, and the large fish, many over one meter in length, indicate feasting formed a large part of the festivities; however, the wild animals, including crocodile, softshell turtle, hippopotamus, gazelle, barbary sheep, and various carnivores, im- ply something more than just fine dining. Making up nearly 17 percent of the faunal assemblage (com- pared to 1.5 percent in the general settlement), this collection of wild and often dangerous game had a much more important purpose — the control of chaos (Linseele et al. 2009). One of the fundamental themes of Predynastic iconography, the imposition of order over chaos, especially as embodied in the diversity of nature (see “Iconography of the Predynastic and Early Dynastic Periods” in this volume) continued to be the most important role of Egyptian kingship (Kemp 2006, pp. 92-99). Bringing this concept to life, the wrestling of these animals into submission and their ultimate sacrifice with ceremonial knives in this open court must have been a vivid demonstration of the containment of the chaotic and the victory of (human) order necessary to keep the cosmos in balance (Perry in press). "An incised potsherd also found among the temple debris further illustrates that domination was not limited to the animal sphere. On the obverse is the distinctive emblem of the cow goddess Bat, whose image also graces the Narmer Palette (Fischer 1962), while the reverse shows a stylized female held captive by an early symbol of royal authority, the bull (fig. 4.5) (Hendrickx 2002). "The seasonal availability of desert and aquatic fauna suggests that the rituals were associated with the coming of the Nile flood, an especially chaotic moment in the cosmic cycle of renewal that required extraordinary powers to negotiate. This mastery was such an important aspect of royal ideology, it may well be this specific time (or its corollary, the heb-sed jubilee or renewal of the king) and possibly even this actual place that is depicted on the Narmer Macehead, as the king presides over wild animals corralled in an oval court while large numbers of livestock and human captives are amassed for inspection. The temple both proclaimed and reinforced the authority of the king, but this was not the only way the established social order expressed itself, as work in the cemeteries has also shown."

Among the animal remains from Predynastic settlement sites, wild animals generally make up around 1&nbsp;% or less of the archaeozoological material. Only during the Badarian and the very beginning of the Naqada period (ca. 4400-3800 BC) do wild animals represent a significant portion of the faunal assemblage, around 10&nbsp;%. This indicates a strong decrease in the importance of hunting over a relatively short period. [...] "The scarcity of wild animal remains from Predynastic settlement sites is in strong contrast with the importance of hunting scenes in contemporaneous iconography. [...] "Together with a few very exceptional scenes of military triumph, hunting representations are the only topics that are rendered in more complex early Predynastic scenes (Kohler 2002, Hendrickx 2010, Hartung 2010). Moreover, these two topics are strongly related through the concept of order over chaos. [...] "The symbolic importance of hunting can be demonstrated by examining the depiction of killing and capture. As mentioned before, the actual killing of animals is not shown in Predynastic hunting scenes, neither are slain animals. The most frequently represented action is that of catching animals by lassos or traps. However, two important exceptions to this principle should be noted, namely the hippopotamus and the wild ass. As already mentioned, the hippopotamus hunting scenes show hunters with spears actually hitting the animals. In some cases, only the spears hitting the animals are shown, not the hunters. Capturing a mature hippopotamus would have been a very difficult undertaking, but this may not have been the primary reason for depicting the killing of the animal. In the royal hippopotamus hunt, the spearing is essential, as is shown through the title Hrw-msnw, “Horus the Spearer” (Muller 2008, p. 482). Hippopotami are very harmful for agriculture because of their nightly foraging, and they are most dangerous when disturbed. In this respect, it is not difficult to understand why they represent chaotic forces to be controlled by the king, responsible for establishing order over chaos (Save-Soderbergh 1953, pp. 12-16; Muller 2008, p. 488). "Hunting was not only a symbolic concept but also an actual activity. Although desert hunting camps do not leave many traces and are notoriously elusive to archaeologists, numerous rock art sites in both the eastern and western desert testify to frequent human presence. Hunting scenes are often depicted in rock art which could be considered as a direct illustration of what actually happened at a particular place in the desert, unlike the hunting scenes on other media. In some cases, rock art sites coincide with very favourable hunting locations, facilitating an interpretation of rock art sites as occurring in the context of hunting expeditions (Gatto et al. 2009, pp. 159-165). "The rock art panel from “Was-ha-Waset” provides a far more informal picture of a group of hunters (fig. 13), although it might be considerably older than the Hunters' palette (Darnelle 2002, p. 147). A group of hunters “walk” with at least two dogs and a few other animals among which a gazelle and a barbary sheep, are clearly recognizable. As on the “Hunters' palette”, most of the hunters have feathers on their heads and tails attached to their belts. Several of them hold a looped object, probably the abridged rendering of a lasso. Weapons such as bows or mace heads are absent. The presence of dogs and lassos (?), which are essential attributes for capturing animals, makes the scene more realistic than the Hunters' palette. "The location of rock art has implications for considering the hunters' status. Many rock art hunting scenes occur far out in the desert, often at distances that cannot be covered in a single day. Hunting expeditions to these areas must have taken several days. The possibility for absence from agricultural or other work and the lack of economic importance of hunting in itself point to the elite status of the hunters, which is underlined by the juxtaposition of hunting and military action. The circumstances of hunting required cooperation, and could have fostered the sense of belonging to a group, allowing the participants to strengthen their contacts and organize their interests as an elite group. The return of the hunters, with their dogs and game, could have been an event that attracted much attention. The feathers and animal tails worn by the hunters certainly would have emphasized this. The impact was not restricted to the moment of return, but was continued by the attraction of animals kept temporarily in captivity. Hunting parties would have been an opportunity for elite display, and the religious festivals when the wild animals were slaughtered and consumed would have provided a second occasion for such display. [...] "All in all, hunting was an important aspect of the elite manner of living but not from the simplistic view of food procurement. Hunting allowed the elite to identify, structure and control the environment far beyond the Nile valley and therefore to transcend the daily lifestyle of the farmers dominated by agriculture. The organized life of work in the fields and animal husbandry was the opposite of hunting wild animals in the extreme environmental conditions of the desert or the spectacular hunt for hippopotami and crocodiles on the Nile. On a more symbolic level this expressed control over chaos. The conceptual aspect of hunting was from the very beginning of the Naqada culture paralleled by military victory. Their iconographic materialization became an important element for the establishment of hierarchic social structures."

On some boats, there are depictions of some buildings on boats which are interpreted as a temples and there is one monument at HK 29A in Hierakonpolis interpreted as such[MAJIDBENAM_REF_279_EgNaqa2] On those boats, emblems with the god-symbol as Min, Horus, Neith and Hathor could be seen occasionally (at least that is a popular interpretation)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_280_EgNaqa2] There are figurines, such as statuettes with arms raised up, sometimes named 'dancing goddesses', but it is not known if they truly were representations of goddesses. Dancing was also probably a part of some ritual, maybe connected with funerals or fertility[MAJIDBENAM_REF_281_EgNaqa2] It was quite popular as it is depicted on the rocks, vessels and in the tomb 100 in Hierakonpolis; and as mentioned above, there were dancing figurines as well. There is also possibility of animal or even human sacrifices, feasts connected with the elite (for now. the traces of them are found only at two sites) and maybe even a royal Sed festival. As for non-religious ideology: "The active factors of state formation were encrypted in the cultural codes and concepts of the Naqada culture, specifically in the domain of an ideological, political, religious, social, symbolic, and mythological set of values, and in how this value system was organized, with sacred leadership as a stable axis of social configuration (Andelovic in press; Andelovic forth- coming). In other words, the social setting was dominated by the ideology of sacred power, fully blended with the concentration of economic, political, and military power. As stated by Wilkinson, 'without the king as defender of order, chaos would triumph and everything would be lost' (2003, p. 194). The defense of order, that is, organized conflict, is depicted on quite a few objects of the Naqada culture, from White Cross-Lined pottery to rock tableaux. For example, a jar from Abydos, Umm el-Qaab grave U-239, dated to the Naqada IC period, depicts the ruler with his mace smiting a group of bound captives (fig. 3.2, left) (Dreyer et al. 1998, p. 114, fig. 13). A similar scene from the painted wall of the Naqada IIC Tomb 100 at Hierakonpolis is, according to Baines (1995, p. 97), 'a central symbol of kingship, conquest, and domination' (fig. 3.2, center). It is obvious that even at this early developmental stage of the Predynastic period, 'the ideology and imagery of political power were being actively developed' (Wilkinson 2003, p. 79). Many of the decorated palettes, mace-heads, knife-handles, and other monuments assuredly 'focus on foreign relations, aggression, and the assertion of order' (Baines 1999). Indeed, below its pragmatic surface, the territorial expansion of the Naqada culture might have had deeper ideological and religious overtones, namely the subjugation of enemies (read: chaos) of cosmological order by the victorious divine ruler and his followers. Patricia Perry suggests an additional early and very successful amalgamation of ideological and political power: 'It is likely that the Naqada IC-IIB Hierakonpolis elite employed ideological power [control over systems of meaning and belief, norm and ritual practices] as the principal means of political centralisation .... The Hierakonpolis ceremonial centre (HK29A) ‘materialised’ the role of the elite as intermediaries in an emerging ideological system' (Perry in press). As far as the concentration of economic power is concerned, it seems that the high elite were engaged in every domain or activity related to prestige and the acquisition, and then retention, of a better position in the Protodynastic power 'food chain.' The ruler’s duty was to keep in check 'the opposing forces of nature.' The duty of the elite was to be his transmissive media, whereas the duty of the population was to obey. A breakdown in social order could be perceived as a breakdown in cosmic order. Therefore, as an ideological, religious, economic, and military focusing device for structuring society, the will to sacred power turned out to be the predominant and constantly intensifying active factor in the process of state formation in the Predynastic period (Andelovic in press). As noted by Wilkinson, this was 'to prove so powerful an ideology that Egyptian kingship would survive as the sole model of government for 3,000 years' (2003, p. 194)."

"The earliest instances of retainer sacrifice from Egypt appear to date from the last phases of Egyptian prehistory, particularly the Naqada II (Gerzean) period (c. 3500-3200 BC). In some cemeteries, there is evidence for dismemberment of the body, a burial custom not attested in earlier times. Parts of the body were buried or reburied separately; in a number of cases the skull has been detached from the body and in a tomb at Naqada several skulls and long bones have been carefully laid out along the walls of the tomb. Evidence of post-mortem decapitation has recently come to light not only at Hierakonpolis but also at near-by Adaïma, where at least two cases are known where the victim had been decapitated after his throat had been slit.
