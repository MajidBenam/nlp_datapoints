As with other steppe polities, the term ‘‘tribe’’ was applied to groups that were part of the Khitan confederation but not necessarily ethnically Khitan. In some cases certain ‘‘tribes’’ had only recently come into existence and were linked to other ethnicities, such as the Uighurs (Franke 1990, p. 404)."

Familiar with T'ang protocols, and advised by formally educated ministers from both Liao and the Later Chin, Te-kuang observed such practices as declaring a new dynasty, wearing Chinese dress, and reemploying former officials. ... He appointed new governors, demoted K'ai-feng from its capital status, and established Chen-chou as a capital instead. But Te-kuang did not intend to stay. ... he treaded the conquest as a very large raid, in which public relations were irrelevant and only loot mattered. Perhaps most damaging to Te-kuang's image was the policy of "smashing the pasture and grain" (ta ts'ao-yu) ... The Liao armies devestated the region around the capital, foraging to supply themselves and practicing the all-too-common cruelties of soldiers in wartime. To reward his troops, claimed to number three hundred thousand, Te-kuang demanded from an already overtaxed population cash and cloth to be stockpiled for transport north. Most ambitious of all was Te-kuang's attempt to take north every material element of the Later Chin imperial institution, including palace women and eunuchs, the complete contents of the imperial storehouses, and every last bureaucrat. ... Te-kuang ... apparently wrote his younger brother listing his own three faults in this venture: demanding cash from the people. ordering indiscriminate foraging and plundering, and failing to return the governors to their provinces in good time. The letter, preserved in the Liao shih (Official history of the Liao), describes the "foreignness" of the Khitan: they are raiders (rather than tax collectors) and pastoralists (rather than farmers), and they keep their governors at court(rather than giving them active responsibility in their provinces)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Revolts against Liao: "Te-kuang, preoccupied with removing himself and his plunder north to the Liao homeland, was largely unresponsive to these events, although he did make an example of Hsiang-chou2, slaughting some hundred thousand men and children, and taking away the women." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "The Liao, for their part,did not vigorously defend the territory they had conquered. On the few occasions when they did fight, they did not try very hard."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MnKhitn][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "The one region the Liao seemed concerned to hold was the key strategic city of Chen-chou, which controlled the main access between the Central Plains and the Liao homeland."

The Cambridge History of China Volume 5: The Sung Dynasty and its Precursors, 907-1279, Part 1. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The comitatus of the early Khitan, a Mongolic people, is known from the ac- counts of An Lu-shan’s Rebellion. For a detailed treatment of the later Liao Dynasty of the Khitan, including discussion of its imperial guard corps, see the outstanding early study by Wittfogel and Fêng (1949). “Each [Khitan Liao] emperor had a separate ordo, or camp, with a ‘heart and belly guard’ of 10,000 to 20,000 households. . . . The members of this guard, particularly the non-Khitans, were the emperor’s private slaves, but their proximity to him gave them high status. After the emperor’s death they guarded his mausoleum while his suc- cessor recruited a new ordo and guard” (Atwood 2004: 297). The Liao state, with its five capitals (ordo), seems to have been organized, theoretically, around the ideal of the “khan and four-bey” system. The khan of the Kereit, who were rivals of Temüjin during his rise to power, “had crack forces of ba’aturs, ‘heroes’, and a 1,000-man day guard, institutions Chinggis Khan would later imitate” (Atwood 2004: 296), along with the golden tent (ordo) connected to them."

In A.D. 947 the Later Jin dynasty (A.D. 1115-1234) surrendered and the Khitan state took on the name Great Liao (for the Liao River). Successful Khitan attacks farther south against the Song dynasty (A.D. 960-1279) resulted in substantial tribute payments and a trade agreement that continued for 100 years. After initial expansion the Khitans did not continue to press against the Xia steppe empire or against Korea; diplomatic agreements were put in place instead. The principal challenge to the empire came from internal dissention by several of the original groups of the confederation. By 1114, a Jurchin alliance instigated a civil war in cooperation with the Sung Chinese. The capital was captured and the emperor killed in 1125 (Franke 1990)."

"Herodotus also tells us that the Scythians give each other sworn pledges by pouring their blood, mixed with wine, into a bowl in which they dip a sword, arrows, an axe and a javelin before drinking from it. We may note that the use of arrows in making a 'blood-brother' agreement is evidenced in the case of Genghis Khan and also in East (or Chinese) Turkistan (now Sinkiang or Xinjiang in north-west China): there, as generally among the Turks and Mongols, the weapons represent the souls of men themselves."

Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Limits_on_Power_of_the_Chief_Executive">Limits on Power of the Chief Executive</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MnKhitn&amp;action=edit&amp;section=48" title="Edit section: Limits on Power of the Chief Executive">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div>These codes refer to an explicit or defined right for some group to constrain the activity of the executive in some way, typically through a legal code, but other ways are imaginable (explain in paragraph if other mechanisms found).

"Relations with his neighbors were also of secondary importance to A-pao- chi, for he faced a major problem in maintaining his supreme power among the Khitan. After his election as leader in 907, his plans to consolidate his absolute authority did not go unchallenged. The biggest threat came from his younger brothers and other members of the Yeh-lii clan, who had become the new Khitan aristocracy following the eclipse of the Yao-lien. In traditional Khitan society, succession to both the khaghanate and tribal chieftainships had commonly passed to brothers or cousins. Moreover, custom demanded that the ruler be reelected every three years, when another member of the tribal council or another candidate from his own clan might be chosen to replace him. In 910, when his reelection was due, A-pao-chi failed to go through this procedure, and his brothers, feeling cheated of their own chances of succession, sought to prevent him from establishing a permanent dynasty based on succession from father to son, as this would have ended forever their own claims to leadership. Most resentful was the eldest of A- pao-chi's younger brothers, La-ko. In 911 four of the younger brothers rebelled, and in 912 another plot to assassinate A-pao-chi engineered by the same four brothers was uncovered before it could be carried out. In 913, when A-pao-chi's second three-year term as khaghan came to an end and he again refused to put himself forward for reelection, a far more serious rebellion, led by his brothers, his uncle, and his cousin who was chieftain of the I-la, broke out and was suppressed with much bloodshed. All these rebellions failed, however, and their defeat acceler- ated the accumulation of power in A-pao-chi's hands. But he was not yet a complete despot. He remained sufficiently enmeshed in the Khitan tribal system that he could not simply eliminate all his rivals. His brothers' lives were spared, although his uncle and cousin and more than three hundred of their supporters were executed.

She supported the claim of her own favorite third son Li-hu, the younger brother of the deceased emperor. His claim was not groundless, for in 930 T'ai-tsung had appointed him heir apparent or, according to some sources, as the imperial great younger brother (huang t'ai ti). Once again there was a conflict between the Chinese style of hereditary succession and the Khitan tribal custom of succession by brothers. The empress sent Li-hu with an army to block Yiian's return to the capital. When Li-hu's army was defeated, the redoubtable old lady led her own army to confront the new emperor. On the Shira muren, just south of the Supreme Capital, the two armies faced each other for several days. The crisis was resolved by the mediation of a royal cousin named Yeh-lii Wu-chih (916-72). This time the empress dowager was unable to have her way. Wu-chih and the Khitan nobles rejected Li-hu on the grounds that he had made himself generally hated because of his cruelty. The empress dowager gave in, telling Li-hu that he had brought failure on himself. The confrontation between the legitimate hereditary heir and the late emperor's brother was thus resolved in favor of the hereditary heir. But it was not his hereditary claim that had prevailed; rather, his rival had been rejected by the nobility because he was personally unacceptable as a ruler. Although the empress lost, the Khitan principle of "electing" a suitable candidate was what swayed the decision."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_312_MnKhitn] <span style="color:purple">3.

The emperor, like many of the Khitan nobles, was much addicted to drink, and when he and his entourage were helplessly drunk after having sacrificed to his deceased father in preparation for the expedition, Ch'a-ko, a son of A-pao-chi's younger brother An-tuan, murdered him. The conspirators, however, had neglected to gain the support of the courtiers and thus were summarily executed. Shih-tsung was only thirty-three, and because he had no grown son, the succession passed to the eldest son of T'ai-tsung, Ching (931-69; Khitan name Shu-lii), who is known by his posthumous temple name Mu-tsung.

These were true regional divisions of Liao territory. The Southern Region comprised the predominantly Chinese and Po-hai areas of the south and east. The Northern Region was the area largely settled by Khitan and dependent tribal peoples. Because the Northern Region also included stable settlements of Chinese, Po-hai, and even Uighurs, it was given a dual administrative system. It had therefore both a Khitan Northern Commission for Military Affairs (Ch'i-tan Pei shu-mi yiian) and a Khitan Southern Commission for Military Affairs (Ch'i-tan Nan shu-mi yiian). The southern commissioners were usually members of the Yeh-lii royal clan, the northern commissioners mostly members of the Hsiao consort clan. The administration of the Northern Region was mainly, though not exclusively, staffed by Khitan holding traditional Khitan titles. Its most powerful officers were the Khitan commissioners for military affairs, the prime ministers of the Northern and Southern administrations {Pei-fu tsai-hsiang, Nan-fu tsai-hsiang), the Northern and Southern Great Kings (Pei Ta-wang, Nan Ta- wang), both of whom were members of the royal clan, and the commander in chief {yu-yueh). These men controlled all military and tribal affairs, the selection of military commanders, the disposition of the tribal herds, and the allocation of pastures. Beneath them was a bewildering array of tribal officials, an office for the royal clan of the former Po-hai state, and a range of offices providing services to the imperial house: artisans, physicians, huntsmen, and commissioners responsible for the royal herds, stud farms, and stables. No one could possibly confuse the administration of the Northern Region with the orderly model of T'ang government. It was essentially a great tribal leader's personal retinue, and many of its offices were specifically reserved for members of one or another branch of the royal or consort clans and filled by hereditary selection (shih-hsiian).[...]  The government of the Southern Region was designed in imitation of a T'ang model. It was based, as was the government of the Northern Region, at the Supreme Capital, where it had its main offices. It had the traditional groups of elder statesmen, the Three Preceptors (san shih) and the Three Dukes (san kung) to act as imperial advisers, and a complex bureaucracy at the head of which were three ministries similar to the three central ministries (san sheng) of early T'ang. There was a Chinese Commission for Military Affairs (Han-jen Shu-mi yiian), which combined the functions of the Commission for Military Affairs (Shu-mi yiian) under the Five Dynasties with those of the T'ang Department of State Affairs (Shang-shu sheng) and controlled five rather than six executive boards; a Secretariat (at first called Cheng-shih sheng; after 1044, Chung-shu sheng) headed by a grand prime minister (ta ch'eng-hsiang) and two deputy prime ministers (ch'eng-hsiang) and including a staff of secretaries and councillors; and a Chancellery (Men-hsia sheng) responsible for drafting documents. Each of these ministries had, on paper at least, a complicated bureaucratic establishment similar to its T'ang model, but only the Secretariat played any significant role in political decisions. There was also the Censorate (Yii-shih t'ai), the Han-lin Academy, the Office of Historiography, and various groups of court scholars, all organized along Tang lines.

Each of these circuits seems to have followed administrative procedures appropriate to its own population. The picture was further complicated during the tenth century by the fact that two of the larger groups of conquered peoples, the Hsi and Po-hai, retained a great degree of autonomy under their own leaders and paid tribute as vassals rather than taxes as subjects. Only in the early eleventh century were these populations fully incorporated into the Liao system of government. The viceroys (liu-hou) of these capitals wielded great power over their circuits, especially those of the Southern and Eastern capitals, who were among the most powerful men in the Liao system of government.

They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour.

This Chinese-style myth was, however, far less important to the Khitan themselves than was their own legendary account of the founding of their people. According to this myth, the first ancestor of the Khitan, Ch'i-shou khaghan, was once riding on a white stallion down the valley of the Lao-ho River, to its confluence with the Huang-shui River (Shira muren), where he encountered a woman riding in a cart drawn by a gray ox. The place can be identified with the ancient grazing grounds of the Khitan and the Hsi. The man and woman married and produced eight sons, who became the ancestors of the eight tribes that subsequently made up the Khitan nation. During the Liao dynastic period, statues of Ch'i-shou khaghan, his wife, and their eight sons were worshiped at the sacred Mu-yeh Mountain in this same area, the ceremonies being accompanied by the symbolic sacrifice of a white stallion and a gray bull."

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_419_MnKhitn] “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (śīla): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_420_MnKhitn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> “Living a morally good life thus always brings a twofold benefit: Others are aided and one’s own spiritual development or karmic disposition is positively affected.

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_470_MnKhitn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_471_MnKhitn] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_472_MnKhitn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.
