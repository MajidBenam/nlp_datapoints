The end date reflects the conquest of Tyre by Alexander the Great. (Arguments could be made for earlier dates as well; in approximately 850 BCE, the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II conquered the Phoenician cities and turned them into vassals.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_LbAcPho] This was not the first time that the Assyrians had conquered Phoenicia—Tiglath-Pileser I campaigned against them c. 1100 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_LbAcPho]—but in the earlier instance, Assyrian control was short-lived and ended around 1050 BCE, and the Phoenicians regained their independence. After the conquest by Ashurnasirpal II, the Phoenician cities in the Levantine coast spent most of their cultural existence as vassals of one empire or another. However, the Assyrians and later the Persians gave the Phoenician cities a wide degree of autonomy because of their seafaring skill; they were more useful as autonomous traders who could then be a rich source of tribute.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_LbAcPho])</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> "In 1983, Röllig criticized the “rather imprecise concept of the Phoenicians” employed by most scholars, but argued that “this need not surprise us unduly since the nation itself never developed an idea of ‘Phoenician’ as a national concept.” Most of our inscriptional evidence indicates that the populations others referred to as “Phoenicians” self-identified in terms of city-based affiliations or family ties during the Iron II-III periods; the tendency in presentations of Phoenician history from the past twenty-five years has been to emphasize these city-based allegiances, or to describe them politically in terms of a working confederacy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_LbAcPho]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none: 1200-1101 BCE; vassalage: 1100-1050 BCE; none: 1049-850 BCE; vassalage: 849-332 BCE♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_LbAcPho] Though the Israelite king Ahab is recorded to have married a Phoenician princess (sometime around 800-850 BCE), this does not appear to have led to a political union.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Canaan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "…it was at the end of the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1200 BCE) that certain city states or regional polities appeared thereafter to be differentiated from the relatively homogenous Canaanite material culture of the Levant that preceded it. In other words, the early Iron I period did not witness a sudden “appearance” of something others would come to call Phoenicia or Phoenician city-states; instead the transition was one of a general disruption of other sites and regional cultures in the Levant."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_LbAcPho]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Macedonian Empire ♥</b> Alexander the Great destroyed much of the city of Tyre in 332 BCE, and killed or enslaved the bulk of the population. This episode essentially broke the power of the Phoenician cities in the Levant, leaving Carthage and other colonies to the West as the remaining bearers of Phoenician culture.

Tyre became the leading maritime center, having eclipsed its mother city Sidon…"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_LbAcPho] The two cities were often joined in a personal union, and the king of Tyre would often be referred to by outside authors as "king of the Sidonians." However, "it is Sidon… which emerges clearly as the pre-eminent Phoenician state by the early fifth century, a role which it occupied until the closing years of the Persian era."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_LbAcPho] Sidon was brutally conquered by Artaxerxes III of Persia c. 342 BCE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Phoenician ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Semitic ♥</b>Map on left taken from the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/history-past-to-present/from-phoenicians-to-french-mandate/">Fanack Chronicle</a>.

It is difficult to assign exact dates to this quasi-polity,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_LbAcPho] but here we focus on the period between c. 1200 BCE and 332 BCE, when the Phoenician city of Tyre fell to Alexander the Great.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_LbAcPho] The Phoenicians were skilled traders and seafarers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_LbAcPho][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The ruler of a Phoenician city was somewhere between human and divine. He was not a god, but was the highest priest with a privileged relationship to the city's patron deity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_LbAcPho] However, his power was not unlimited: merchant families also wielded considerable influence in public affairs and, at least in Byblos, Sidon, and possibly Tyre, the king was assisted by a council of elders. In Tyre, between 605 and 561 BCE, the monarchy was replaced with a republic, in which the government was led by a series of judges known as <i>suffetes</i>, who ruled for only short terms.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_LbAcPho][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Reliable population figures for the Phoenician cities are lacking.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b> <i>This polity was coded through pers. comm. with Oren Litwin</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Oren Litwin ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=LbAcPho&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [8,000-10,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers. </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [10,000-60,000] ♥</b> People, per Phoenician city-state. Unfortunately, due to the difficulties in excavating the Phoenician cities, there appear to be no good estimates for the populations for each polity. Markoe (2000:196) tentatively suggests that by the 4th Century BCE, Tyre's population "may have reached forty thousand, if one accepts Arrian's testimony concerning the number of soldiers slain and inhabitants sold into slavery at the time of Alexander's siege." Diodorus reported that over 40,000 people in Sidon were killed when Artaxerxes III captured the city in 351 BCE, with an unspecified number of survivors sold into slavery. Yet enough people remained for Sidon to recover as a thriving metropolis within only a few years.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_LbAcPho] One might suppose that at least ten thousand Sidonians remained after Artaxerxes' depredations. Tyre and Sidon were, of course, the leading cities of Phoenicia, giving us little to work with when estimating the size of the other cities. Arwad, in the second rank of Phoenician polities, was on an island of some 40 hectares; according to the "conventional" (and questionable) rule of thumb of 250 inhabitants per built-up hectare,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_LbAcPho] this would indicate some 10,000 inhabitants. However, classical sources indicate that the island was densely populated, with strong fortifications and an urban core with multi-story buildings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_LbAcPho] We can likely double the initial estimate, in my view.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [40,000-60,000] ♥</b> Inhabitants.

Though he was not himself a god, he did in his own way partake of both spheres: human and god-like, the ruler played a prominent role in ritual, and was seen as the chief priest in charge of his city’s patron deity, such as Astarte in Sidonia and Baalat Gubal in Biblos.” "Gli uffici del culto regolare, invece, erano affidati a un apposito personale, che le iscrizioni ci mostrano strutturato gerarchicamente e articolato in vari livello di ministero. Nei vari culti il clero era guidato da un sommo sacerdote e comprendeva, oltre agli altri sacerdoti e alle sacerdotesse, una schiera numerosa di personale minore, dai macellatori ai profumieri, dagli scribi agli schiavi. [...] Due cariche sembrano di particolare importanza: quella del 'sacrificatore', probabilmente scelto con incarico pubblico e rinnovabile, dai compiti forse analoghi al ruolo del <i>mageiros</i> nella religione greca; e quella, meno chiara, del <i>mqmlm</i>, forse il sacredote 'risuscitatore della divinita', frequente nelle inscrizioni di Cartagine, Cipro, Rodi, Tripolitania. Conosciamo anche l'esistenza di collegi sacerdotali e associazioni a sfondo religioso." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_LbAcPho] TRANSLATION: "Regular cult duties fell under the purview of specialised personnel, which, according to inscriptions, was organised hierarchically. Religious personnel was led by a chief priest and, besides regular priests and priestesses, it also included a host of minor figures, such as butchers, perfumers, scribes, and slaves.

Each city would have its own patron, such as "the Lady of Byblos," to whom temples would be dedicated and the protection of the city entrusted.

point, the Phoenician kings directly commanded their militaries. As with many things Phoenician, the information we have on their political system is sketchy. Each city was ruled by a king; however, the travelogue of Wen-Amun discusses an "assembly" at Byblos that governed alongside the king and discussed affairs of state, over which the king presided. A similar assembly was recorded in the 14th-Century-B.C.E. Amarna Letters, where it was called the Council of Elders. In the 7th-century BCE treaty between Tyre and Assyria, the members of the council are called the "elders" of the city. There was also a larger body called the People's Assembly, which apparently "was made up of the 'enfranchised' population of the city, i.e. its free male citizenry." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_96_LbAcPho] Glassman notes that after the Assyrian conquest, the kings' role as military commanders on land was sharply limited; they were however still in command of the Phoenician navies, a role that often took them away from their cities for weeks at a time. In their absence, he infers, the councils of wealthy merchants very likely assumed greater control of state administration and set up a more permanent "republican" structure.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_97_LbAcPho] We have no sense for the powers of the Council of Elders or the People's Assembly, whether they had explicit authority to restrain the king or to propose new laws or repeal existing ones. However, we can perhaps draw some parallels with the governmental structure in independent Carthage. Its constitution was discussed incompletely by Aristotle in his <i>Politics</i>, and he praises its institutions profusely for their democratic achievement.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_LbAcPho] Executive power rested in the hands of kings, but they could not act unilaterally. A body called the Hundred and Four was made up of judges; subordinate to them was a Council of Elders, also called the Supreme Magistracy of the Hundred. Legislative authority rested in the People's Assembly, and "anyone who wishes may speak against the proposals introduced," per Aristotle. Officials were chosen both by merit and by wealth; Aristotle reports that the Carthaginians believed that poor men could not govern well or devote themselves to public affairs. Scholars of Carthage also note that outside writers often used the terms "king," "general," "head judge", and others interchangeably, and wonder if there were truly an institution of kingship or if that was an incorrect inference by observers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_99_LbAcPho] Perhaps, once Carthage was freed from the rule of distant Tyre, they did away with the idea of a preeminent king altogether. Josephus (1st Century CE) also notes that during the invasion of Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th Century BCE, Tyre lacked a king for seven years, during which time the council of Tyre ruled, and magistrates were popularly elected for short periods. Stockwell argues that by the time of Alexander's siege of Tyre, the power of the council had essentially eclipsed that of the king.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_100_LbAcPho] He assigns to Phoenicia a key role in influencing early Greece in the direction of republican democracy. At any rate, there are good theoretical reasons to suppose that the Phoenician councils had some amount of effective power as a partial counterweight to the king. Ruling a mercantile society with powerful merchants, the regime would have needed some way to encourage cooperation with royal power, and especially with its tax demands, since brute coercion would be unlikely to work well. Thus, there would be strong pressures to grant rights or powers to the wealthy merchant class to some extent, and perhaps extending further to the enfranchised population.

The supernatural sanctions imposed by these spirits through their earthly representatives did much to underpin the feudal <i>keiretsu</i>-like strueture of the Phoenician business world. Supported by the state, temples were centres of trade, banking and warehousing where priests notarised transactions and regulated weights, priees and measures.

Divine assemblies appear frequently; sometimes the gods are called the gods of a particular city.… In the inscriptions cited, the assembly is invoked after individual gods, suggesting that the latter presided over - or at least outranked - the assembly itself.

This may have happened annually, but definitely happened during the coronation of a new ruler[MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_LbAcPho] “Religious ideas were part of the royal ideology. A king may be described as legitimate ‘before the holy gods’ (KAI 4). The gods make the kings rulers (10). Some kings were also priests (13), and some queens were also priestesses (14). Kings were responsible for building or rebuilding temples (14).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_LbAcPho] Referring to the city of Byblos: “The kings emphasize their righteous conduct in the hope of long life from the goddess (<i>sdq</i>, <i>ysr</i>, <i>KAI</i> 4.6-7; <i>sdq</i>, KAI 10.9). Divine-name components of the royal names are formed with <i>bl</i> or <i>mlk</i>, e.g. Ittobaal (‘With-him-is-Baal’) Yehimilk (‘the king lives!’).

Apparently, this ritual could only be carried out with royal children.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_170_LbAcPho] This is consistent with Phoenicia's Canaanite heritage, as there is considerable evidence from Egyptian monuments and literary sources that the Canaanites had similar rites of human sacrifice.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_171_LbAcPho] The Hebrew Bible also describes instances of human sacrifice, particularly by the kings of the Northern Kingdom (which was heavily influenced by Phoenicia).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_172_LbAcPho][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the absence of archaeological evidence from Phoenicia proper, many scholars have tried to draw inferences from Carthage, which “preserved several archaic aspects of the religion of its mother city, Tyre” but also “took an independent course” in the fifth century BC.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_173_LbAcPho] According to Classical sources, the Carthaginians specifically practiced infant sacrifice, but, given Roman bias against their North African rivals, it is possible that these sources are unreliable—or, at least, that “such sacrifices were exceptional and exaggerated by hostile writers.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_174_LbAcPho] As for archaeological evidence, remains from the Tophet of Carthage, an infant cremation burial ground, have been analysed by both Schwartz et al. and Smith et al., and each team reached different conclusions: very briefly, the former believe that the Tophet of Carthage was simply a burial ground for children who had died prior to birth [MAJIDBENAM_REF_175_LbAcPho], while the latter believe that the children buried there were indeed sacrificed [MAJIDBENAM_REF_176_LbAcPho] (Kathryn Meyers Emery provides a good, clear summary of the debate as of 2012 at her respected Bones Don’t Lie blog [MAJIDBENAM_REF_177_LbAcPho]). However, a later analysis published in 2013 seems to have demonstrated conclusively that the Tophet of Carthage was indeed used for human sacrifice.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_178_LbAcPho][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The earliest unambiguous archaeological record for human sacrifice by Phoenicians (though not in Phoenicia) are two inscriptions from Malta dating to the sixth century BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_179_LbAcPho]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of an out-group member ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of an in-group member ♣ {present; unknown} ♥</b> See above.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of a low-status individual ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of a criminal ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of a high status individual ♣ {present; unknown} ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of a relative ♣ {inferred present; unknown} ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of other ♣ unknown ♥</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital Punishment for Religious Offenses ♣ unknown ♥</b> Though it is highly likely, as many surrounding religions would execute religious offenders.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital Punishment for Witchcraft ♣ unknown ♥</b></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Influential figure forbids human sacrifice for in-group member ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Influential figure forbids human sacrifice universally ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Official cult forbids human sacrifice for in-group member ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Official cult forbids human sacrifice universally ♣ {present; unknown} ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_precepts_concerning_morality.2Fsupernatural_beings">Normative Ideological precepts concerning morality/supernatural beings</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=LbAcPho&amp;action=edit&amp;section=70" title="Edit section: Normative Ideological precepts concerning morality/supernatural beings">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Omniscient supernatural beings ♣ absent ♥</b> Though there is a relative abundance of information on the Phoenician pantheon [MAJIDBENAM_REF_180_LbAcPho], none of the sources mentions whether any deity was thought to be omniscient.

[...] Each city had its own specific pantheon, with a patron god or goddess, usually associated with a partner, and a number of other deities, each dedicated to a field, such as health, magic, war, and so on.

(1) The king’s status as intermediary between humans and gods. “Il re occupa di fatto una posizione strategica di intermediario fra la sfera divina e quella umana. Partecipa a modo suo, pur non essendo divinizzato, a entrambe le condizioni: umano e divino, svolge nelle pratiche rituali un ruolo di spicco, come sacerdote della divinta’ poliade, as esempio di Astarte a Sidone o della Baalat Gubal a Biblo.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_187_LbAcPho] TRANSLATION: “The ruler occupied a strategic intermediary position between the divine sphere and the human. Though he was not himself a god, he did in his own way partake of both spheres: human and god-like, the ruler played a prominent role in ritual, and was seen as the chief priest in charge of his city’s patron deity, such as Astarte in Sidonia and Baalat Gubal in Biblos.” (2) The hierarchical organization of the clergy and temple personnel [MAJIDBENAM_REF_188_LbAcPho].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ uncoded ♥</b> According to Bidmead, biblical sources from Israel provide support for this.

For example, there is a Canaanite story of Anat, who synchronized into Ashtart by the Phoenician period, who fought bravely against the god of death[MAJIDBENAM_REF_190_LbAcPho] Several Phoenician gods were associated with war. It seems that the most prominent war goddess was Ashtart. She is mentioned among the seven principal gods of Tyre in seventh-century BC treaty between Esarshaddon and Baal of Tyre; she is the only deity to be mentioned in a native Tyrian inscription (dating to the second century BC); and, of the two temple that we know King Hiram erected in the tenth century BC, one was dedicated to Melqart (believed by many to have been Tyre’s chief god) and one to Ashtart.
