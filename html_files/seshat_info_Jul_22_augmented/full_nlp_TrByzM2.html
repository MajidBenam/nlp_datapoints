It was this principle which determined other forms of peasant settlements, individual farmsteads and hamlets. In Byzantine rural economy the most important role was played by the typical village settlement in which the farmsteads formed a close nucleus round which the arable land of the peasants was grouped. The Byzantines called this kind of settlement a chorion. In addition there were also individual farms situated in the middle of an agricultural estate.

In the case of the cranial fracture of skeleton 002, such sharp, clearly defined edges could not be produced postmortem in a dry skull. There is no evidence of remodeling or secondary infection. It seems that the individual had not survived long enough for the healing process to begin, thus the injury appears to have been perimortem. The sharp edge, as well as the lack of microfracture, suggests a long, straight, sharp-edged weapon, such as a blade or sword. The depressed fracture observed on the skull of skeleton 014 is not typical of those from falls from high places, or those involving striking the head against a large mass, such as a rock or a hard surface, which would result in a large comminuted or linear fracture. Most probably, this fracture pattern indicates a blow with a small weapon (i.e., slingshot, small club, implement used as a tool). ...

To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." <sup id="cite_ref-367" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-367">[367]</a></sup> "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." <sup id="cite_ref-368" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-368">[368]</a></sup> "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers.

Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor.

"Liturgical ceremonies involve the symbolic use of sensible objects such as bread, wine, water, oil, salt, candles, incense, icons, furnishings (altar, baptismal font), vesture (ecclesiastical costume, baptismal robe), edifices (church, baptistery, skeuophylakeion), and ritual gestures, or actions such as anointing, blessing, signing, bathing or washing, imposition of hands, touching, kissing, dressing or stripping, eating, processions, proskynesis, kneeling, and other postures. [...] The liturgy was usually presided over by a minister in priestly orders (bishop or presbyter) and directed by a deacon who regulated the gestures and posture of the congregation via instructions (diakonika) and announced the intentions of their prayer (litany). [...] Liturgical ceremonies contain both fixed and variable elements. The 'ordinary' is the basic skeleton that remains invariable regardless of the day, feast, or season. The texts of the ordinary express a service's changeless purpose; for example, vespers is always evening prayer. The 'proper' comprises those pieces (lections, hymns, psalmody, refrains, etc.) that vary with the day, feast, or season. Christmas Vespers is evening prayer in commemoration of the Nativity.

"Liturgical ceremonies involve the symbolic use of sensible objects such as bread, wine, water, oil, salt, candles, incense, icons, furnishings (altar, baptismal font), vesture (ecclesiastical costume, baptismal robe), edifices (church, baptistery, skeuophylakeion), and ritual gestures, or actions such as anointing, blessing, signing, bathing or washing, imposition of hands, touching, kissing, dressing or stripping, eating, processions, proskynesis, kneeling, and other postures. [...] The liturgy was usually presided over by a minister in priestly orders (bishop or presbyter) and directed by a deacon who regulated the gestures and posture of the congregation via instructions (diakonika) and announced the intentions of their prayer (litany). [...] Liturgical ceremonies contain both fixed and variable elements. The 'ordinary' is the basic skeleton that remains invariable regardless of the day, feast, or season. The texts of the ordinary express a service's changeless purpose; for example, vespers is always evening prayer. The 'proper' comprises those pieces (lections, hymns, psalmody, refrains, etc.) that vary with the day, feast, or season. Christmas Vespers is evening prayer in commemoration of the Nativity.

To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." <sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup> "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." <sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup> "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers. A series of individual acts or turns were presented: these included dancers, wild beasts, clowns, and on occasion, some of the spectators themselves. Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor.

The idea is already explicit in St. Paul: widowers are allowed to remarry but are not encouraged to do so (1 Cor. 7:39-40). Early Christian writers show a remarkable consensus in supporting that view: the consensus includes Ter- tullian, Athenagoras, the Shepherd of Hermas, Clement, and Origen. In the fourth century St. John Chrysostom composed a treatise addressed ‘’To a Young Widow’’, encouraging her to remain in her widowhood rather than succumb to human weakness and remarry. // Chrysostom's early contemporary, St. Basil of Caesarea, is the author of numerous letters, a number of which were accepted in the Byzantine Church as normative canonical texts and sanc- tioned as such by the Council in Trullo (692). He writes: "The rule establishes one year of excom- munication for those who marry a second time. Other authorities even require two years. Those who marry a third time are often excommunicated for three or four years. And such a union is not called marriage, but polygamy, or rather punishable fornication ... (noevd(av xExokaoptvriv)." This negative attitude toward second or third marriages is maintained in the ninth century by St. Theodore of Stoudios; recognizing that civil law authorized such unions, he forbids their blessing in church.'5 The canons attributed to Patriarch Nicephorus (806-815)16 also forbid the "crowning" of any marriage except the first.17 This principle, which forbade ecclesiastical sanction in cases of consecutive bigamy and trigamy, must have been challenged first in the case of emperors.

But chastity as a notion is often employed to the whole spiritual and bodily demeanor of purity before God, and is not simply referring to the sexual appetites. The curbing of any and all passionate impulses may be enjoined under the call to chastity (which is why, for example, it is included as the first positive petition in the famous prayer attributed to St. Ephrem and used throughout the Great Fast); thus chastity may relate to a right practice of patience, godly conversation, the fostering of right social attitudes and activities, the refraining from gossip and slander, etc. [...] Chastity may therefore be seen as the overarching virtue of rightly ordering one’s life and activities, bodily as well as spiritually, so that the other virtues might be realized and God’s temple, the human person, made a fitting home for its King.” <sup id="cite_ref-888" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-888">[888]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “The warmth of relations between parents and children is often stressed in Byz. literature—in evident disregard for the demans of some rigorists (e.g. the author of the vita of St. Alexio homo Dei) who praised the dissolution of family ties.” <sup id="cite_ref-889" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-889">[889]</a></sup> At the influential Synod of Gangra (ca. 340-342), "The council’s anathemas were promulgated against the following beliefs: [...](14) that women should abandon their husbands in contempt of marriage; (15) and (16) that parents should abandon children and children abandon their parents for asceticism; [...]"<sup id="cite_ref-890" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-890">[890]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> Based on the following quote, it appears that, though bravery in defence of Christianity was seen as praiseworthy, good Christians were not supposed to engage in physical conflict, so that even soldiers, however brave, were sometimes condemned for their actions on the battlefield.  “To the Byz., peace and violence were ideals rooted in the teachings of the New Testament and church fathers (esp.

The epitimion was “a penalty imposed on a penitent by the priest following sacramental confession. The term was already in use by the 4th C. (Basil the Great, PG 32:721A). As a rule these penitential exercises, mentioned in Byz. canonical and ascetical literature, presupposed repentance and consisted of prayer, fasting, Scripture reading, prostrations, almsgiving, and, on occasion, temporary exclusion from the Eucharist.
