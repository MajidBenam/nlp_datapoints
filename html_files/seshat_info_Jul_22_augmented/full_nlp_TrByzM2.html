In 923 CE "a year-long wave of persecutions by Muslims against Christians swept through the Middle East.

The Byzantine culture of the period was a military and aristocratic one with palaces serving "not only as imperial residences but also as administrative centres. They were placed prominently in the centre of cities and surpassed all other public buildings in scale and ostentation."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the previous period the Byzantines responded to the Arab conquests with the creation of themes, whose local commander governors could raise taxes, that enabled the Byzantine elites and their thematic armies to respond more rapidly to external threats with the result of less centralized control. In this era the powers of the themes were drawn back: the number of officials within the thematic administrations increased and by the end of the period the strategos, military governor, was replaced by a krites (judge).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrByzM2] In the early eleventh century Basil II brought in a professional army directed from Constantinople called the tagmata, which lead to the disappearance of the thematic armies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The professional Byzantine civil service and palace staff was "relatively small, and mostly composed of humble clerks or custodians", although there were some very rich bureaucrats and dignitaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrByzM2] In the 10th CE the most important official was the Grand Chamberlain, who worked in the Great Palace, and was especially influential during periods of regency or when the Emperor was on military campaign.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A significant codification of Byzantine law occurred in this period when Leo VI (886-912 CE) in six volumes and sixty books (variously called the Exavivlos or the Vasilika (Basilika)) presented in the Greek language "virtually all the laws in the Justinian Corpus, arranged here (as it had not been before) in a systematic manner."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrByzM2] A resurgence of literature began, in the early ninth CE, after the Iconoclasm had motivated copying and reading of religious literature.

In the case of the cranial fracture of skeleton 002, such sharp, clearly defined edges could not be produced postmortem in a dry skull. There is no evidence of remodeling or secondary infection. It seems that the individual had not survived long enough for the healing process to begin, thus the injury appears to have been perimortem. The sharp edge, as well as the lack of microfracture, suggests a long, straight, sharp-edged weapon, such as a blade or sword. The depressed fracture observed on the skull of skeleton 014 is not typical of those from falls from high places, or those involving striking the head against a large mass, such as a rock or a hard surface, which would result in a large comminuted or linear fracture. Most probably, this fracture pattern indicates a blow with a small weapon (i.e., slingshot, small club, implement used as a tool). ... The type of fracture recorded for the scapula of skeleton 011a, a sharp cut, most probably can be also attributed to a case of interpersonal violence, where again a long, straight, sharp-edged weapon,

To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_367_TrByzM2] "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society."

"Liturgical ceremonies involve the symbolic use of sensible objects such as bread, wine, water, oil, salt, candles, incense, icons, furnishings (altar, baptismal font), vesture (ecclesiastical costume, baptismal robe), edifices (church, baptistery, skeuophylakeion), and ritual gestures, or actions such as anointing, blessing, signing, bathing or washing, imposition of hands, touching, kissing, dressing or stripping, eating, processions, proskynesis, kneeling, and other postures. [...] The liturgy was usually presided over by a minister in priestly orders (bishop or presbyter) and directed by a deacon who regulated the gestures and posture of the congregation via instructions (diakonika) and announced the intentions of their prayer (litany). [...] Liturgical ceremonies contain both fixed and variable elements. The 'ordinary' is the basic skeleton that remains invariable regardless of the day, feast, or season. The texts of the ordinary express a service's changeless purpose; for example, vespers is always evening prayer. The 'proper' comprises those pieces (lections, hymns, psalmody, refrains, etc.) that vary with the day, feast, or season. Christmas Vespers is evening prayer in commemoration of the Nativity. The texts of the proper are contained in a variety of different liturgical books."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_471_TrByzM2] "Above all, a Christian was to go to church--not only on Sundays and other feast days, but as often as possible and at least two hours a day. What, indeed, could be pleasanter than attendance at church? Instead of diabolical songs and dancing whores, it provided the warbling of the Prophets, the chanting of the Seraphim, the words of the Gospel. Christ was there, lying on the altar table, the Holy Spirit was in attendance. The church was like a calm harbour in the midst of turmoil. Yet people had to be cajoled to go there. They found the service boring, and only the reputation of a famous preacher would draw them to church in their hundreds. But after applauding the sermon as in a theatre, they did not even bother to remain for the liturgy of the faithful." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_472_TrByzM2] In the absence of a detailed description of daily church service, information from the preceding quote may be supplemented by the following information on Byzantine liturgical ceremonies more generally. "Liturgical ceremonies involve the symbolic use of sensible objects such as bread, wine, water, oil, salt, candles, incense, icons, furnishings (altar, baptismal font), vesture (ecclesiastical costume, baptismal robe), edifices (church, baptistery, skeuophylakeion), and ritual gestures, or actions such as anointing, blessing, signing, bathing or washing, imposition of hands, touching, kissing, dressing or stripping, eating, processions, proskynesis, kneeling, and other postures. [...] The liturgy was usually presided over by a minister in priestly orders (bishop or presbyter) and directed by a deacon who regulated the gestures and posture of the congregation via instructions (diakonika) and announced the intentions of their prayer (litany). [...] Liturgical ceremonies contain both fixed and variable elements. The 'ordinary' is the basic skeleton that remains invariable regardless of the day, feast, or season. The texts of the ordinary express a service's changeless purpose; for example, vespers is always evening prayer. The 'proper' comprises those pieces (lections, hymns, psalmody, refrains, etc.) that vary with the day, feast, or season. Christmas Vespers is evening prayer in commemoration of the Nativity. The texts of the proper are contained in a variety of different liturgical books."

To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_512_TrByzM2] "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_513_TrByzM2] "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers. A series of individual acts or turns were presented: these included dancers, wild beasts, clowns, and on occasion, some of the spectators themselves. Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor. It is not certain how these activities evolved over the years, but they were recorded as an important and popular part of the festivities during the tenth century."

A resurgence of literature began, in the early ninth CE, after the Iconoclasm had motivated copying and reading of religious literature. Intellectuals began to receive government positions under "iconoclast emperors". Emperor Theophilus founded Magnaura Palace school, "the empire's first known public school since the reign of Heraclius."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_695_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 10th CE the most important official was the Grand Chamberlain, who worked in the Great Palace, and was especially influential during periods of regency or when the Emperor was on military campaign. Within the civil administration a postal logothete dealt with diplomacy and domestic security, general logothete with taxation, and a military logothete the army pay roll. The great curator managed imperial property. The quaestor was a legal official.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_696_TrByzM2] Civil service and palace staff was "relatively small, and mostly composed of humble clerks or custodians", however there were some very rich bureaucrats and dignitaries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_697_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Most estates of civil officials grew up in the Balkans part of the empire."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_698_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"East Roman society, however, was built not only on Roman legal and governmental institutions; it rested also on the incomparable heritage of Hellenic civilization and on the religious traditions of Judaism as Christianity interpreted them."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_699_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]sakellarios (general fiscal supervisor) "In Constantinople, new offices and new actors emerged out of the old structures. For example, the sakellarios, at the head of the Sakellion, formerly a department of the Sacrum Cubiculum, became the chief officer of finance (Brandes 2002: 427-79; Haldon 1990:376-402)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_700_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Under Constantine IX in mid-11th CE the civil aristocracy was dominant. The military aristocracy was powerful in the provinces. "this period witnessed the continued growth of large land-holdings and the tendency of the state to surrender some of its prerogatives to the dynatoi. Most notably, the landowners were increasingly given grants of exkousseia, which exempted them from the payment of taxes, and many were also granted judicial immunity, so that all legal disputes among individuals living on their land would be settled in their courts. In this respect, the landed aristocracy effectively escaped the control of the state. Even where the state maintained control, its functioning was restricted - or we might even say 'privatized' - by developments such as the increasing reliance on tax farming, a system by which individuals or corporations formed for this purpose essentially purchased the right to collect taxes in certain areas: they paid a set sum to the state and then attempted to raise more than that amount from the hapless peasants."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_701_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]first hints of pronoia system "that bears some resemblance to the western European feudal system ... A grant of pronoia (the word means a benefit or a gift) meant that an individual was given a portion of state-owned land in return for some specified service that the grantee rendered to the state. In return, the grantee - the pronoiar - was free to use the territory as he saw fit and to collect all the revenues from the land and any taxes due from it. This system effectively alienated territories from state control ... The pronoia system came into existence by the middle of the eleventh century, but it was not immediately widespread."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_702_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]pronoia differed from western feudalism because: 1. "the concept of the state never disappeared from Byzantium", "the pronoiars acknowledged the theoretical sovereignty of the emperor." 2. the grant of pronoia was in theory time limited and "not supposed to be transferable either by grant or inheritance" 3. a pronoia was not divisible ...[MAJIDBENAM_REF_703_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Praktikon: "Document drawn up by fiscal officials  listing obligations of tenants on an estate or estates."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_704_TrByzM2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Pronoia: "Attribution of fiscal revenues, usually to a soldier in return for military service.

Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms. It was taken for granted that the universe was designed in such a way that some of God’s creatures were intended to be at the topand some below them. Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality.

The idea is already explicit in St. Paul: widowers are allowed to remarry but are not encouraged to do so (1 Cor. 7:39-40). Early Christian writers show a remarkable consensus in supporting that view: the consensus includes Ter- tullian, Athenagoras, the Shepherd of Hermas, Clement, and Origen. In the fourth century St. John Chrysostom composed a treatise addressed ‘’To a Young Widow’’, encouraging her to remain in her widowhood rather than succumb to human weakness and remarry. // Chrysostom's early contemporary, St. Basil of Caesarea, is the author of numerous letters, a number of which were accepted in the Byzantine Church as normative canonical texts and sanc- tioned as such by the Council in Trullo (692). He writes: "The rule establishes one year of excom- munication for those who marry a second time. Other authorities even require two years. Those who marry a third time are often excommunicated for three or four years. And such a union is not called marriage, but polygamy, or rather punishable fornication ... (noevd(av xExokaoptvriv)." This negative attitude toward second or third marriages is maintained in the ninth century by St. Theodore of Stoudios; recognizing that civil law authorized such unions, he forbids their blessing in church.'5 The canons attributed to Patriarch Nicephorus (806-815)16 also forbid the "crowning" of any marriage except the first.17 This principle, which forbade ecclesiastical sanction in cases of consecutive bigamy and trigamy, must have been challenged first in the case of emperors. In the ninth century Theodore of Stoudios deplores the evil example of Emperor Constantine V Copronymos, who was married three times.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_841_TrByzM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious thought reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The Byzantine Empire maintained a network of philanthropic institutions designed to shelter travellers and homeless migrants (‘’xenoi’’), provide free medical care for the ill, nurture orphans, and organize food allotments during famines (Constantelos 1991: 113).

It refers, most often, to the restraining of the specifically sexual appetites of the body, reflecting the word’s Latin root, ‘’castus’’ (‘pure’) which also has from ancient times retained a meaning of abstinence from sexual and other sensual activities. [...] With respect to sexual purity, chastity may refer in practical terms either to a complete abstention from all sexual activity (as in the case of monastics, or as the Orthodox Church expects of all persons prior to marriage), or to the right ordering and sacred engagement of the sexual appetites within the sacramental bond of married life. But chastity as a notion is often employed to the whole spiritual and bodily demeanor of purity before God, and is not simply referring to the sexual appetites. The curbing of any and all passionate impulses may be enjoined under the call to chastity (which is why, for example, it is included as the first positive petition in the famous prayer attributed to St. Ephrem and used throughout the Great Fast); thus chastity may relate to a right practice of patience, godly conversation, the fostering of right social attitudes and activities, the refraining from gossip and slander, etc. [...] Chastity may therefore be seen as the overarching virtue of rightly ordering one’s life and activities, bodily as well as spiritually, so that the other virtues might be realized and God’s temple, the human person, made a fitting home for its King.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_888_TrByzM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “The warmth of relations between parents and children is often stressed in Byz. literature—in evident disregard for the demans of some rigorists (e.g. the author of the vita of St. Alexio homo Dei) who praised the dissolution of family ties.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_889_TrByzM2] At the influential Synod of Gangra (ca. 340-342), "The council’s anathemas were promulgated against the following beliefs: [...](14) that women should abandon their husbands in contempt of marriage; (15) and (16) that parents should abandon children and children abandon their parents for asceticism; [...]"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_890_TrByzM2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> Based on the following quote, it appears that, though bravery in defence of Christianity was seen as praiseworthy, good Christians were not supposed to engage in physical conflict, so that even soldiers, however brave, were sometimes condemned for their actions on the battlefield.  “To the Byz., peace and violence were ideals rooted in the teachings of the New Testament and church fathers (esp.

His staff included a range of powerful officials whose responsibilities ranged from fortification to street cleaning, from maintenance for baths and the hippodrome to water management. They sponsored markets and churches, monitored the scales, measurements and weights, issued regulations for buildings and guilds, maintained public order and provided a response to fires. The Praetorium was also the main police station which was close to courts and a prison. Legatarioi were officials who had a role in policing. They wee appointed by the exarch (with the emperor’s approval). Their duties included interdiction of smuggled goods and registering foreigners who entered Constantinople and ensured they did not stay more than 3 months.
