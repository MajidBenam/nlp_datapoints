Tahir ordered it to be pulled down and rebuilt This was begun on Saturday 18th Shawwal 897/1482, its reconstruction began on sunday 25th. A splendid building was erected the like of which has never been seen. It was overseen by the mu'allim , 'Alf b. Husayn al-Mi"mar known as Al-'Akbaz, who was from a mountain tribe. He raised it up to the height of seven adhra" and built a front hall birilt on pillars (muqaddam) over the first building. The two wings and the rear prayer haU (al-mu*akhkhir) he constructed out of broad arches (asatin fasihah) on baked brick columns (a*midah min al-aiur) and gypsum (niirah). At the entrance of the northern portico (riwaq). he added a court (shamsiyyah) and he added the remaining porticos to widen the court. This increased the size of the mosque greatly. The part one entered from the northern portico in the front of the mosque was called a ziyadah. The roof was done in a wonderful manner with many kinds of decoration and the walls of the qiblah and the mihrab were decorated in gold and lapiz lazuli and other than that. He placed in front of it [the mihrabi two great domes to the east and west and these were embellished with different kinds of decoration. The eastern dome had a lot of gold and lapis. He added two wooden walls (da^irin) and doors and a locked place (gh- Iq-an) where the sultan could pray ... Some of my learned friends told me that when it was finished, the building included 270 arches, 90 wooden columns, 140 pillars (da'a'im) made of brick and plaster on which sat the arches, 12 domes, 13 doors, 5 of which were the principal ones. Two staircases were constructed at the door on the qiblah side and the eastern door from which one ascended to the two doors mentioned above. He also installed 40 iron windows and 7 chambers (maqasir). ... The mosque was the height of beauty and perfection and this can be attributed to the concern of the sultan, his good intensions and he created this for the sight of God and in the hope of his mercy.

He prevented them access to the palm groves of Zabid and returned them to their original owners, who are not specified, for they had been in Qurashi hands since the time of the Rasulids."*' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_172_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1457 AD: Not content with al-Shihr, Abu Dujanah decided to seize Aden as well and, in 861/1457 in collusion with one of the chiefs of the Yafi'i tribe, Mubarak al-Thabiti", he arrived off the coast of Aden with several ships.'" The attack was planned for a time when neither of the Tahirid sultans was in the town. Aba Dujahah was thwarted by two factors: the presence of Shaykh'Alfb, Sufymi in the area, who posted guards on the walls and sent immediately for the sultan al-Malik al-Zafir, The second factor against him was the weather, A strong wind rose up and caused a number of his ships to break up and sink. In retreat, Abii Dujahah's own ship capsized and was wrecked off the coast; He was captured by the sultan's forces and mounted on a camel in disgrace, and was paraded through the streets of Aden, Both his nephew and the Yafi'f chief who had aided him were killed. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_173_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1457-81 AD: References to these struggles begin in 861/ 1457 with the recapture by Xbbas b. al-Jalal b. Abd al-Baqfal-HubayshTof his own area (mikhlaf) in Dhu Jiblah.'* Sultan al-Mujahid, tried to regain it and in 862/1458 he defeated al-Hubayshi and killed many of his followers. The sultan then tried to bring under his control all the areas affected by al-Hubayshi's rebellion: and a few months later he recaptured a number of his fortresses.'* Four years later in 866/1462 the sultan once again recaptured HubayshT fortresses which had presumably in the meantime been reclaimed by al-HubaysM. Al-HubayshT promised obedience in 868/1464 and they made peace. His brother Idris, however, rebelled the following year and this led to the siege of the fortress of Khadad near Dhu Jiblah in which the sultan eventually achieved victory. In 879/1474 shaykh Idris finally conceded defeat and as a sign of his capitulation, we learn that he joined the sultan in a ceremonial entrance into Ta'izz. " Nothing more is heard until 882/1478 when the sultan once again besieged the fortress of Khadad, presumably retaken by Idris. The latter took refuge in the nearby fortress of al-Khadra'. The sultan ordered an attack with mangonels and Idris once again suffered defeat.'® The final end to the HubayshT rebellion came in 883/1478 when Shaykh Idris was killed in Aden by the Tahirid amir'Umar b. Abd al-Azfz al-HubayshT. The sultan had given him permission to do this on account of the fact that Shaykh Idris had killed his father. The fortress of Khadad was still not in Tahirid hands, however, and they were not able to capture it imtil 886/1481 during the reign of al-Malik al- Mansiir after a lengthy siege.<i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_174_YeTahir]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1458 AD: 'In 861/1457, a threat to the Tahirids appeared from the Naqib al-Lubayn who took the Ta'izz citadel. He was quickly defeated however by the troops of al-Malik al-Mujahid who took him prisoner, captured about 50 of his men and recovered the citadel.'"'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_175_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1460 AD: 'The first event chronicled in 864/1460 is a major battle between the Zaydis and Tahirids which occurred at a place called Radm and was initiated by the Zaydf al-Nasir. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The Tahirids lost Shaykh Muhammad b. Tahir, brother of the two sultans, and notable among the Zaydis losses were one Ibn Kamil and the "sultan" of the Jawf, Xirb. Mukharish who was regarded by his ZaydTallies as "of equal value...to 100 cavakymen"." "Alf b. MwkhSish was killed by the future third Tahirid sultan, ^ b d al-Wahhab.' The most detailed account of the event is given in the Zaydf sources. Al-Nasir had mustered a large army and had included forces from the Jawf. When al-Nasir reached Rada'from Dhamar, mediation and negotiation began to take place. According to the Anba' however, the ensuing battle came about by accident when al-Nasir's cavaky mistakenly attacked the camp of the Tahirid, Muhammad b, Tahir, Sultan Xmir came in to defend his brother, but was unable to prevent him getting killed. What we learn only from the Zaydi sources (and we must take into accoimt the biased view) is that the Tahirid army was totally routed. The Bughvah and the Ourrah do not recount the outcome. Al-Nasir's forces plundered and pillaged "weapons, silver and gold" and al-Nasir then took control of Rada', A further battle took place in the fortress of Rada' after which it was handed back to 'Amir.5* [MAJIDBENAM_REF_176_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1461 AD: 'The conflict between the Zaydis and Tahirids was to escalate dramatically the following year and culminated in the Tahirids' seizure of San a'. In 865/1461 therefore, there converged on Zaydfheld Dhamar, two Tahirid armies: al-Zafir, with foot soldiers, and al-Mujahid, with troops and the Tihamah cavalry. Realising that he would get no local support in attacking the sultan, al-Nasir fled to the nearby fortress of Hirran with his family and in the night left for San'a*where he began gathering his forces,^' Al-Zafir meanwhile in his camp outside Dhamar received a succession of the elders of Dhamar, including the shaykh of Dhamar, al-Maqmahi, pleading for safe conduct This was granted to them, Al-Zafir appointed his nephew, Xli b. Taj al-Dih, as governor of Dhamar and left for Aden to prepare an expedition against the people of al-Shihr who were claiming independence (see below, CS ). A short time later, al-Nasir, having mustered his forces returned and recaptured Dhamar. Taj al-Dih, its Tahirid governor, fled. In retaliation, the Tahirid sultan al-Zafir planned a two-pronged attack. On the one hand, the alliance of 860/1456 against al-Nasir was revived with the Tahirid sultan al-Zafir, the ZaydT pretender Mutahhar and the powerful tribe of Hamdan under the leadership of Amir'AIT b. al-Hasan. The complexities of this alliance are hinted at in the following statement "Hamdah leaned towards Imam Mutahhar and the Tahirids, while the latter and the imam stood as one against al-Nasir".^^ Imam al-Mutahhar and Hamdah attacked San'a'and its surrounding districts. Cotmtering the attack on behalf of al-Nasir was Yahya al-Karraz, more about whom will be heard below. Some skirmishing took place in which a number of al-Mutahhar's and some of Hamdan's men were killed. The second line of attack against the Zaydi al-Nasir, was against Dhamar. The Tahirid forces once again forced al-Nasii" out to Hirrah causing him in his haste to leave behind his treasury whereupon the Tahirids marched in, seized whatever was in the treasury and granted safe conduct to the inhabitants. The palace and the houses of the B. al-Maqmahf were destroyed "while al-Nasir looked on from Hirrah". After some unsuccessful attempts at negotiation over land and fortresses. al-Nasir headed back to San'a',' A most interesting event now took place which resulted in al-Nasir's capture. Instead of returning by the expected route, al-Nasir turned off via Urqub ^ where he was welcomed by the local tribesmen who invited him in to be their guest. Accepting their hospitality, he accompanied them to their fortress, Haddad, and dipersed his troops roimd about. As soon as they finished their meal and prayers, al-Nasir and his men were robbed by their hosts and insulted. Some of the inhabitants of\lrqub then went to the Tahirid'Amir b, Tahir to let him know what had occurred. The sultan was clearly delighted , rewarded them well and sent them back with shackles and instructions to bring al-Nasir down to him. It would seem that the people of "tlrqub had acted entirely on their own initiative. They could not have been in prior collusion with the Tahirids as al-Nasir's change of route was, we are told, only on the spur of the moment. Meanwhile, however, news of this affair had spread to the Zaydf fugaha'who were most distressed by this. They appealed to the people of'XIrqub ( we presiune them to be Zaydis ) advising them "not to destroy the Zaydf madhhab by handing over al-Nasir to al-Zafir but rather to hand him over Imam al-Mutahhar", The lord of Urqub, convinced, then wrote to al-Mutahhar appraising him of the situation and he personally came down and removed al-Nasir and took him shackled to San a.^ Still supporting al-Nasir in San'a* was Ibn MuJcharish, a relative of Xli b. Mukharish from the Jawf killed at the battle of Radm. (see above, 2 ) His men and the garrison of the town resolved to try and liberate him. Also supporting him, as we shall see, was Yahya al-Karraz and Imam al-Nasir's son Muhammad. Against al-Nasir in San'a^was Shanfah Fatimah who, after being removed from Sa'dah was living in a palace known as Dar al-Kikhya which had once belonged to her grandfather Salah al-Dih and had since been taken over by al-Nasir. A dispute had arisen between the shanfah and the imam over her use of her own servants (presumably guards) which he did not wish her to have. She had persisted in this, nonetheless, and hearing of al-Nasir's capture she locked the gate of her palace and went up with her servants to the roof, shouting support for al-Mutahhar. The fighting which broke out around her palace was led by Yahya al-Karraz and Muhammad b. al-Nasir. They finally broke in and plundered the palace and the shanfah and her daughters were removed elsewhere. Al-Mutahhar was not at this stage in the city. His preocupation was to keep al-Nasir locked up and he took him from Masna'at Dila'*' to Kawkabah and then to the fortress at al-Xnis where he was to die in 868/1464.*^ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_177_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1461-62 AD: Two years later in 865/1461 brothers of the former independent ruler of al-Shihr, Abu DujSiah, defied Tahirid authority and began plimdering ships on their way to Aden. The following year, al-Malik al-Zafir retaliated and sent out an expedition to defeat the rebellious brothers. A large force was assembled and set out for Aden The hire of the camels alone^reports Ibn al-Dayba' in a slightly shocked tone; cost 12,000 dinars. ^ When the sultan reached Aden, he loaded up his ships with men and supplies and proceeded to al-Shihr along the coast road, his ships at sea keeping pace with him. This was not, it seems, an easy task^as at one point the ships lost sight of the army and the sultan and his troops nearly perished for lack of water.^' Faced with this large army, the rebel leader fled. The author of the Ghayah provides two versions of the ensiling events. In the first version, al-Zafir went in and fought the inhabitants, garrisoned the town, treated with the elders and made peace with the lord of Zafar, al-HabiIdr.'° In the other version. al-Habiidi was defeated by the Tahirid general and ex governor of al-Shihr, Jayyaish al-Sunbulf. This last version is from the Ourrah and following this, Jayyash then entered the town and sent news of the ensuing victory with his son, Alam al-Dih Sulaymah, to the Tahirid sultan. Abd al-Malik, the sultan's nephew, then entered al-Shihr and plundered it. After a period al-Zafir himself came in, ordered the pltmder to stop and settled the affairs of the town, appointing Amir Ahmad b. Sunqur al-Yamanf as governor and taking prisoners to Aden. He also compelled the Kathinlord of Zafar to help him." The Al Kathir whose base was in the region of Zafaf, had been hostile to Abu Dujahah since his tribe, the Kindah, had taken al-Shihr in 838/1434-5. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_178_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1463 AD: Nothing further is heard about San'a* from the sources until 2 years later in 867/1463. In this year al-Malik al-Zafir came up to San'a-to counter a rebellion from the people of Dhahban.^ He was at the head of an impressive sized army which included 1,000 cavahy. He fought the people of San'a"" and Hamdan who, it will be recalled were previously part of the al-Mutahhar/Tahirid alliance against al-Nasir. Punishment was meted out in Tahirid style, with trees cut down in Haddah and houses destroyed.^^ In the next year we learn that Yahya al-Karraz was duly recompensed for his efforts on behalf of the Tahirids by being appointed na'ib of San'a'along with Muhammad b. f s a al-Ba'dahi.'* [MAJIDBENAM_REF_179_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1465 AD: An opportimity presented itself when al-Ba'danf (variously described as'aimil or na'ib) left San a*with a large part of the army to collect zakat from Sanhah territory,*' leaving the city almost empty. Muhammad fsa Sharib appeared at Muhammad b. al-Nasir's house and, in the manner of fairy tales, carried him away on a "thoroughbred horse" intending to take him to Dhu Marmar. The townspeople however begged him first to attack the house of al-Karraz, as they felt particularly angered by his role in handing over San'a'to the Tahirids two years previously. Al-Karraz's house was duly plimdered and the townspeople then suggested to Muhammad'Isa Sharib and Muhammad b. al-Nasir that they take this opportunity and retake the city completely. The qasr was then attacked and the Hamdah tribesmen in it surrendered immediately. By next morning the ZaydTs had fully consolidated their position. When this news reached the Tahirid governor of San'a* al-Ba'dahi^ he was overcome with shame. The sultan was beside himself with rage "he ranted and raged and threatened and gathered a vast, teeming army and set off towards San'a * which he surrounded on all sides. They set up mangonels and destroyed the walls around San' a'and the gardens which contained all kinds of fruit and flowers . They caused the wells to be filled up and the rivers to be drained".'" The Tahirid forces also destroyed the town of Shibam Bani al-Stxhaym in which were antiquities, a description of which the author of the Ghavah quotes from Hamdam-'s M l 7' ' I d al-Adha fell during the Tahirid's seige of San'a'and, bowing to pressure from the troops, al-Zafir raised the camp on 13th of Dhii'l-Qa'dah and went home. saying he would return in the month of Muharram. On i\mir's departure, Muhammad b.&gt;. al-Nasir now tried to rally more forces. He sent Muhammad b.Tsa Sharib's brother Salah to the tribe of the B. Jabr and Nihm t«&nbsp;get tribal support but he found that the latter were unfortunately loyal to the Tahirids and Diwar al-Jabti attacked and killed him . He obtained from the San'a'inhabitants 4,000 ilqiwahs of silver to enable him to pay the troops. Now with sufficent funds, Muhammad b.. al-Nasir was able to annoimce that whoever came to join him would be generously rewarded. Many archers came and he also began to rebuild the wall of San'a^^ Al-Zafir returned as he had promised in Muharram 870/1465. In order to force the San'anTs into complete submission al-Zafir decided to cut off the water supply. The destruction wrought on the ghayls is fully chronicled in the Zaydf sources as might be expected but barely refered to by Ibn al-Dayba.'^ Al-Zafir attacked San' a] cutting down the plantations and destroying its strongholds. He then returned safely to his own territory (Juban, al-Miqranah) and from there he assembled a thousand head of cattle to destroy the remaining wells and the streams around San' a! When he arrived at the foot of Bayt Baws he commanded that the ghavls of al-Aalaaf and al-Barmakf be destroyed.'" Al-Zafir also cut down the trees at Haddah "and caused its streams to be diverted".To emphasise the personal culpability of the sultan, the author of the Ghavah tells us that "he took great pains over this, even passing by in person by those working xmder his orders, to see what they were doing".'* After this orgy of destruction al-Zafir returned to Juban on the desert route via Marib.' The final debacle in the Tahirid's attempt to recapture San'a'was in Dhu'l-Qa'dah of 870/1465. While the Tahirid sultans were in Aden, letters came to al-Malik al-Zafir from some of the inhabitants of San' acclaiming to be supporters of the Tahirids, and described as mimafiqih (disemblers) in the ZaydT sources, swearing allegiance and telling him to go and take control of the area. Overcome with joy, he set off in great haste without the approval of his brother al-Malik al- Mujahid.'^ In the Bughyah. Ibn al-Dayba'says that al-Zafir reached San'a'"with a large force without being resolute or firm hearted, and ill prepared for battle".<i> Mixhammadkisa Sharib, the main Zaydi defender of the city, was outside with only 30 cavalry but managed to enter and rally the people inside. A massive attack took place on the Tahirids camped outside^ and Amir al-Malik al-Zafir was killed. The Tahirid army was plundered and dispersed in disarray. Ibn al-Dayba' attributes the defeat to the sultan's lack of preparedness and the loss of their baggage and wealth which they had not had time to impack and which a group of San'anis had taken off. Al-Halik al-Zafir however in the face of both the Zaydi attack and his retreating army "stood firm at the head of the troops from his home territory and they fought honourably imtil death" This suggests that the deserters were the troops, tribesmen, collected on the way who presumably had only agreed to come at the promise of reward. Tahirid control of San'a*was for the time being at an end and Muhammad b. al-Nasir was established as imam, his rule lasting for 40 years.^^ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_180_YeTahir]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1465-70 AD: Following the death of al-Malik al-Zafir outside San ' a in 870/1465 the lands of the Tahirids fell into turmoil, with opposition to Sultan al-Mujahid rising up on all fronts. The Zaydls having regained San ai" and Dhamar, al-Mujahid's next years were spent maintaining order on the Tihamah and constantly on the move.'°° In 872/1467, there were four fires in Zabid substantiating Salihiyyah's view, (above, 4&amp;) that these were no accidents but retaliation on the part of the tribes. Ibn Sufyaa, the governor of Zabid appears to be in charge of quelling the tribes. In 873/1468 there were confrontations with al-Ka' biyyun;"" In 874/1469, with the Romat;'"^ later in the year against the B. Hafis, one of the more serious encounters of this short period. In 874/1470, Ibn Sufyan attacked them and killed their leader Abu '1-Ghayth b. Muhammad b. Hafrs and large numbers of his followers. Ibn Sufyah then captured a number of their villages, leaving a security force in al-Sharih which he fortified, leaving in charge of it Sulayman b. Jayyash al-Sunbuir. Ahmad b. AbF '1-Ghayth, the son of the former leader of the B. HafTs, sought protection in Bayt al-Faqih b. Hushaybar.'"* It was not long however before the security force in al-Sharih was attacked by the B. Hafi^ but it managed to hold out. The sultan then sent a force to avenge the attacks in 875/1470 at the head of which was the sultan 's brother 'Abd al-Malik and Ibn Sufyan. In the ensuing battle the B; Hafilt were defeated with 200 dead the Tahirid Amir "Air b. Sufyan however, was killed . Clearly this attempted to buy them off with a gift of 12,000 dinars which he handed over to "'izz al-Dm b. Hafis to distribute among the tribesmen."'* Unfortunately fo/izz al-Dih, he was attacked and plundered as he went through the territory of the Rimat. Once more the sultan's army came out in force to quell the rebels and peace eventually was made. With this confrontation. Sultan al-Mujahid lost his most trusted amir, A l f b . Sufyan. He was replaced as governor of Zabid by Qadf Sharaf al-Dih I s m ^ b. Muhammad al-Ahmar. His first action was to permit the inhabitants to use palm fronds for their roofs after they had been prevented from doing so for three years for fear of fires ( above, 44 )• Al Ahmar's standing is gauged by the statement that only his intercession in this matter succeeded in moving the sultan where even that of the Chief QadTal-NashirTfailed.'"® was not enough to pacify the rebellious tribe. Later in the year. Sultan al-Mujahid [MAJIDBENAM_REF_181_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1477 AD: In 882/1477 the sources record the invasion of Jfzah by the lord of Mecca. It seems that there was a profound disagreement between the Sharif Muhammad b. Barakal, lord of Mecca and Ahmad b. Dib, lord of JizSi "for a well known reason" which Ibn al-Dayba<i> does not el ucidate. Muhammad b. Barakat prepared to invade Jizah but curiously prepared himself as though for a pilgrimage, with litters and wives in addition to a large army. After a fruitless exchange of letters, a battle took place which Muhammad b.Barakat won and in which Jlzah was plundered, the city wall destroyed and its treasury full of precious books, weapons and robes collected by Ahmad b. Dib's father and grandfather pillaged. According to the Ghayah. Ibn DIb's son fled to ZabiH where he was welcomed by Shaykh Yusuf."' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_182_YeTahir]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1479-80 AD: The B. Hafis were long standing enemies of the Tahirids. Attempts to force them into submission were mentioned above in chapter 3. That Yusuf shoidd seek protection there is therefore not surprising. In 884/1479 the sultan launched an attack on the B. Hafis to recover his cousin and punish them for harbouring him. During this campaign, the sultan's loyal cousin Ahmad was killed.^ Yusuf was captured and taken to Ta'izz then later to RadaVhere he was imprisoned and eventually died. The sultan's anger against the B. Hafis was still not satisfied for in the following year in 885/1480 he attacked them again.^ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_183_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1480-86 AD: In 886/1480, there was another campaign against the Zaydiyyiih and against the "arab" in Bayt al-Faqlh to obtain kharai." In 887/1482, the troublesome Ahmad b. Hafis was captured which was the cause of great celebrations in Zabfd. He was taken to jail in Ta'izz.'^ In the same year, the sultan mounted an attack on the 'AmirTslaves, who had been rendering the roads unsafe by attacking travellers.'^ In 888/1483, the Zaydiyyun attacked a number of Tahirid amirs, Hilal and qadf Sharaf al-Ahmar (previously head of the diwah). and qadTal-Ahmar was wounded. Al-Mansur sent'Umar b. 'Abd al-Aziz al-HubayshT to deal with them and also went himself. A number of villages of the Zaydiyyun were destroyed including Bayt al-Faqlh b. Hushaybar.<i> In 890/1485, the Zaydiyyuh were beseiged by the sultan's forces and capitulated handing over 130 horses, 40 camels and 40,000 dinars and were ordered to leave Bayt al-Faqih b. Hushaybar.'^ There was a further campaign against the Zaydiyyun in 891/1486 in Wadi Mawr under the leadership of Amir Qasim b. Wahban to get kharaj. He was killed as was . Faqih ^Ali b. al-Tayyib al-Najjar known as a scholar of science. He had been in charge of the waqf relating to mosques and wells and there were with him on the campaign a number of kuttab and slaves. The sultan sent a force under Amir "Umar b. "Abd al-'Aziz al-Hubayshf who succeeded in obtaining the kharai from the various tribes.** The latter had been appointed amil over Tihamah principally to collect kharai and, as has been seen, this was his principal activety. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_184_YeTahir]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1485-6 AD: The most serious threat to al-Mansiir's sultanate was now over and the only other member of the Tahirid family to rebel but who was quickly restrained was Shaykh Ibrahfm b. "Amir, his cousin and one of Yusuf's brothers in 890/1485 or 891/1486 the sultan sent Ibfahfm to join Yiisuf in the fortress of Rada.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_185_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1486-7 AD: Also in 891/1486',Umar b. 'Abd al-Aziz al-HubayshT placed two scribes in Bayt al-Faqih b. Hushaybar who committed atrocities and oppressed people and were as a result attacked and killed by Arab tribesmen Carab) of the B.'Atiq in 892/1487. After hearing news of this the sultan sent forces to Zabid. The tribesmen, hearing of the stdtan's arrival, carried out an attack on al-HubayshT Since his forces were very few, he was defeated and escaped to the territory of the Za'liyyuh and remained there until the sultan arrived. The sultan mounted a huge attack with 1,000 horses. He found al-Zaydiyyah empty of its inhabitants and set it on fire.<i> In 893/1488 there were further campaigns against the Zaydiyyiih. This time no fighting to obtain kharai was involved, kharai was also obtained from the Rimat and the Lamiyyuh and 70 horses were taken from them.'^ In 894/1489 there was another successful campaign to obtain kharai from the tribes including the Zaydiyyun which was ordered by Shaykh 'Amir (the future al-Malik al-Zafir) and headed by Muhammad b.Tsa al-Ba'diuiTjust prior to death of Sultan.</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_186_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1489 AD: 'The sultan soon left al-Miqranah for Ta'izz, bothered by the crowds of people there consisting largely of army personnel and delegations of people coming to petition him. While he was in Ta'^izz, he heard the news that his uncles, 'Abdallah, Muhammad and Umar had broken their promise of allegiance, had taken control of Juban and gathered an army comprising members of Yafi" and many of the inhabitants of Juban. They captured the fortress, destroyed the 300-roomed palace built by al-Malik al-Mansiir, houses belonging to merchants, those of Shaykh'Abd al-Malik, brother of the sultan and Amir Muhammad b.'lsa al-Ba'dahf and others. They destroyed houses in lower Juban, sparing only those of their followers. The sultan prepared a huge army of 20,000 warriors (moqatil). and besieged the rebels in the citadel. When Qadf *Umar b. "Ahd al-Salam heard of the sultan's arrival near Juban. he came out to meet him; in retaliation. Shaykh Ahmad, one of the rebel uncles, ordered the qadi's house to be destroyed; in it was a collection of 1,500 precious books. With the news of the arrival of the sultan's large army at-Juban, Xbdallah b. 'Amir had fled to Jabal Harfz,^ and from there to Yafi' territory. The sultan sent after him a force under the leadership of his cousin, Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Daud. Ahmad, the son of the rebel uncle Da'ud was taken prisoner and many of the rebels were killed. An agreement drawn up by Amir 'Abd al-Aziz al-Hubayshf eventually resulted in peace between the sxUtan, and the rebels in the fortress of Juban, according to which, the rebels would receive 40,000 dinars annually from the revenues of Aden and in addition the lands of Jabal Hariz and al-Shu'ayb.^ The seige of the citadel which had lasted 55 days was lifted.^' While in Rada'shortly afterwards, the sultan heard that the uncles had again broken the agreement and Shaykh Muhammad b. "Amir and al-Muntasar al-'Arabf and the son of the lord of Mar ft^ had arrived in Ta'izz and a number of the inhabitants had encouraged Shaykh Muhammad to try and take the city. In Ta'izz was the sultan's appointee. Shams al-Dih Yiisuf al-Muqri, who ordered the people to fight the rebels. The lord of Mar'ft was killed and the rebels retreated. As for the amir,'Umar b. Xbd al-Aziz (al-Hubayshi) who was in Ta'izz, he went out without participating in the fight. This greatly angered the sultan who arrested him after the battle of Suhbah referred to below,^' and sent him to jail. While the sultan was in Rada' he received a visit from the gadi of Ibb. Abd al-"Alim "Abdallah al-Burayhi*' bearing a message from the people of Ba'dah that they needed him to settle the disturbances in that area. On his way he captured the fortress of the B. Sayf one of the tribes of Ibb, and from there went onto Suhbah where there took place a great battle between the sultan and his uncle Muhammad in which the Sultan's forces were victorious. This was a great victory in which 540 of the rebels were taken prisoner." There was now trouble in Aden. The sultan had earlier ordered the expulsion of the tribe of Yafi"" from Aden for their treachery.<i>^ Another of the rebellious cousins, "Abd al-Baqi" b. Muhammad obtained 100 ladders from Lahj in order to scale the walls of Aden and take it, his army consisting mainly of dispossessed Yafi</i>. He was unsuccessful however, Shaykh Muhammad inflicted a terrible defeat on him and he was lucky to escape with his life and a broken hand. Four hundred of his followers were captured, and his supplies taken/^ This was now the virtual end of family dissent. Future minor attempts on the part of the uncles to assert themselves were equally unsuccessful.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_187_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1489 AD: 'The sultan was now able to turn his attention to trouble on another front, the inevitable opposition of the Tihamah tribes. In Shawwal of 894/1489 we hear of the first of a series of conflicts against the Ma'azibah and the Qurashfs. This is interesting as they had presented little threat during the reign of al-Mansuir, all his efforts directed at the Zaydiyyuh. The last recorded encoimter with the Ma'aizibah had been in 879/1474. Taking the advantage of the sultan's preocupation with subduing members of his family, the Ma'azibah had been terrorising people living between Zabfd and Bayt al-Faqih.'"' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_188_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1501-4 AD: 'In 907/1501 the Tahirid sultan, "Amir, began a concerted campaign to conquer the Zaydi held northern territories. He started in Dhamai- and then proceeded on to Sarfa'where he began his siege on 2 Sha'bah. The people of San a<i> appealed to Sharif Muhammad b. al-Husayn al-Bahhal, described in the Oiladah as lord of Sa'^dah offering him some concessions over a number of disputed fortresses.</i>^ The author of the Ghavah. does not mention al-Bahhal here. Schuman considers him to have been the strong arm of the Zaydis at this time. The story in the Ghavah is that they enlisted the support of Imam Muhammad b. 'Alfal-Wushalfand Muhammad b. Husayn al-Hamzi^ amir of Sa'dah. A battle took place headed on the Tahirid side by Amir'Alf b. Muhammad al-Ba'dahf."^ On this occasion the Tahirid forces were defeated and retreated. Muhammad b. al-Nasir, lord of San'a* welcomed al-Wushah~and al-Hamzfinto San'a',the khutbah was read out in the name of al-Wushalf and great celebrations took place; the belief was that the Tahirids had been routed permanently.'* Three years later however in 910/1504, the Tahirid sultan made another attempt on San'a' He had gathered a vast army from among a motley collection of Tihamah tribes,"*^ numbering according to the Ghayah, 170,000 men and three thousand cavalry. He stopped briefly in Rada' and then went on to Dhamar and San'a.' ... the army consisted on 80,000 men. ... The vast Tahirid army (whether 170,000 or 80,000) made its way to San'a and laid siege to it for 6 months. Sultan'Amir started his siege of Sari a on 29 Rabi"n, poimding the city with mangonels and canon (manianiqat gharadat and madafi'.'" Five months later, there was a tremendous battle between the Tahirid forces and the Zaydis, led by Sharif Muhammad b. al-Husayn al-Bahhal, lord of Sa'dah who had been involved in the previous assault on the Zaydfs by the Tahirids in 907/1501; Imam Muhammad b. "Alfal-Sarraj al-Wushalfand Amir Muhammad b. al-Husayn al-JawfH They were coming to the aid of Ahmad son of Imam al-Nasir who was in charge of San'ai' The battle took place at Thafil, 3 miles from San'a'^ and the Zaydf forces were heavily defeated. Imam al-WushalFwas captured and his death in prison is reported later in the year. The ZaydT texts state quite categorically that the Tahirids had him poisoned.^' The inhabitants of San'a'surrendered and were granted protection and the Zaydf leaders Ahmad b. al-Nasir and'Abdallah b. al-Mutattiar were honotirably treated. They particularly asked that Muhammad b. '^fsa Sh&amp;ib al-Asadr, who was directly involved in the killing of the first Tahirid sultan, 'Amir, in 870/1465 be spared, and this was granted. The sultan entered Sana'in grand style and he stayed in the palace of Sharifah Fatimah. The Tahirid army entered the city and the inhabitants suffered greatly as a result. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_189_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1508 AD: In 914/1508 the sultan went again up to Sari a* to renew the treaty and succeeded in capturing a few more significant Zaydf fortresses close to San'a;' Zafai- B. Wahhais, al-Fassayn, al-Xrus and al-RTshah [MAJIDBENAM_REF_190_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1511 AD: In 917/1511 the sultan was pushing forward his borders once again. Under his general. Amir Xirb. Muhammad al-Ba'danfhe conquered what the Oiladah terms magharib San'^a It seems that east of San'a^ rather than the west, is meant as we are told he got as far as a position overlooking Marib. On this campaign he also captured major ZaydF strongholds including Thula and Kawkabah. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_191_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1513 AD: On Good Friday,919/1513, the Portuguese fleet moored just outside the harbour" and a dialogue of sorts took place between Albuquerque and Amir Murjan, the Tahirid governor of Aden, with letters going back and forth between them. At first Albuquerque pretended that he was only there on his way to Jeddah to ascertain the intentions of the Mamluk sultan. A gift of food was then sent down to him by Amir Murjah which was however refused. Albuquerque announced his conditions that the Portuguese flag be hoisted in Aden, his men garrisoned there and if the merchants applied to him he would give them safe conduct. There were in fact a number of fully laden ships in the harbour and the merchants were anxious to unload them before the Portuguese shoiUd enter but the amir refused believing he could protect the town and port adequately. All day Friday the Portuguese spent securing their ships with cables to protect them from sudden gusts and that night they planned their attack. The Yemeni sources tell us there were 17 or 18 ships (ghurabs and barshahs) the Portuguese that there were 20 ships carrying 1,700 Portuguese and 800 "native" sailors.^^ The amir wanted to use his cannon against them immediately but was discouraged from doing so. Because of the length of the wall around the city the Portuguese resolved to concentrate on breaking through at one section in the vicinity of the main gate with scaling ladders.^^ With some difficulty they waded through the water carrying these ladders and placed them against the walls. This is delightfully illustrated in Correa's drawing (fig. 5) However the Portuguese were disorganised and, it seems, over enthusiastic. Too many men climbed the ladders which broke one after the other. The Portuguese were divided into several attacking forces some of which managed to make some headway against the Yemenis. Amir Murjan himself engaged in the battle. Barros devotes much space to the personalities involved on the Portuguese side, in particular Garcia de Soixsa who it seems had been promised the position of captaincy of Aden. One of the first to reach the wall, he had shut himself up in a turret with a group of men and, after it had been set fire to, with great bravery he refused to save himself by jumping off the wall with the aid of ropes thrown to him by Garcia de Noronha, and was killed in the subsequent fighting.^ The attack on Aden which had lasted about four hours, was a failure and the Portuguese retreated, looting and then burning the still loaded ships in the harbour. Amir Muqan's main firepower was on the island of Sirah, slightly to the east of Aden and he fired upon Albuquerque's men as they were preparing to reembark. Garcia de Noronha, Albuquerque's nephew attacked the fortress and captured from it 36 cannon.^ Albuquerque was now anxious to move on into the Red Sea because these were now the last days of the easterly monsoon. This will explain why they did not put in at any of the other ports along the Red Sea coast, Mocha, al-Buq'ah, Mutaynah etc. for example, where," in addition, the sultan's army was waiting for them. Instead, they headed directly for Kamarah, remaining there for two months looting and pillaging before making a second attempt at Aden.^ Albuquerque was anxious to try and obtain the release of aii number of his compatriots held by the Tahirid sultan in Zabid "The chief city where the Xeque (shaykh) of Aden always stays" and he sent someone to negotiate for them, which proved useless. The captives however subsequently escaped.^ Sixteen ships sailed to Aden, two to Zayla*; where the Portuguese burnt 10 boats in the port, after which they rejoined their companions in Aden who had been struggling without success because, says Ibn al-Dayba'the local people had become wise to their tactics from the previous occasion. However, they burnt 20 ships in the harbour and prepared for a night attack but were surprised. During Albuquerque's absence on Kamar^, Amir Murjan had again fortified Sirah. The Portuguese were able to capture the tower and mounting their cannon there, and on two large ships they had captured in the harbour, they turned their guns on the city and on the catapult motmted by the Yemenis on the highest point of Sirah. A great battle took place during which their commander was killed and the Yemenis emerged victorious. The Portuguese had by now lost heart and were anxious to return to Diu.^<i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_192_YeTahir]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1514 AD: There were a number of significant rebellions against the sultan in the period under discussion. The first in 920/1514 took place while the sultan was in San'^ a! One Haydarah b. Mas'iid al-Haythamffled from San'sTto Dathiiiah and there, joined by his son from Lahj they attacked the fortress and expelled the Tahirid garrison. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_193_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1514 AD: Another rebellion occured in the same region later in the year. This time it was led by the shaykh of the Tawaliq. In what capacity he was employed by the Tahirids is not clear but when his request for more money was turned down, he plundered the pastures of Wadi Lahj. The government force sent against him by the amir of Lahj, Wasan al-Zafirf, was repulsed and it was up to the governor of Aden, Amir Murjan, to reestablish government control.^^ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_194_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1515 AD: In the following year 921/1515 unrest began again in northern Tihamah centered around the village of al-Dahf. Al-DahTis south of al-Zaydiyyah on Wadi Surdud. Tribal infighting led to an attack by substantial numbers of Zaydiyyah 6,000 - 7,000 depending on the texts." In al-Dahf was a government garrison under Amir Hisam al-Dih Isa b. 'AlTal-Hajari; who with a small army, managed to defeat the Zaydiyyah, despite their huge numbers, and killed 500 or more of them in the process. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_195_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 1515-17 AD: The next event that takes place is the sacking of Hodeida by the Egyptian troops and we return now to the Egyptian fleet The Mamluk troops were in dire straits. There were no supplies to be had on Kamaran, Andrea Corsali's description of the devastated island has been mentioned above and Husayn had been fully expecting to be as well received in Aden on this occasion as he had been previously in 912/1506. The troups were discontented and 700 of them deserted demanding that they be paid their salaries.'" Husayn having received the unfriendly reply from the Tahirid sultan, decided therefore to provision the troops by force. The ships which he had sent out and which he had expected would return loaded with provisions turned on Hodeida. The inhabitants appealed to the sultan but curiously, when his troops arrived, the inhabitants refused to help the soldiers with food and water such was their fear. The inhabitants of Hodeida then fled leaving the town quite empty. The Egyptians landed and followed them, firing a ccc on ball weighing over 10 ratls causing complete panic. The Mamluk soldiers helped themselves even to the wooden doors and shutters of the town. These they took for the fortress at Kamaran. They returned to Kamaran and there they concentrated on building the fortress and a cemetry.'^ The Mamluks still did not have the supplies they needed . During this time, three ships came from Zayla'(it is not specified to whom they belonged but the implication is that they were Tahirid) loaded with food heading north.'" The Egyptians asked for their contents and threatened the sultan's governor in Hodeida, whose name was Muhammad b. Nuh, that, unless he let them have the provisions, he would destroy the port. Feeling secure with the sultan's troops in the town, he refused them. The Mamluks fired their cannon at the town and caused severe damage. At the end of this year and beginning of the next (922/1516 Abd al-Haqq al-Nizarf, the Tahirid amir, was sent out of Zabid to gather an army whose composition was mostly old and infirm men This suggests that the Tahirid sultan was preparing himself for action. ... Following the destruction of Hodeida, Husayn al-Kurdf sent with the lord of al-Luhayyah a grab with 100 Mamluks on board and, as promised, they were shown the way, and were le; d in the direction of Mawr. Waiting for them there was the Tahirid amir, Muhammad b. Jayyash al-Simbulf The Mamluks were armed with arquebuses (aqwas al-btmduq) which were unknown in the Yemen at this time.^ The Tahirids had no hope of success. The amir was killed and Mawr was taken. Now the Zaydiyyah tribe with their well known antipathy to the sultans, also decided to join the Mamluks, An interesting feature of the activities of the opponents of the Tahirids is this: the fact that it was an outside force coming in to attack the Tahirids and possibly taking over the Yemen clearly did not either occur to or worry them. In other circumstances it might have caused them to rally behind the Tahirids who were at least Yemeni, albeit in their eyes, tyrants, rather than supporting the foreigners. An envoy from the Zaydiyyah went to Kamarah, pledging allegiance to the Mamluks.^^ They promised to hand over the kharai of the area to Husayn al-Kurdf The combined forces of the Mamluks and Zaydiyyah then attacked al-Dahf previously the centre of a serious engagement between the Tahirids and the Zaydiyyah. In al-Dahf was a small Tahirid garrison under the leadership of fsa b. "Alf al-Hajarf Once again Mamluk firepower defeated the Tahirids and they retreated to al-Ghanimiyyah.^^ The Tahirid sultan, who was in al-Miqranah, seems at last decided to take decisive action. Xbd al-Malik, the sultan's brother, was despatched with the army and after passing through Zabrd made his way to al-Mazhaf.^' Hearing of Xbd al-Malik's expedition, Husayn al-Kurdf decided now to enter the fray himself and arrived from Kamaran with about 1,000 armed soldiers. These troops belonged to Salman and were Turks.^ Corsali says that Salman had with him about 2,000 men and that he paid them well. This is in contrast to the Mamluks under Husayn who were badly paid and mutinied at every opportunity. At this stage the Qurrah gives us some backgroimd saying that the Ottoman sultan "Suleyman" (this should be SeUm, Suleyman only came to power in 926/1520) had sent to the Mamluk sultan, Qahsawh, a large force to assist him in fighting the Franks adding that the Turkish sidtan did not know that the Mamluk sultan and Husayn had a secret agenda and had been planning to conquer Yemen.*" ... Once in al-Mazhaf, the sultan's brother Abd al-Malik was confronted with a hostile force consisting of "Turks, Rum and Ma'azibah" headed by Sharif'izz al-Dih b, Ahmad al-DorJ/b from jrzan. A great battle ensued in which Abd al-Malik's bravery won the day and became legendary.'<i> A fine detail is quoted from al-Ahdal in the Oiladah who says that he heard Shaykh Xbd al-Malik saying " I fought on the day of al-Mazhaf wearing a coat of mail, tmdemeath which was an oil cloth. The bullets and arrows hit me, they pierced the coat of mail and when they attained the oil cloth they were smothered because of the wax. When the fighting was over I put off the coat of mail, I took out the oil cloth and shook it and then bullets and arrows, eighteen all told tiunbled out of it"! ^ 'Abd al-Malik remained in Jubayl and then proceeded onto ZaKd with the heads of fourteen slain. In Aden, news of the Egyptian defeat was greeted with joy, fortresses were illuminated and there were great celebrations. However, soon after this came the news of the Mamluk attack on Zabid. After the defeat of al-Mazhaf, the Arab tribes encouraged Husayn to pursue the Tahirids to Zabrd "their hypocrisy [the tribes] became apparent".'^ Husayn al-KurdT promised them all manner of things, and while at Bayt al-Faqih Ibntijayl, the Ma'azibah too came to him to pledge allegiance. Thus Husayn proceeded to Wadi Zabia to wait for reinforcements from Salman Ra' is. The army that arrived at Bab al-Nakhl in Zabrd on 27 Jumada I consisted of Husayn's force o f Mamluks, Ottoman"Turks "belonging t o Salman, Turkomans, and o f the Yemeni contingent, substantial nvmibers of Arab tribesmen of the Ma'azibah and the Zaydiyyah . They were also accompanied by Sharif'izz al-Diii of Jizan and his followers and the Faqih Maqbul of al-Luhayyah. Against this enormous force, on the Tahirid side, were the sultan's brother Shaykh Abd al-Malik and his son 'Abd al-Wahhab with the Tahirid army. After a valiant struggle, the Tahirids were overwhelmed and much of the army deserted. The enemy entered Zabid.'^ "Abd al-****^ was shot but entered the city and took refuge in ii-Dar al-Kabir. His uncle, Abd al-Malik, followed him there and brought him out on his own horse. Having succeeded in forcing his way through the Mamluk troops they fled to Ta'izz with a few of the remaining loyal troops. Also with them was Faqih Xirb. Muhammad al-Nizari; and al-Sharaf al-Mawza'r Both Ibn al-Dayba' and Abu Makhramah say that the l a t t e r was the cause of the dissension (fitnah) and the extinction (z wal) because he had borne a secret antipathy to the Tahirids.</i> The Tahirid princes were in Ta'izz only a short time before Shaykh 'Abd al-Wahhab died on 14 Jumada II and was buried near Shaykh Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Jabarfi,'"" Al-Mawza*^ T died soon after. After the departure of the Tahirids from Zabrd, the Mamluk army entered it pillaging and looting,'"' They set fire to large parts of the city and caused its people untold misery. On that day the prayers were not performed. Husayn al-Kurdf established himself in ^iDar al-Kabir and ordered the army to cease their plunder, but they totally ignored him and carried on. Husayn then arrested and put in irons a number of the Yemeni merchants trying to extract their wealth from them. He even arrested a qadf called al-Muzajjad believing him to be as wealthy as the qadis of E g y p t&nbsp;! O n learning that he was in fact quite poor, he excused him and gave him a robe of honour. ... Husayn went straight to al-Buq'ah and joined Salman.'"' Together they sailed to Zaylrf and were given 10,000 ashrafis. victuals and men '"^ by the Ethiopians, after which they sailed to Aden, where the ships were preparing to depart for India with the monsoon winds. They had already set sail but because the wind was not very strong they were not able to make much headway and were cruising idly. Husayn, with the main body of vessels, set out for Aden while Salman caught up with the trading vessels which were laden with goods. He left them unharmed and simply exchanged his own sea captain for the Tahirid on the sultan's ship. This was in order to ensure that they obtained the revenues from the sale of the goods and he also took the precaution of sending a letter to the sultan of Gujarat telling him that Yemen now belonged to them. The ship's captain was instructed to return with provisions, wood and iron.'"' Husayn al-Kurdf then began his siege of Aden, heavily bombarding the city from the ships. Not achieving much success, he then turned his guns on the causeway that connected the island of Sirah to the mainland. A great battle ensued in which Husayn's forces were defeated. He retreated in his vessels."" The Tahirid garrison on Sirah had asked Amir Murjah for reinforcements, realising their vulnerability. Amir MurjaSi, however, seeing the Egyptians retreating and sailing out of the port, did not see any need and the garrison came back into the town. Salman had observed all of this and decided to take over operations at this point. He ordered the ships back in and immediately took Sirah and began firing at the town. His cannon shot wide of the mark and the people felt reassured. Amir Murjah took the precaution of paying the army generously to keep up their morale, Salman renewed his attack, positioning his guns on the Sirah causeway, shooting at the city wall, A large section fell down but was repaired that night with pieces of madder,'" Very ingeniously the Yemenis threw over the damaged wall splendid garments filled with canvas. As the cannon balls pierced the canvas they got stuck in the madder. After this ineffectual attack, Salman retreated and heard the news that Shaykh 'Abd al-Malik had arrived with reinforcements and camped at al-Tilaj."^ At this news the Egyptian forces despaired of victory such was lAbd al-Malik's reputation after the battle of al-Mazhaf. They removed their artillery from Sirah and retreated once again. For the second time in four years Aden, though savagely attacked, survived. ... The Tahirid sultan had been in al-Miqranah when the occupation of Zabfd had taken place. He now made his way down to Zabfd. There, he was greeted by envoys of the Egyptians suing for peace. They presented their conditions, which were that they would surrender everything on payment of a sum of money and then leave. As this event occurs shortly after Barsbay's meeting with Husayn al-Kurdf at Mocha, we can suppose that this was discussed between them. The sultan was inclined to accept the proposal, but was warned that it might be a plot - we cannot be sure who advised him, but it sounds like Ba^dmifwho, it will be recalled, was the one who advised him against co-operating with the Mamluks last time. And thtis the sultan sent the envoys packing. He then marched to al-Turaybah, ""^ pursued by the Egyptian forces. A battle took place between the two sides . Although the Tahirids got the better of the Egyptians, they were not unscathed&nbsp;: the Tahirid troops were wounded and hungry and the sultan according to the Oiladah. to his great discredit, would not provide food for the army from his own provisions."' On the next day, there was a second engagement, with members of the Tahirid family noted as taking part in the fighting the sultan himself and his son Ahmad and Shaykh Muhammad b. Ahmad b. 'Amir. However, the Tahirid army on this occasion was routed. The Egyptians plundered the sultan's camp and returned to ZabTd; the Tahirids and their supporters fled to Ta'izz. Abu Makhramah obviously had Uttle regard for the sultan, but was quite impressed by Barsbay, whom he says had proclaimed security in the city and did no harm to anyone."^ By 923/1517 the sultan realised that he had problems with the loyalty of the army. For this reason Abu Makhramah says he relied on the Mahrah tribe and his slaves.'" The rest of the army were resentful of the Mahrah as they were paid more than the others. They considered them the "homy spot on the fore-leg of an ass","^ On Barsbay's pursuit of the Tahirid forces to Ta^izz, this resentment became manifest and the army, formed of a disparate collection of tribesmen, began fleeing in droves. This brief paragraph has given us a clear picture of the composition of the sultan's army corroborated by Varthema's remarks in this regard quoted above (112) There were three elements: a core of black slaves; Varthema says there were 16,000 of them whom, he maintained, the Mahrah - although we do not know how long they were in the service of the Tahirids, and disparate numbers of tribesmen who were clearly ruthlessly opportunistic and loyal only to the one who paid the most.'^" The sultan avoided a confrontation with the Egyptians in Ta'izz and went to Ibb. The Egyptians entered Ta^izz and i n a d d i t i o n t o plunderinq and p i l l a q i n q they forced the faqihs to utter condemnations of the Tahirids in the khutbah. The Tahirid sultan fled to al-Miqrahah reaching it a day before the Egyptians and in time to rescue his wives and some of his wealth. Barsbay waited until the sultan had departed and then entered the town.looting and pillaging . Barsbay was then deceived by the Al'Ammar '^', who promised him allegiance and whose territory he had entered. This was a trap however and they killed him with a group of his men. ... the sultan, remained in Lahj restablishing his authority there .He heard the news of attack and sack of«iMiqranah and summoned the tribes, including the Hayathim, requesting them to defend Lahj against "the Turks" (ie the Mamluks) and he went in search of the sultan.'^ The sultan, anxious now to engage the Egyptians, headed for Sari "a . His brother, 'Abd al-Malik, advised against this as he felt they were doubly vulnerable in this part of Yemen, with Egyptians on one side and Zaydis on the other. The sultan's view, however, prevailed. The Egyptians were at this time unsuccessfulUy beseiging San ' a? They caught the Tahirid forces by surprise and attacked them before they had even unloaded their equipment. A great battle took place during which the sultan's brother, Xbd al-Malik was killed by a bullet He had not even had time to put on the protective clothing that had saved his life at the battle of Mazhaf. The sultan escaped to Jabal Nuqirni, the mountain overlooking Sana' to the east, was captured and killed ignominiously, without the Egyptians even realizing at first who it was they had killed. The heads of the sultan and Xbd al-Malik were sent to San a*to Amir al Ba'dahf. He immediately opened the gates to them, but, despite having granted protection to the inhabitants, the Egyptians looted and pillaged San'a'. Many of the'Al Xmniar who had killed Barsbay were themselves killed. The Egyptians remained in San'a'for two months and then decided to make their way back to Zabid.

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life.

[...] In the history of Islam, the first religious waqf was the mosque of Quba' in Medina. It was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad in 622. Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar. When he asked the Prophet what to do with a palm orchard he acquired in the city of Khaybar, the Prophet said, “If you like, you may hold the property as waqf and give its fruits as charity.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_221_YeTahir]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> “In addition to observing various dietary practices, Muslims use food to celebrate holidays.

First, there are at least seven positive commands: to know but one God; to be kind to parents; to be righteous; to give to the poor; to be moderate in spending; to be kind in speaking and to be generous: ‘Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you show kindness to your parents. [...]' (17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_261_YeTahir]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other supernatural enforcement not related to piety ♣ present ♥</b> The most important Islamic virtue that is not captured by other variables appears to be mercy. "Mercy encompasses kindness to animals as well as to humans, for abuse or cruelty of any of God's creatures is abhorrent to their creator. Such virtues are stressed again and again in the Qur'an and in the Prophet's sayings, as in the following hadith, for example: ‘God will not show mercy to him who does not show mercy to others.'" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_262_YeTahir][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Human Enforcement of Morality</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to care for the needy. "Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_263_YeTahir] "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_YeTahir] "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_265_YeTahir] "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_266_YeTahir]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ present ♥</b> Islam prohibits cheating in trade. "Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with even scales (<i>when you weigh</i>). This is better, and will be the best in the end. [...](Qur'an, 17:31- 7)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_267_YeTahir] Moreover, justice is one of the key Islamic virtues: <i>In all their dealings, Muslims are required to stand firmly for justice even if it be against themselves or their kith and kin: 'O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_268_YeTahir] However, it's worth noting that "the adulteration of weights and measures" belonged to the domain of "non-Quranic law"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_269_YeTahir].</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> "Classical Islamic constitutional law was concerned particularly with the issue of the legitimacy of leadership. The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are. Classical commentaries name secular rulers (umara' , sultan) as well as religious ahl al-qur'an wa-l-'ilm) or legal scholars (fuqaha'). "[MAJIDBENAM_REF_270_YeTahir]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> "Modesty or chastity is also an important virtue in the Islamic system of morality for all Muslims, men or women. To the true Muslim, man and woman alike, anything impure or degrading is abhorrent and to be avoided. Strict modesty of dress, manner and behaviour, and absolute chastity are required both before and after marriage. The most famous personal example of chastity in the Qur'an is the Virgin Mary: 'And (<i>remember that blessed woman</i>) who guarded her chastity' (21:91)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_271_YeTahir]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to be kind to one's parents: <i>Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you show kindness to your parents. If either or both of them attain old age with you, (show no sign of impatience, and) do not (even) say 'fie' to them; nor rebuke them, but speak kind words to them. And lower unto them the wing of humility and tenderness and say: 'Lord, be merciful to them both, as they did care for me when I was small.' Your Lord best knows what is in your minds. If you are righteous, He surely was ever Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). [...](17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_272_YeTahir] In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void. [...] Other needy family members, such as parents, grandparents and grandchildren, may also claim a right to maintenance[...]."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_273_YeTahir]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> "Beginning with the classical texts on Islamic law a fundamental bipartition of the world was evolved which would remain - with some modifications - the basis of all deliberation until well into the twentieth century. The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_274_YeTahir]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft. Traditional Islamic penal ordinances (hudud) distinguish between two kinds: al-sariqah al-sughra (simple theft), requiring amputation of the right hand, and al-sariqah al-kubra, the meaning of which is contested but which requires the amputation of the right hand and left foot. Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty. Hudud ordinances are considered primarily deterrant and, due to their strict evidentiary requirements, are rarely invoked."
