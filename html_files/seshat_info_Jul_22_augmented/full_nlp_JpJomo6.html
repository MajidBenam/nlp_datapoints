Given the apparent importance of seasonal change in Jomon lifeways [MAJIDBENAM_REF_75_JpJomo6], it is likely that relatively large-scale ceremonies at large buildings and megalithic structures marked the passage of the seasons [MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_JpJomo6]. Likely ceremonial activities included feasting (as suggested by large quantities of cooking vessels at many of these sites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_JpJomo6]), animal sacrifice (as suggested by apparent ritual manipulation of animal remains--derived from "dogs, wolves, bears, monkeys, otters, dolphins, turtles and wild cats"--at a number of sites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_JpJomo6]), music playing (as suggested by the relative frequency of musical instruments in the Jomon archaeological record, including ocarinas and rattles [MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_JpJomo6]), and tooth ablation (as suggested by the apparent ritual importance of this practice [MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_JpJomo6]). From the Middle Jomon onwards, it is likely that these ceremonies also included drinking, as suggested by the finding of wild grape berries in vessels ideally suited for fermentation at a number of sites starting from the Middle Jomon [MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_JpJomo6].

Given the apparent importance of seasonal change in Jomon lifeways [MAJIDBENAM_REF_200_JpJomo6], it is likely that relatively large-scale ceremonies at large buildings and megalithic structures marked the passage of the seasons [MAJIDBENAM_REF_201_JpJomo6]. Likely ceremonial activities included feasting (as suggested by large quantities of cooking vessels at many of these sites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_202_JpJomo6]), animal sacrifice (as suggested by apparent ritual manipulation of animal remains--derived from "dogs, wolves, bears, monkeys, otters, dolphins, turtles and wild cats"--at a number of sites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_203_JpJomo6]), music playing (as suggested by the relative frequency of musical instruments in the Jomon archaeological record, including ocarinas and rattles [MAJIDBENAM_REF_204_JpJomo6]), and tooth ablation (as suggested by the apparent ritual importance of this practice [MAJIDBENAM_REF_205_JpJomo6]). From the Middle Jomon onwards, it is likely that these ceremonies also included drinking, as suggested by the finding of wild grape berries in vessels ideally suited for fermentation at a number of sites starting from the Middle Jomon [MAJIDBENAM_REF_206_JpJomo6].

Given the apparent importance of seasonal change in Jomon lifeways [MAJIDBENAM_REF_251_JpJomo6], it is likely that relatively large-scale ceremonies at large buildings and megalithic structures marked the passage of the seasons [MAJIDBENAM_REF_252_JpJomo6]. Likely ceremonial activities included feasting (as suggested by large quantities of cooking vessels at many of these sites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_253_JpJomo6]), animal sacrifice (as suggested by apparent ritual manipulation of animal remains--derived from "dogs, wolves, bears, monkeys, otters, dolphins, turtles and wild cats"--at a number of sites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_254_JpJomo6]), music playing (as suggested by the relative frequency of musical instruments in the Jomon archaeological record, including ocarinas and rattles [MAJIDBENAM_REF_255_JpJomo6]), and tooth ablation (as suggested by the apparent ritual importance of this practice [MAJIDBENAM_REF_256_JpJomo6]). From the Middle Jomon onwards, it is likely that these ceremonies also included drinking, as suggested by the finding of wild grape berries in vessels ideally suited for fermentation at a number of sites starting from the Middle Jomon [MAJIDBENAM_REF_257_JpJomo6].

Though religious practices were changed during the succeeding Burial Mound period, many elements of early nature worship were retained. In this first period, people venerated spirits of the mountains, the fields, and streams near their villages, and they related tales that pertained to nature and the origins of the most remarkable features of their environment. People of this period developed magical rites to aid them in hunting, fishing, and farming, and they told tales that explained the origin of these rites.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"[...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Scholars have advanced a variety of theories to explain how the concept of kami originated and developed. The most likely explanation places the roots of kami worship in animistic forms of nature worship. [...] Some scholars maintain that the origin of Shinto lies in cults that venerated heroes or worshiped ancestors, that kami were originally human beings. Indeed, one aspect of Shinto as it developed in later ages was the veneration of historical and legendary figures, or ancestors of powerful families and clans. But as I shall demonstrate later in this chapter, elements of hero and ancestor worship were added at a later time. [...] Finally, Shinto was not an entirely indigenous development. The Shinto view of the cosmos, for example, is a complex and not wholly integrated view that contains influences from various parts of Asia and even Oceania. [...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The search for Shinto's beginnings leads us to the prehistoric Jomon and Yayoi periods. Though there is considerable discontinuity between the beliefs of these early periods and later ones, certain primitive strains were preserved in later religious practices. Our understanding of this prehistoric era is based primarily on archaeological evidence. The difficulty of interpreting such evidence makes it difficult, however, to reach a firm understanding of prehistoric rituals, myths, or concepts of the cosmos and divinity. But archaeologists have uncovered many artifacts that seem to have been used for religious purposes in very early times. For a somewhat later time, fragmentary historical evidence appears in Chinese chronicles, amplifying and clarifying the archaeological data.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The neolithic Jomon culture was supported by hunting, fishing, and gathering and later by primitive forms of agriculture. The succeeding Yayoi culture, on the other hand, was an agrarian culture in which bronze and iron implements were used and rice was grown as a staple food. It is likely that religious practices during these periods reflected, in part, the methods that people used to make their living. Jomon culture artifacts suggest that people of those days carried out magical-religious rites to guarantee the fertility of human beings as well as the fertility of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered. After primitive forms of agriculture were introduced, probably from abroad, some of these rites took on an agrarian nature.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Perhaps the most striking of Jomon artifacts are the dogu, human figurines that nearly all represent women whose exaggerated breasts and distended bellies indicate pregnancy. Some were even shown with a child protruding from the womb. Many have been unearthed near residential sites, and their placement within stone enclosures or on top of stone piles suggests that they were deliberately set apart, perhaps as objects of worship. This has led scholars such as Kokubu Naoichi to believe that the figurines were maimed, buried, and exhumed in magical rites that symbolized death and resurrection. Many archaeologists have surmised that the dogu represent female deities who managed the procreation of the earth and of human beings. The folklorist Hotta Yoshio identified primitive forms of the worship of fertility-mother deities called yama no kami (mountain kami) in hunters' and woodcutters' rituals that linger in the folk beliefs of northeastern Japan. Hotta suggests that the figure of the yama no kami in present-day folk beliefs originated from the prehistoric fertility goddesses represented by dogu. Other Jomon artifacts, probably used in fertility rites, are stone rods shaped like the male phallus. These rods have been found in the centers or corners of rooms at the sites of Jomon period houses and seem to have been objects of worship.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The functions of other items from the Jomon period are somewhat more difficult to identify. Pottery is often decorated with images of serpents, and in later times, at least, serpents were believed to be the spirit of the water that was necessary for cultivation. Other artifacts that may have been used in some form of magical-religious ritual were clay and stone masks, and wooden plaques incised with human forms or carved in the shape of human faces.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Some of the archaeological evidence from the middle of this period demonstrates the transmission of elements from south Asian, southeast Asian, and south Pacific island cultures. Jomon initiation rites that involved ritual tooth extraction and the custom of tattooing - apparent in the design of the dogu - were also practiced by southern peoples. In addition, it seems that the cultivation of taro root was introduced from these areas.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The importation of taro root cultivation may have given rise to the belief in a 'guest' kami or spirit (marebito), who was given credit for introducing this early form of agriculture. In prehistoric times, according to Orikuchi Shinobu, each village probably conducted yearly rites on a set day to welcome the guest kami from Tokoyo no Kuni, the Utopian land of boundless fertility across the sea. As a gift, the guest kami would bring a bountiful harvest, and he was also responsible for introducing and conducting coming-of-age ceremonies. Orikuchi finds evidence for his hypothesis in literary works of later times such as the Kojiki and the Man'yoshu, in extant New Year customs in the Tohoku region of Honshu, and in Okinawan harvest festivals hailing a visitor deity. Oka Masao points out the resemblance of these rites to those practiced in Melanesia, New Guinea, and elsewhere in the south Pacific. The masks unearthed from Middle Jomon sites might have been used by people who assumed the guest's role at festival times. In sum, the religious practices of the Jomon period probably involved fertility rites that acquired agrarian elements, many from other Asian and Pacific cultures, when cultivation was introduced."

The high degree of organisational potential exhibited by Jomon societies, exemplified by the construction of large-scale features such as the ditch at Shizukawa, and the strength of what we might call Jomon cultural power, certainly provided the conditions for the appearance of a degree of social ranking and the accrual of individual status differences within the framework of Jomon society.//For example, in the middle of a community cemetery at the Late Jomon Yamaga shell midden in Fukuoka Prefecture, lies a woman with twenty shell armlets on her wrists [...].

Given the apparent importance of seasonal change in Jomon lifeways [MAJIDBENAM_REF_313_JpJomo6], it is likely that relatively large-scale ceremonies at large buildings and megalithic structures marked the passage of the seasons [MAJIDBENAM_REF_314_JpJomo6]. Likely ceremonial activities included feasting (as suggested by large quantities of cooking vessels at many of these sites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_315_JpJomo6]), animal sacrifice (as suggested by apparent ritual manipulation of animal remains--derived from "dogs, wolves, bears, monkeys, otters, dolphins, turtles and wild cats"--at a number of sites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_316_JpJomo6]), music playing (as suggested by the relative frequency of musical instruments in the Jomon archaeological record, including ocarinas and rattles [MAJIDBENAM_REF_317_JpJomo6]), and tooth ablation (as suggested by the apparent ritual importance of this practice [MAJIDBENAM_REF_318_JpJomo6]). From the Middle Jomon onwards, it is likely that these ceremonies also included drinking, as suggested by the finding of wild grape berries in vessels ideally suited for fermentation at a number of sites starting from the Middle Jomon [MAJIDBENAM_REF_319_JpJomo6]. Moreover, starting from at least the Middle Jomon period, there is evidence for figurine use at some of these ceremonies--specifically, it seems that figurines were deliberately broken and deposited [MAJIDBENAM_REF_320_JpJomo6]. The earliest evidence for ritual specialists, the burial of a woman with unusual ornamentation at Yamaga, dates to the Late Jomon [MAJIDBENAM_REF_321_JpJomo6], which suggests that perhaps these rituals were supervised by specialists only relatively late.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ morality ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> absent/present/unknown.
