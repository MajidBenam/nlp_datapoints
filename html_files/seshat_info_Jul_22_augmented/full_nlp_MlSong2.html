These kings consolidated Songhay power by building on the legacy of their Malinke predecessors and took control of more territories, extending their reach over the Niger Inland Delta, westward to the Atlantic ocean, northward to the salt pans of Taghaza, and eastward to the Tuareg kingdom of Agadez.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_MlSong2] However, the empire was brought to an abrupt end in the late 16th century: after a succession crisis which sparked a civil war, the Sultan of Morocco invaded in 1591.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Unlike the preceding Ghana and Mali Empires, Songhay operated as a centralized unitary state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_MlSong2] The king was a revered figure but his authority was tempered by the precepts of Islam from the 11th century, and this religion became increasingly prevalent under the Askiya dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_MlSong2] The imperial council coordinated the activities of the central government, which was divided into ministries including those of agriculture, finance, the army and the naval fleet.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_MlSong2] The two major provinces, Kurmina in the west and Dendi in the southeast, were ruled by princes who were responsible for their own armies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_MlSong2] Thriving trading towns like Jenné, Timbuktu, Teghazza and Walata enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy due to the power of guilds and local chiefs, but had to report to a superintendent, tax inspectors, customs officials and other state appointees.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_MlSong2] Vassal and tributary countries also bowed before the power of the Askiya when disputes arose.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Songhay empire is associated with the establishment of high centres of learning in Jenné, Dia, Gao and Timbuktu. The latter in particular was famed for its university, holy men, doctors and teachers, who contributed to the spread of Islamic humanism among the urban elite in the region from the 15th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_MlSong2] The rural Songhay continued to venerate a pantheon of divinities and local spirits until Islam penetrated the countryside via the peaceful incursions of traders and government-sponsored marabouts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is difficult to find substantiated population estimates for the Songhay Empire, but one scholar believes there could have been 70,000 people living in the city of Timbuktu by 1580 under Askiya Daoud.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Songhai Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Songhay_1500CE: 1493CE-1591CE ♥</b>  Songhay_1500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  799004: 1493CE-1591CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Songhay ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Songhay ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Songhay ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Sunni Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Sahel Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Songhai Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MlSong2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [600,000-700,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Songhay and tributary states" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_MlSong2] - for this period including also the Mande tributary states.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Territory expanded westward under Muhammad Ture (1493-1528 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Askia Muhammed Toure (r.1493-1529 CE) conquered more territories beyond the Niger Inland Delta, "eastward to the Tuareg kingdom of Agadez" and "northward to the salt pans of Taghaza" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Songhai Empire extended from east of the Niger River as far as the Atlantic Ocean and 'from the frontiers of the land of Bindoko as far as Teghezza and its dependencies' under Askia Mohammed."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [4,000,000-5,000,000] ♥</b> People.

The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba. Furthermore, it is important to remember that almost all reform movements in the fringe areas of the Islamic world were triggered off by the pilgrimage. Faithful believers from Bengal and Nigeria, from Morocco and Central Asia, who had lived for some time in Mecca and exchanged their views with others who, like them, had experienced what seemed to be the 'true Arabic Islam', returned to their Page 39countries to fight the numerous indigenous superstitions and customs which had infiltrated the Islam of the masses and which now appeared to them like remnants of ancient paganism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_239_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, although "a pilgrim can start going into consecration (<i>ihram</i>) for Hajj earlier, from the beginning of the tenth month (Shawwal)".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_240_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_241_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> The inhabitants of Mecca, Medina and other important waypoints along the pilgrimage may be considered as "passive spectators or witnesses", as the Seshat codebook puts it.

It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_278_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> Every Friday.

However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_315_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> Every Friday.

Descriptions of the festival are surprisingly rare, especially as regards how it was celebrated in the past, but given that most Islamic practices demonstrate a great degree of continuity with the past, so descriptions of how the festival is celebrated in modern times may apply to how it was celebrated in the past as well. 'Id al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of the month-long Islamic fast known as Ramadan. "As in the Friday afternoon congregational prayer of the weekly Day of Assembly, the Eid morning prayers at the mosque should be preceded by a bath and attended with clean (often new) clothes. After breakfast, men, women, and children gather at an outdoor prayer meeting, the <i>musallah</i>, in front of a white wall adorned with a niche, the <i>mihraab</i> pointing in the direction of Mecca (like the one in every mosque). Women are given the option of praying at home--as they mostly do the rest of the year. The prayers consist of two units (<i>rakat</i>) plus the six-to-sixteen additional <i>takbir</i> recitations of <i>Allahu Akbar</i> ('God is Most Great'). These set them apart from Friday prayers, as does the fact that they are followed instead of preceded by a two-part sermon (<i>khutba</i>). [...] This enthusiasm erupts spontaneously on the aptly named <i>Eid-al-Fitr</i>, the festival of the breaking of the month-long Ramadan fast. Still, by then, passions have been so well trained that few unbridled excesses are in evidence at the happy family celebrations of warm community that follow or at the fairground attractions that are set up in some places [...]. Indeed, restored social harmony is on display everywhere over up to three days, with people greeting and congratulating each other in the streets as well as on afternoon visits to relatives, friends, and sick people. Many gifts are offered, particularly to the children of less fortunate families. At home, the family celebrates around a noontime festive meal [...]. Dead relatives are also remembered as their graves are visited that day." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_353_MlSong2] There is also a specific type of charity given on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr, known as Zakat-ul-Fitr [MAJIDBENAM_REF_354_MlSong2].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠

Circumcision was an important rite of passage for boys in early twentieth-century Soghay society, one that combined Muslim traditions with ones that preceded the arrival of Islam in the region, so it is reasonable to infer that it was similarly important at this time. Only through circumcision could a boy become a man, and therefore marry and join an important type of mutual aid group known as a <i>kondey</i>. The ceremony was rather elaborate but may be summarised as follows. The ritual occurred every few years and usually involved more than a hundred boys. One of the fathers, usually a particularly wealthy one, would organise the ceremonies and bear the brunt of the expenses, thus gaining much prestige. On a Monday, the boys gather in a specially prepared house, with their relatives, and they are treated to a feast. Then they are given charms to wear, and their hands are hennaed. There is drumming, dancing, and singing, and eventually the boys' relatives leave. Then the actual circumcision is carried out by "barbers" wearing deliberately frightening face paint. After the circumcision, the boys stay in the house for two weeks to heal, eat nice meals, and generally do as they wish. They regularly play music and sing a circumcision song. There are a couple of ceremonies in which the boys are bathed and their bandages are changed. At the end, before re-entering society, they are given many gifts. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_389_MlSong2] NOTE: This source is quite old, but it provides an eyewitness account of the ritual as it was performed in the early twentieth century, and there is little to suggest that it is unreliable.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> every 2-3 years .

The ruling family had 24 slave tribes: they were functionally specialised and tasked to produce crops to feed king's army, fodder for his horses, or grow or farm produce, like fish; still other tribes were blacksmiths ("of foreign extraction"); five tribes were obliged to provide "one hundred spears and one hundred arrows per family each year" for the army; from one tribe the king recruited "domestic servants and confidential special emissaries" (but otherwise was exempt from a tax).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_481_MlSong2] The slave tribes "had all the external appearances of a clan or tribe, as to number, identity of name, and collateral relationships. Yet they totally lacked the social structure and organization of the clan."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_482_MlSong2] Plantations worked by slaves were managed by a fanfa (slave-master or ship-master) who might be responsible for 100, 60, 50, 40, or 20 slaves.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_483_MlSong2] A plantation in Dendi had 200 slaves and four fanfas under a leader called Missakulallah, who was also a slave.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_484_MlSong2] The state gained tribute from conquered peoples, such as Maghcharen-Koi and Andassen-Koi Berbers who "each were obliged to provide 12,000 soldiers in case of war"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_485_MlSong2] and the Katsina and Hausa states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_486_MlSong2] Revenue was gained from taxation on merchants in gold coins or goods[MAJIDBENAM_REF_487_MlSong2] and from customs duties on imports and exports, which had existed from the Ghanaian period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_488_MlSong2] In general terms, the West African states were ruled by a non-landowning who nobility lived on "the institution of a tax, first conceived of as a tithe, a ritual deduction on the wealth of all subjects".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_489_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The bureaucracy was closely linked to the court and under the Songhai Askias became very well developed. Each high official, directly appointed by the king[MAJIDBENAM_REF_490_MlSong2], was given a "distinctive uniform and insignia" which were worn at royal audiences, and they sat together in a highly-formalised assembly.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_491_MlSong2] The king wore a headdress at royal audiences[MAJIDBENAM_REF_492_MlSong2] and his rank obligated him to speak softly so "the Mansa of Mali, like the Askia, and present-day marabouts, all had their heralds who audibly transmitted to the assembly the words of the chief."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_493_MlSong2] Court ceremony very similar throughout Black Africa: for example, covering the head with dust presented a sign of humility.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_494_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Written language was the culture of an urban élite, that did not absorb surrounding cultures and languages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_495_MlSong2] The development of the bureaucracy was thus linked to arabic writing and the acceptance of Islamic religion. The oldest example of writing in West Africa is from a 1100 CE tomb inscription at Gao.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_496_MlSong2] "Islam provided the kind of laws that were useful to bigger states and larger market-towns. Such laws were about the administration of justice, the inheritance of property, the improvement of market organization".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_497_MlSong2] Thus in the Western Sudan "the customs of Islam helped towards the formation of regular civil services staffed by 'king's men': by officials, that is, who owed their appointments not to their birth but to individual skill and service to the king."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_498_MlSong2] In addition to Islam, the literate bureaucracy also was long encouraged by merchant habits. "The customs activities of the border areas, based on what we have just said, would presuppose some kind of precise accounting, just as the payment of taxes and other fees would seem to imply the issuing of receipts, especially to the peripatetic merchants at the markets of Timbuktu, Djenne, etc."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_499_MlSong2] Given the wealth possessed by merchants perhaps it is noteworthy that: "Appointments to the various offices, in the traditional kingdoms, entailed the payment of a customary fee, not, however, necessarily to the king. ... Later on, with the profanation of the royal office, its secularization, this fee would return to the king. Thus, in Songhai, at the time of the conflict with Morocco, a Fondoko upon appointment was required to turn over two thousand cows."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_500_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The extent of the government developed by Songhai Askias can be appreciated in the fact there were more civil chiefs than military ones[MAJIDBENAM_REF_501_MlSong2] and that Askia Muhammad was "absent on a pilgrimage to Mecca for more than two years (1494-97) without causing himself any trouble at home."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_502_MlSong2] Officials included a finance officer (katisi-farma)and sub-officials responsible for wages, property and expenditure; and a minister of justice (asari-mundia).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_503_MlSong2] Other offices at various levels of government included: Guimi-koi or Gumei-koi "port director"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_504_MlSong2]; Hi-koi "responsible for ships and smaller craft"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_505_MlSong2]; Yobu-koi "in charge of the market"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_506_MlSong2]; assara-mundio "kind of police commissioner" found in Djenne and Timbuktu[MAJIDBENAM_REF_507_MlSong2]. Sources reported that Askia Ishaq I employed a tax collection agent[MAJIDBENAM_REF_508_MlSong2] and Askia Mohammed had a secretary who could draw up written documents.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_509_MlSong2] Letter writing was common means of communication[MAJIDBENAM_REF_510_MlSong2], hence: "Un important service de courrier relie la cour aux différentes villes et chef-lieux assurant la transmission des ordres de l'Askia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_511_MlSong2] The state had prisons at Kanato, Kabara (near Timbuktu) and elsewhere[MAJIDBENAM_REF_512_MlSong2] where there was widespread use of "notarized documents" such as for an inventory of goods belonging to a prison inmate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_513_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Prestige of state-level bureaucracy ♣ equal ♥</b>The bureaucracy was closely linked to the court and under the Songhai Askias became very well developed.

Elsewhere, it was no more than a thin veneer over the older beliefs and never managed to take deep root. In urban areas, Islam gave rise to a literate elite which, by its great creative efforts, lent lustre to Islam and contributed to its reinterpretation. This development was made possible by the general prosperity of the Sudan, which attracted many foreign scholars from the fifteenth century onwards, and, above all, by the benevolent policy of the sovereigns of Gao, such as the founder of the dynasty of the Askiyas, who heaped honours and gifts on the Muslim men of learning and bestowed on them a social prestige without parallel in the country. Askiya Muhammad I practised a systematically Muslim policy and worked for the introduction and extension of Islam in the Sudan. "Nevertheless, Islam was not the dominant religion in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The great mass of the Songhay and the peoples of the empire living in the countryside remained attached to their ancestral beliefs. Askiya Muhammad I, in a letter to al-Maghili, deplored and resisted this situation, although he was unable to change it. "The Songhay worshipped <i>hole</i> and spirits inhabiting nature, who had to be propitiated. Their pantheon included several divinities, among whom were Harke Dikko, the god of the Niger ('Isa Ber), and Dongo, the thunder god. Their magical healers, the sonianke, who were considered to be descendants of the fallen dynasty of the Sunni, enjoyed popular veneration and protected society from evil spirits and sorcerers or tierkei. The cult of the dead was perpetuated by each clan chief. Traditional religion, so strongly alive in the countryside, thus served to ensure the protection, the psychic equilibrium and the continuity of society. "Islam, when added on to these beliefs, made little or no impact on the countryside. Although it was urban and aristocratic, it eventually became better adapted for widespread acceptance. This was a black and tolerant form of Islam; it gained ground through the activities of Askiya Muhammad I and the Muslim doctors and through the peaceful expansion of trade, with which it was intimately linked from its very beginnings in black Africa. Askiya Muhammad I followed the advice of the great doctors, al-Maghili of Tuat and al-Suyuti from Cairo; with a glittering constellation of marabouts from his own empire he attacked the fetishes, hunted down the companions of Sunni, the 'bad Muslims', imposed a kadi and the Malikite law on a number of communities and waged a djihad (holy war) against the Mossi infidels. The itinerant traders and merchants did the rest and took the religion with them right into the heart of the southern forest regions. "Thus, at the end of the sixteenth century, Islam was dominant throughout the middle Niger from Macina to Dendi, and elsewhere had made considerable advances. Religious life can be understood best by looking at the towns. Jenne and Dia in the central delta, Gao and Timbuktu had their mosques, imams, kadis and cemeteries as well as many schools run by men of great piety and saints who are still venerated today in the Niger Bend. Timbuktu was a model city. It was known as the holy town of the Sudan by reason of its three great mosques - the Jingereber, the Sidi Yahya and the Sankore, the last two built in the first half of the fifteenth century - and the reputation of its holy men and doctors (Sharif Sidi Yahya, who died in 1464, Kadi Mahmud b. 'Umar Akit, who died in 1548, and many members of his family, including Kadi zl-Akib, who restored the great mosques). Its university spread Islamic culture throughout the western Sudan."

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Quranic Eve (unnamed in the Quran, but identified as Ḥawwaʿ in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Ṭabarī, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Quran explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Quran provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Quran and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain aḥadīth, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Quran and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna ʿAsharī (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mutʿah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Quranic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Muʾminūn) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Quran indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_795_MlSong2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Human Enforcement of Morality</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to care for the needy. "Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_796_MlSong2] "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_797_MlSong2] "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_798_MlSong2] "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_800_MlSong2] Moreover, justice is one of the key Islamic virtues: <i>In all their dealings, Muslims are required to stand firmly for justice even if it be against themselves or their kith and kin: 'O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)."

The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are.

If you are righteous, He surely was ever Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). [...](17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_805_MlSong2] In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void.

The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_807_MlSong2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft.

Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty.
