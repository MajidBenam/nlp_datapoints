foundational period for later social developments at Cahokia. At this time appears the first signs of warfare, an increase in social complexity and more widespread consumption of farmed crops like maize.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The increase in social complexity was reflected in settlements with houses clustered into court-yard groups.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_USMisSp] While there is little evidence for warfare in the preceding Middle Woodland[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_USMisSp] from c800 CE there is evidence of inter-group violence as human bones have been recovered with arrow points embedded into them in individual and group burials.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_USMisSp] Some settlements even gained palisades and ditches[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_USMisSp], although at this time they were present at only a tiny fraction of all sites (0.5% between 800-950 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_USMisSp]). After 700-800 CE there was a dramatic intensification of food production, particularly of maize farming, which brought higher yields and enabled more food to be extracted from a smaller territory and would lead to population growth.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_USMisSp][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The evidence suggests communities experienced increased differentiation of social roles, with individuals dedicated to "community defense, organization of labor, and communal storage of maize in secure central places".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_USMisSp] The Upper Mississippi region was populated by a number of small communities. The population of largest settlement was probably in the region of 500 people - although this population was not resident at the site that later became Cahokia.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner; Kalin Bullman ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Peter Peregrine ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=USMisSp&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [100-200] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Quasi-polities of the American Bottom might cover 100-200 KM2.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [400-500] ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population of largest settlement probably in region of 500 people and this would be the quasi-polity size.

through time, but the basic ritual structure may have remained essentially the same from late prehistory into the Colonial period. Based on the above description, warfare rituals would have included the creation of sacred space; elite involvement and sponsorship of rituals, especially feasting; use of sacred paraphernalia and props such as horns and feathers of supernaturals, plants, crystals, pipes, paints, and consecrated vessels; emphasis on symbolism in food, behavior, and color; consumption of medicines, including the black drink and the war medicine, for ritual cleansing and purification; acquisition, display, and ritual manipulation of war trophies; and ritual performance, including dancing with raptor tails or wings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_USMisSp] The following provides some information as to the effects of the "black drink": "In addition to being a stimulant, the beverage also acts as a diuretic, causing increased perspiration. And the Indians sometimes used it as an emetic. On these occasions they would drink it in large quantities, and in a quarter to half an hour they would vomit. Sometimes they would hold their arms across their chests and expell [sic] the contents of their stomachs six or eight feet. The Timucuans would drink repeatedly, vomiting it up each time (fig. 56). [...] Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, exciting it at all levels. [...] It enables a person to have a more rapid and clearer flow of thought, makes him capable of more sustained intellectual effort, and sharpens his reaction. It also increases his capacity for muscular work and lessens fatigue. Moreover, some evidence suggests that large doses of caffeine speed up blood clotting. These effects are pronounced with doses of 0.5 to 1.0 grams--the equivalent of three to six cups of strong coffee. When consumed in large quantities, black drink could have delivered at least this much caffeine, and perhaps as much as 3.0 to 4.0 grams. These effects from large quantities of black drink could have been important and even decisive factors in activities such as the ballgame or warfare."
