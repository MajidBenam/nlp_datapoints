An instrument was to hand in the form of Theudelinde, a princess of the Bavarians, but related through her mother to the Lombard royal house.

There were limits to what she could achieve. Authari forbade the baptism of Lombards according to the Catholic baptism.

In ancient and modem times, and in many cultures and religions, adherents have travelled to venerate holy places, to visit tombs of holy persons or heroes, to seek counsel from oracles or cures. "Well over 1,000 centers of pilgrimage existed in France from the Gallo-Roman period to the end of the Middle Ages. [...]. "Pilgrimage was motivated by a variety of reasons. Besides being an act of piety and veneration, a pilgrimage might be undertaken for remission of sins or for purification and absolution and, from the 6th century at least, could be imposed as penance. Many went on pilgrimage seeking miracles and cures or to give thanks for divine assistance. Some went to shrines to die in the presence of relics. "Kings, queens, nobles, and high ecclesiastics have been recorded as pilgrims through the centuries, but shrines attracted untold numbers of ordinary folk, especially in times of calamity like plagues and civil unrest. For the ordinary pilgrim, a journey to a shrine within France had the advantages of requiring less cost and less time than the great international pilgrimages to the Holy Land, Rome, or Santiago de Compostela. "By the 12th century, pilgrims set out from their home parishes after receiving special blessings, and they wore clothing that identified them as pilgrims. Customary garb was a cloak, a low-crowned and broad-brimmed hat, a pouch (called a “scrip”), and a pilgrim’s staff. Pilgrims carried letters from ecclesiastical authorities to identify them officially for their protection, although their efficacy was not always certain. "Most pilgrimages were made on foot, but those wealthy enough could travel by horse. Walking barefoot was not common, although some penitents and pious pilgrims did so. [...]. Travel on roads was especially dangerous in some periods (the 7th to mid-11th centuries, in particular) due to civil unrest, invasions, and robbery. "Food and water could be brought from home if the pilgrimage was for only a few days, but if the pilgrim was away longer resources had to be found along the roads. During periods of civil unrest and invasions, this was not always easy, nor were accommodations always to be found. A system of hospices for pilgrims within France is not apparent before the late 11th century, when the Augustinians were active in establishing shelters, especially in inhospitable regions. [...]. "Pilgrims brought gifts and tokens with them to shrines. In keeping with the practice at pre-Christian healing centers in Gaul, pilgrims seeking a cure for an illness might bring to the saint’s shrine a representation of the afflicted part of the body, frequently crudely made of wood, wax, or metal. If Christian pilgrims were making their pilgrimage to thank the holy patron for a cure, they might also bring such a token as well as gifts (frequently money, gold, gems, or oil). Pilgrims to Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat who were freed from prison after praying to St. Léonard brought their chains to hang near the saint’s tomb. In addition to leaving offerings at shrines, pilgrims brought away objects in some way sanctified by relics. In some instances, these relics-by-association were thought to possess the power of the saint. [...]. Pilgrims also brought away badges to indicate they had been to shrines. These had images symbolic of the shrine visited, as the head of John the Baptist for Amiens, the Virgin for Rocamadour, Le Puy, and other Marian sanctuaries. "[...]. "Pilgrimage to shrines within France was well established in the Gallo-Roman and Merovingian periods."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_249_FrMervM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> Reasonable inference.

The service has its origins in the Last Supper of Jesus Christ, described in the three Synoptic Gospels. The term appears as early as the 4th century (St. Ambrose, missam facere). "The most basic division within the Mass is that between its first part, the Fore-Mass or Liturgy of the Word, and the sacrificial rite proper that follows. For the early church, these are called the Mass of the Catechumens and the Mass of the Faithful, since the Catechumens, those undergoing instruction before baptism, were dismissed before the onset of the sacred mysteries. The Fore-Mass consisted at first only of an initial greeting from the presiding priest or bishop, readings from Scripture, a discourse (homily or sermon) on the readings, and concluding prayers. This is obviously a service of instruction, altogether appropriate for Catechumens. There were three readings rather than the medieval two: an Old Testament reading, one from an Epistle or the Acts of the Apostles, and one from the Gospels. There were no chants until the late 4th century, when a psalm, the apparent ancestor of the medieval Gradual, came to be a regular feature of the Fore-Mass. Its verses were chanted by the lector and answered by a congregational refrain. A second psalm, the Alleluia psalm, came by the early 5th century to be sung in the church at Jerusalem after the Gradual psalm, as prelude to the Gospel; it was not taken up immediately in the West. "After the dismissal of the Catechumens, the eucharistic rite began with the 'prayers of the faithful.' Next, the elements of bread and wine were brought in, and the presiding priest said the eucharistic prayer over them. The medieval Latin version of the prayer is present already in the De sacramentis of St. Ambrose of Milan (d. 397). Present also in the 4th century was the chanting of the Sanctus and the Lord’s Prayer, which formed the high points of a dialogue between celebrant and faithful, sung in all probability to the same simple tones employed in the Middle Ages (see Levy). During the distribution of the eucharist, a communion psalm was sung, generally Psalm 33 (34), with its Verse 8 as congregational refrain: 'Taste and see that the Lord is sweet.'

The service has its origins in the Last Supper of Jesus Christ, described in the three Synoptic Gospels. The term appears as early as the 4th century (St. Ambrose, missam facere). "The most basic division within the Mass is that between its first part, the Fore-Mass or Liturgy of the Word, and the sacrificial rite proper that follows. For the early church, these are called the Mass of the Catechumens and the Mass of the Faithful, since the Catechumens, those undergoing instruction before baptism, were dismissed before the onset of the sacred mysteries. The Fore-Mass consisted at first only of an initial greeting from the presiding priest or bishop, readings from Scripture, a discourse (homily or sermon) on the readings, and concluding prayers. This is obviously a service of instruction, altogether appropriate for Catechumens. There were three readings rather than the medieval two: an Old Testament reading, one from an Epistle or the Acts of the Apostles, and one from the Gospels. There were no chants until the late 4th century, when a psalm, the apparent ancestor of the medieval Gradual, came to be a regular feature of the Fore-Mass. Its verses were chanted by the lector and answered by a congregational refrain. A second psalm, the Alleluia psalm, came by the early 5th century to be sung in the church at Jerusalem after the Gradual psalm, as prelude to the Gospel; it was not taken up immediately in the West. "After the dismissal of the Catechumens, the eucharistic rite began with the 'prayers of the faithful.' Next, the elements of bread and wine were brought in, and the presiding priest said the eucharistic prayer over them. The medieval Latin version of the prayer is present already in the De sacramentis of St. Ambrose of Milan (d. 397). Present also in the 4th century was the chanting of the Sanctus and the Lord’s Prayer, which formed the high points of a dialogue between celebrant and faithful, sung in all probability to the same simple tones employed in the Middle Ages (see Levy). During the distribution of the eucharist, a communion psalm was sung, generally Psalm 33 (34), with its Verse 8 as congregational refrain: 'Taste and see that the Lord is sweet.'

Because, from a Seshat perspective, they are extremely similar to one another in terms of variables, both shall be coded. At a future date, it might be good to choose one over the other, but this shouldn't make a significant difference. "Trial by combat as a judicial method of settling differences between men began in Europe in the Dark Ages. It is thought that Gundobald, King of Burgundy, was the first ruling prince to introduce it, in about 501 AD. Edward Gibbon explained the trial by combat thus: 'Both in civil and in criminal proceedings, the plaintiff, or accuser, the defendant, or even the witness, were exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs; and it was incumbent on them either to desert their cause or publicly to maintain their honour in the lists of battle.' "According to Gibbon, Gundobald justified the introduction of the trial by combat with the question: 'Is it not true that the event of national wars and private combats is directed by the judgement of God: and that his providence awards victory to the juster cause?' The belief that trial by combat will reveal a just settlement between the contending parties by the operation of God's will underpins the medieval faith in the practice. Force of arms provide an answer, unclouded by false witnesses or fabricated evidence. Gibbons continues, caustically: 'By such prevailing arguments, the absurd and cruel practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to some tribes of Germany, was propagated and established in all the monarchies of Europe, from Sicily to the Baltic.' "Gundobald's law allowed for a duel if the accused persisted in denying the offence under oath and the accuser insisted on proof by force of arms. This remained the essence of trial by combat wherever in Europe it formed part of the judicial process. "[...] Established, as we have seen, in Burgundy, trial by combat soon spread to the rest of France, taking root in the Frankish kingdom and elsewhere. "[...]"The judicial combat, whether in France, Italy or England, was, in essence, the same. It was a public event, sanctioned by the King, openly contested in front of officials, spectators and the monarch on a ground and under conditions that conferred no advantage to either side. The result of the contest was agreed by the parties to be binding. As such it could scarcely more different from the private, illegal and secret encounter that was the modern duel. [...] "As is the case with trial by combat and medieval jousting, the duel of chivalry has obvious claims to be regarded as a precursor of the modern duel. In particular, it existed for the settling of questions touching upon the honour of a knight or a noble. In this respect it is the direct antecedent of the modern duel. However, as with trial by combat, it is distinguished from the modern duel by the fact that it was fight conducted in public with the authority and blessing of the monarch. "As trial by combat developed, so the custom of the parties' employing a champion emerged. A champion was a hired man who fought the trial on his principal's behalf. Although it enabled the principal to avoid the tiresome and dangerous obligation to fight his opponent in the lists, it did not absolve him from the consequences of the result. As one historian puts it, 'As for the principals in a capital fight by proxy, they were kept out of sight of the duel, with a rope round their necks, and the one who was beaten by proxy was immediately hanged in person.'"

For a theorist of royal power like Jonas of Orléans (c.780-842/43), the task of the king was “to govern the people of God,” a term that now referred, not to a group who have been called by God out of a larger social whole (1 Peter 2:9-10; Revelation 8:14), but simply to the people of Europe (The Institution of the King §4, in O’Donovan and O’Donovan, 1999: 218).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_410_FrMervM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers control supernatural energy ♣ absent ♥</b> "The kings of France and of England claimed that a simple touch of their hands, made according to the traditional rites, was able to cure the scrofulous. When did they begin to exercise this miraculous power? [...] Neither the Merovingians nor the Carolingians, as far as documentary evidence goes, possessed this special form of healing power for the specific illness of scrofula. But may they not have been considered capable of healing either some other particular disease, or even disease in general? [...] If Charlemagne or Louis the Pious had laid hands upon the sick, is it conceivable that the monk of St-Gall or the Astronomer would not have mentioned this miraculous feat? Is it likely that any of those writers at the royal court, who formed the brilliant constellation of the 'Carolingian renaissance', could fail to make some passing allusion to such a notable fact? No doubt--as I recalled above--there is an equal documentary silence from Louis IV to St-Louis; but later on I shall offer an explanation of this silence, which after all only lasted three reigns. [...] The incomparably much longer silence of Merovingian and Carolingian literature would be absolutely inexplicable on any other assumption than the absence of the very rite we are searching for, but in vain. There is no reason to believe that the descendants of Clovis or Pepin ever claimed to heal anyone in their capacity as king." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_411_FrMervM] "Scholars venturing beyond the practical function of the Merovingian royal hairstyle as a symbol of kingship and a marker of social distinction, have frequently invoked the idea that the Franks perceived royal long hair as ‘magical’- yet how they wielded this magic and where it originated from is mostly left unexplained. The early emergence of the reges criniti in the Frankish sources would imply a non-Christian origin of this powerful symbol, as it pre-dates the conversion of the Franks to Christianity. Yet it need not necessarily mean that the Franks continued to perceive long hair in a pagan capacity after their conversion. In fact, there is no evidence whatsoever that Merovingian kings from the sixth century onwards maintained pagan customs; they appear to have acted in all things Christian."

For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the rst was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage. It was tantamount to downing a beer and a sandwich and calling that the eucharist, or diving into a pond several times and calling that baptism writ large. This simply could not be. It was not only a “legal impossibility,” as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too.

Christianity inherited from the OT a healthy message of concern for widows, orphans, and strangers (e.g. Deut. 24: 17-21), along with prophetic opposition to those who used their wealth and power to oppress the economically and socially weak. The very early post‐NT codes on which we have already drawn maintained the Jewish moral message by attributing to ‘the way of death’ the actions of those who ‘attend not to the widow and orphan’, ‘turn away the needy’, and ‘oppress the afflicted’ (Epistle of Barnabas, 20. 2; see Didache, 5. 2). The denunciation bears on sins of omission (failures to help widows and orphans) and those of commission (in positively turning away the needy and oppressing those who are already afflicted).// Those whom Jesus expected his followers to help included the hungry, the thirsty, strangers, the naked, the sick, and prisoners (Matt. 25: 31-46). The list of the suffering with whom he identified did not explicitly include widows and orphans, but the list was obviously open‐ended. His parable of ‘the Good Samaritan’ powerfully illustrates what he wants from all: the willingness to reach across religious and cultural divides to help any human being in distress (Luke 10: 30-7). He left no room for a self‐absorption that may not even notice the pain of others. [...] This moral message provided an important stimulus for the development of hospitals. St Basil of Caesarea (d. 379) founded what was perhaps the first Christian hospital. Innumerable doctors, nurses, and administrators have followed his lead, not least Catholic women who belonged to religious institutes founded specifically to care for the sick and the terminally ill. They have ‘come to the help’ of the sick as enjoined by Jesus' message (Matt. 25: 36). Many others have realized that one should add to the list in Matthew's text those who are ignorant and in need of education. Part at least of the astonishing commitment by Catholics and other Christians to the work of educating children and older persons has been fired by the sense of Jesus saying to them: ‘I was ignorant and you taught me.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_446_FrMervM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> "Jacques Le Maho, for example, has mined episcopal <i>vitae</i> for the diocese of Rouen from the sixth to the ninth centuries and concludes that Merovingian bishops, as they toured their dioceses, established hospices along public roads, particularly along their diocesan frontiers, in order to welcome new visitors."

The sixth-century collection of sermons known as the Eusebius Gallicanus collection illustrates the importance of penance in preaching in Gaul at this period. Julianus Pomerius’s pupil Caesarius, bishop of Arles in the first half of the sixth century, followed the advice of his teacher and unceasingly preached to his congregation that they should abandon the road of evil, bewail their sins and do penance for them. He presented himself to his flock as the Old Testament prophet Isaiah, who on the Lord’s command had to ‘cry out unceasingly and lift his voice like a trumpet blast to announce their sins to the people’ (Ezekiel 3.18). Caesarius distinguished between daily or lesser sins and deadly sins (peccata minuta, peccata quotidiana and peccata capitalia). Among the first he reckons eating or drinking to excess, talking too loud when one should be silent or remaining silent when one should speak aloud, harsh treatment of beggars, non-observance of fasting periods, tardiness in rising for church, sexual relations for other reasons than for procreation, failing to visit the sick and the imprisoned, failure to reconcile enemies when there is an opportunity to do so, harshness with one’s family and servants, flattery of the powerful, idle talk in church, evil thoughts, a lascivious gaze (concupiscentia oculorum) and listening to obscene tales and songs. The capital sins include murder, adultery and honoring pagan cults (sacrilegium), as well as false testimony, theft, pride, envy, avarice, anger, frequent abuse of alcohol, fornication and abortion. For such grave sins, serious remedies were in order. Caesarius mentions tears, bewailment, long fasts, generous alms, removal from the Eucharist and the ritual of public penance as means to make up for the sins. Without these the sinner would be condemned to eternal damnation, Caesarius preached. The penitent was also supposed to shave his hair and to wear special clothing, but, Caesarius admonished, it was even more important to change his behaviour and to stop sinning.

Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_492_FrMervM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Late antique and early medieval sermons to the laity often stressed the sinful nature of man and the necessity to make satisfaction for one’s sins.

The sixth-century collection of sermons known as the Eusebius Gallicanus collection illustrates the importance of penance in preaching in Gaul at this period.

He presented himself to his flock as the Old Testament prophet Isaiah, who on the Lord’s command had to ‘cry out unceasingly and lift his voice like a trumpet blast to announce their sins to the people’ (Ezekiel 3.18). Caesarius distinguished between daily or lesser sins and deadly sins (peccata minuta, peccata quotidiana and peccata capitalia). Among the first he reckons eating or drinking to excess, talking too loud when one should be silent or remaining silent when one should speak aloud, harsh treatment of beggars, non-observance of fasting periods, tardiness in rising for church, sexual relations for other reasons than for procreation, failing to visit the sick and the imprisoned, failure to reconcile enemies when there is an opportunity to do so, harshness with one’s family and servants, flattery of the powerful, idle talk in church, evil thoughts, a lascivious gaze (concupiscentia oculorum) and listening to obscene tales and songs.
