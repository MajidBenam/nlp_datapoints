Both indigenous and Indo-European languages existed side by side on that plateau from earliest times. <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣  ♥</b>The Early Bronze Age period in Anatolia is complicated and complex topic. This period begins with controversy, because the transition from Late Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age is not clear. Some scholars argue that beginning of Early Bronze age should be dated to around 3000 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>This is clearly visible at the monumental graves, known as Royal Tombs at Alaca Höyük site. These tombs yielded over 700 items that we can grouped into 12 typological categories. A multiplicity of materials were used in those grave goods - from metals (copper, bronze, silver, gold, electrum, iron, lead, haematite), stones (carnelian, rock crystal, chalcedony, flint, lapis lazuli), frit, faience, pottery, to bone and textiles. The most spectacular findings were anthropomorphic figurines, which were made by the combination more than one metal in a single object. In these Royal Tombs we can find also remains of ceremonial funerary feasts. Some animals were slaughtered, the oxen being the most common.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Many sites of this period were well fortified. Proof of wooden palisades and stone walls was found in Karataş-Semayük, and just stone walls in for example Taurus and Demircihöyük. At Alişar Hüyük, complex fortifications were excavated - a well constructed stronghold wall, and 10 meters of fortification on the terrace. One of these walls was set behind the other, and onto it rectangular-shaped bastions were constructed. A lot of handheld weapons were also found in Central Anatolia Plateau, for example: swords, daggers, pikes, halberds, spears, battle axes and warclubs. At the Demircihöyük and Karataş-Semayük sites, there were extramural Early Bronze Age cemeteries - altogether there were about 900 pithoi burials, and the majority of bodies was facing Southeast.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pottery of Anatolian Early Bronze Age was distinctive by red monochrome wares. In terms of animal remains, it can be concluded that Sheep and goats were most dominant (at Acemhöyük), representing 63-68 percent of the faunal remains, followed by cattle and pigs.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Wood or rather wooden planks were used in Royal Tombs at Alaca Höyük.

Even if the ore mined in antiquity were low grade, containing only 1&nbsp;% of tin like some the nodules found in the excavations, the size of the galleries point to the produciotn of some 115 tons of tin." <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Iron present E.g. grave goods  <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>.

A lot of handheld weapons were also found in Central Anatolia Plateau, for example: swords, daggers, pikes, halberds, spears, battle axes and warclubs.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=TrBrzER&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Professions">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Occupational complexity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣  ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣  ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣  ♥</b>  unknown</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=TrBrzER&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: Bureaucracy characteristics">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣  ♥</b> unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Source of support ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Examination system ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Merit promotion ♣ inferred absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥</b> Megaron in Karataş - Semayük <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> A large, independent megaron structure was constructed on the highest point of the mound, overlooking the settlement.

M. Palmieri, Hauptmann, and Hess 1998; and see Muhly, chapter 39 in this volume). On the top of the cist were the bodies of four adolescents, who had probably been sacrificed: two of them, a girl and probably a boy, lay on the top of the tombstone, wearing copper pins and a diadem and hair spirals made of copper-silver alloy, similar to the items found among the grave goods buried with the “lord” in the cist, which may indicate kinship or some other kind of close linkage with him. Two other individuals, again very young and both female, were found outside the area of the cist, in the zone of the foot of the dead lord, with no burial goods, and may have been servants. The presence of this extraordinary burial, dated to 3000-2900 b.c.e., and the large fortification wall on the top of the mound, together with the disappearance of cult areas, cretulae, and mass-produced bowls, may indicate that a new type of power had been installed, focusing more on defense and on the political and military role of the chiefs rather than on their capacity to centralize resources and labor, as had been the case in the fourth millennium b.c.e.
