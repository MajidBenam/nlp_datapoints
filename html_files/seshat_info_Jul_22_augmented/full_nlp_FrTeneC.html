They could bear some traces of blows received in combat, but they remained usable and were above all objects of great value, such as those found in the graves of warriors or chiefs. The Gauls, like the Romans in their triumphs, selected the finest spoils. This is why neither arrows nor sling bullets - weapons of auxiliaries rather than warriors - are found in the sanctuaries. "These objects were carried into the sanctuaries with the greatest solemnity. A passage of Caesar suggests that all warriors together came to offer to the gods the spoils that each had taken. After the rites of consecration, about which we have no evidence, they were suspended on the walls of the sanctuary. And as the Greek word <i>anatithemi</i> suggests (originally 'suspend on the walls of the temple', later 'to consecrate'), this was the essence of the consecration. Weapons, together with human and cattle skulls, became untouchable offerings that remained suspended for decades, even centuries.

It is this specific type of hunt that will be coded here. "Arrian informs us that the Celts never hunted 'without the gods'. By that he meant that the hunt, like the war to which it was related , was a ritual activity that needed divine permission and assistance. "Arrian tells us that hunting was one of the Celts' favourite occupations and not simply a noble pastime. It was a daily level of skill and courage which involved many levels of society. The methods were diverse - on horseback, on foot, with dogs, or with nets. Among the Gauls, hunting became an art for which they remained famous throughout the Roman empire. "[...] "Religion was of course intimately linked with this occupation. To kill an animal had remained, since prehistoric times, a hazardous act that could not be carried out without the consent of the gods, or at least without the ritual precautions that took its place. "There are in effect three ways of putting an animal to death: the hunt, sacrifice, and butchery. The last was the rarest in antiquity. It was therefore in sanctuaries and at the hunt that animals were killed - domestic animals in the first case and wild ones in the second. There is no doubt that this method was the first form of sacrifice. It demanded the same ritual precautions: consent of the victim or the deity thought to represent it, and the reservation of part of the spoils for this same divinity. "The hunt also had a sporting character that was recognized by the peoples of antiquity. Thus the deity of the hunt was often linked with war; this was the case with Artemis in Greece, who was also <i>kourotrophos</i> (one who rears children); the initiation of youngsters was in fact done by means of exercises and hunting trials. In Gaul, where the cultivation of the body never attained the perfection that it knew in Greece, it is probable that the hunt mainly formed part of the apprenticeship of war. A youth had to confront nature and its savage denizens before being admitted into the society of men. "[...] "It is obvious from [a] passage [from Arrian] that the capture of game was regarded as a theft from nature, and one that had to be repaid. Its redemption was made according to a principle dear to the Celts and one that Caesar had already emphasized, that 'only a life can redeem a life'. Here it was domestic animals that were exchanged for wild ones."

However, the fact that it was a form of initiation [MAJIDBENAM_REF_261_FrTeneC] suggests that it only occurred once in one's lifetime, or that it occurred a number of times throughout a relatively short, post-pubescent phase of one's lifetime, which is effectively the same as "once in a lifetime".</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ substantial minority ♥</b> Warriors.

First, the importance of hierarchy at feasts: "Ceremonial did not only attach to the hearth, but extended more widely to social gatherings and general conviviality. Feasts accompanied by scrupulous ritual were its most elaborate manifestation. Posidonius gives the following account: '[...] When a large number dine together they sit around in a circle with the most influential man in the centre, like the leader of the chorus, whether he surpasses the others in warlike skills, or lineage, or wealth. Beside him sits the host and next on either side the others in order of distinction [...]." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_343_FrTeneC] Second, the prestige that the elites enjoyed in the all-important realm of war: "A noble was first and foremost one who possessed a mount and the complete panoply of a combatant: a sword in its scabbard, a shield and spears. [...] As warriors they had the greatest privileges, and they alone could take command in war. Commoners could only serve as infantry, and in the army clients were companions-in-arms of their lord." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_344_FrTeneC] This last point is particularly significant when considering the importance of bravery in Gallic ideology: "To fight was a duty and an honour; it was one way of doubly affirming a man's status as an adult and citizen." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_345_FrTeneC] Third: "The Celts did not have castes or anything that resembled them. Instead, it was lineage that counted for most and lent weight to the powerful. Kinship founded nobility, which was not so much a hereditary right as an inheritance painstakingly assembled by the ancestors." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_346_FrTeneC] However, no evidence of actual enforcement of respect for authority could be found. And even if respect for authority was enforced--which does seem likely--it's not obvious that this would have constituted enforcement of morality, as opposed to, for example, law enforcement, or, indeed, simple enforcement of the hierarchical order, with no connection to morality proper.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "To fight was a duty and an honour; it was one way of doubly affirming a man's status as an adult and citizen."

[...] In the late La Tène there is no cemetery evidence at all in what was once the West Hallstatt area except for a very localized phenomenon in the Wetterau north of Frankfurt, best represented by the late La Tène burials of Wederath. The overall impression is of a society that did not express status differences primarily by means of grave wealth (Haffner 1989: 52)."

It is dominated again by burial evidence, cemeteries of inhumations, or occasionally by cremations with no sign of a tumulus. The men are buried with their weap- ons—usually a spear, more rarely a shield and sword. The women have their jewellery—bronze anklets, bracelets, brooches and torcs. Gold is rare and confined to small items such as finger- rings. Except in peripheral areas, such as northern Italy, the Balkans or north-western France, burials with vehicles, exotic imports or large gold objects are unknown. The gravegoods suggest that this is a ‘ranked’ society, with higher status indicated by complete sets of weapons or jewellery, while many graves contain only one or two items, or nothing at all."

The problem is whether there was a genuine change in the social order with the disappearance of trade in La Tène B, or merely a change in burial rite with wealth not symbolised in the funerary rite, so imported luxuries do not appear in the archaeological record. The latest rich burial is the woman from Waldalgesheim, with wagon, goldtorc, bracelets, armlet and an Italian bucket. There is no other rich burial in the area until late in La Tène C; by La Tène D rich burials are back again with imported Italian bronze vessels after a gap of over 300 years."

These fibulae pairs were used for fastening garments at the shoulder, while a third fibula was usually found on the chest. The right to wear a torc was apparently linked to social rank or status within the family.

This could reflect the eradication of a complete family-unit  as the result —perhaps— of an epidemic, but it could also represent the practice, recorded by Caesar, of the killing of ‘favourites’ alongside the deceased head of the family which, so he comments, only became obsolete  a  short  time  before  his  arrival  in Gaul in 58 BC. A curious funerary  practice  noted  in  Iron Age Ireland (Raftery 1994, 199) may be the result of some kind of retainer-sacrifice: the bodies  of  children, aged  between  five and nine years, quite frequently accompany those of adults; the majority of the children buried in the cemetery at Carrowjames, Co. Mayo were associated  with  the  bodies  of  fully-grown individuals. One possible explanation for  this  pattern  of  interment  is  the  human sacrifice of juvenile ‘retainers’, either as helpmeets in the  afterlife or in the expectation that  the  family  would  continue to exist together across the  liminal zone of death. Recent excavations at Folly Lane, St Albans (Niblett  1992, 917-929) have revealed the presence of a complex funerary ritual associated  with  the lying-in-state  and cremation  of a  high-ranking  Catuvellaunian, who died in about AD 55. The grave was in the centre  of a ritual enclosure and, in the ditch near  the  entrance,  three inhumations were laid, without grave-goods, on the unsilted ditch-floor. Definitive publication of the site is still awaited, but it is perhaps permissible to suggest that the bodies in the ditch —  if  contemporary  with  the  central cremation — might be present as the result of retainer-sacrifice.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_368_FrTeneC] <span style="color:blue">not within NGA boundaries</span></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency of retainer burials ♣ ♥</b> unknown,
