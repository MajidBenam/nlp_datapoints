The Dominate was split into two distinct administrative halves: a Western half with its capital at Rome and an Eastern one, ruled first from Nicomedia in Anatolia and then from Byzantium (re-founded as Constantinople, modern-day Istanbul, by the Emperor Constantine I the Great in 330 CE). Each half was ruled by a different emperor along with a junior colleague, titled 'Caesar'. This arrangement is known as the Tetrarchy ('rule of four'), which lasted until Constantine I managed to once again rule both halves together. The Empire was divided a few more times, until Theodosius (r. 379-392 CE) united it for the final time. In 393, Theodosius once more divided the Empire, naming Arcadius emperor in the east and Honorius emperor in the west. This marks the end of the Dominate period, leading to a period of instability and, ultimately, the collapse of the Roman state in the west, yet recovery and the continuation of Roman rule in the east (which became known as the Byzantine Empire, after Constantinople's original name).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Beginning with Honorius, the Western Empire experienced a continuous decline and a series of invasions at the hands of Germanic, Vandal, Alan, and Hun forces throughout the 5th century. In 476 CE, a Roman military officer of likely Germanic decent (though his exact ancestry is not certain) named Odoacer led a revolt against the western emperor Romulus Augustus (r. 475-476 CE), a child whose rule was overseen by his father, a high-ranking general named Orestes. Odoacer and his fellow soldiers killed Orestes and effectively deposed Romulus Augustus, and Odoacer's authority was recognized by the Eastern Roman emperor at the time, Zeno, although he was not proclaimed Emperor in the West. In 480 CE, after the death of Julius Nepos, whom Zeno recognized as the legitimate Western Emperor, Zeno abolished the co-emperorship, claiming to rule over both halves of the Empire, although much of the Western Empire had already been lost and Italy itself remained under the control of Odoacer, who ruled as king.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Western Roman Emperor in principle maintained a formal alliance with the Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, which meant that all legislation generated in one half of the Empire was to be communicated to the other half and promulgated across the entire Empire.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> In practice, the Western Roman Emperor was the slightly weaker party whose position depended on the acquiescence of the Eastern Empire; for instance, the term of the Western Emperor Valentinian III (r. 423-455 CE) required the agreement of the Eastern Emperor Theodosius II.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Further, significant differences between the 'twin Empires' - the language of Latin in Rome, Greek in Constantinople - always strained the commitment to unity.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Western Emperor did not control the army.

"The fifth century was in general a peaceful period for Rome’s eastern frontier. On just two occasions was this peace disturbed, and only one of these involved significant campaigning. [...] The first war broke out in 420, as a result of the refusal of Theodosius II to return to the Persians the Christians who had sought refuge from persecution in his empire. In addition, the Persians had proved unwilling to return to the Romans gold-miners who had been working in Persian territory; they had also despoiled Roman merchants of their goods. Consequently the Emperor despatched Ardaburius, a magister militum praesentalis, to the East, where he conducted an invasion of Arzanene by way of Armenia. Having defeated the Persian commander Mihr-Narseh, he foiled his opponent’s attempt to ravage Mesopotamia, and laid siege to the enemy at Nisibis.//"The conflict then escalated as Theodosius transferred further troops to the East, while the new Persian king Bahram V (420-439) took the field himself, supported by a large contingent of Saracen allies. He drove the Romans from Nisibis, but the Saracens were less successful in their attempt to take Antioch: they suddenly took fright, we are told, and many were drowned in the Euphrates. Presumably they were defeated as they manoeuvred to the southwest of the main Roman army in their march against Antioch. Another battle ensued between the two main armies, in which Areobindus inflicted a heavy defeat on the Persians; it was almost certainly in this engagement that he distinguished himself by defeating the Persian Ardazanes in single combat. Peace negotations then ensued, although terms were not settled until the Persian Immortals had suffered a crushing defeat through the timely arrival of the recently appointed magister militum per Orientem Procopius.//"The story of the 440 war can be told more swiftly, since there were no major engagements between the two sides, and the Romans hastened to come to terms: [...] The Persians invaded in 440, apparently causing some damage in Armenia, but withdrew after the magister militum per Orientem Anatolius had bought them off."<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Wars of world religion against tribal religion ♣ present ♥</b> E.g.

Chariot races are coded here as the Circus Maximus could seat many more people than other arenas. The public celebrations of 519 CE were particularly spectacular, as they included triumphal processions and the display of a large number of exotic animals. Because these spectacles were obviously inspired by the kinds of spectacles that had been popular in preceding centuries, it makes sense to quote, here and in the variables below, descriptions of these spectacles as they had occurred in the later Roman Empire. Regarding chariot races <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> "The Circus Maximus was by far the largest stadium in Rome. It was a third of a mile long and could seat potentially up to 350,000 spectators. Unlike the Flavian Amphitheater, whose 55,000 seats would have been largely occupied by the upper classes, the size of the Circus Maximus meant that all segments of Roman society could attend races. Admission was free or for a nominal fee. In addition, chariot races were held frequently. Whereas there might have been only two or three gladiator contests per year, each of the over 100 holidays per year would have included chariot racing. All these factors ensured that chariot racing was the most popular form of entertainment for the average inhabitant of the city as well as the most accessible. "[A] race could have a maximum of 12 chariots. [...] The total length of a standard race was about eight kilometers and probably took less than 15 minutes to complete. [...] There were 24 races per day; thus, one could spend an entire day at the Circus Maximus. The winning charioteer received a crown of palm leaves and the winner's prize money. These prizes seem to have ranged between 5,000 and 60,000 sesterces for first place, and there were also lesser prizes for second, third, and fourth place. [...] They developed elaborate cheers and songs that tens of thousands of fans would chant and sing in unison. Often these chants deteriorated into abuse directed at the fans of other factions, and riots were not infrequent. [...] Many charioteers died not directly as the result of a crash but from being dragged around the track after one.

the people of Rome, involving chariot races, theatrical performances (including pantomimes), and hunting shows or <i>venationes</i> <sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup>. Chariot races are coded here as the Circus Maximus could seat many more people than other arenas. The public celebrations of 519 CE were particularly spectacular, as they included triumphal processions and the display of a large number of exotic animals. Because these spectacles were obviously inspired by the kinds of spectacles that had been popular in preceding centuries, it makes sense to quote, here and in the variables below, descriptions of these spectacles as they had occurred in the later Roman Empire. Regarding chariot races <sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup> "The Circus Maximus was by far the largest stadium in Rome. It was a third of a mile long and could seat potentially up to 350,000 spectators. Unlike the Flavian Amphitheater, whose 55,000 seats would have been largely occupied by the upper classes, the size of the Circus Maximus meant that all segments of Roman society could attend races. Admission was free or for a nominal fee. In addition, chariot races were held frequently. Whereas there might have been only two or three gladiator contests per year, each of the over 100 holidays per year would have included chariot racing. All these factors ensured that chariot racing was the most popular form of entertainment for the average inhabitant of the city as well as the most accessible. "[A] race could have a maximum of 12 chariots. [...] The total length of a standard race was about eight kilometers and probably took less than 15 minutes to complete. [...] There were 24 races per day; thus, one could spend an entire day at the Circus Maximus. The winning charioteer received a crown of palm leaves and the winner's prize money. These prizes seem to have ranged between 5,000 and 60,000 sesterces for first place, and there were also lesser prizes for second, third, and fourth place. [...] They developed elaborate cheers and songs that tens of thousands of fans would chant and sing in unison. Often these chants deteriorated into abuse directed at the fans of other factions, and riots were not infrequent. [...] Many charioteers died not directly as the result of a crash but from being dragged around the track after one. This happened because charioteers habitually tied the reins to their arms."</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not specified by sources</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not specified by sources</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not specified by sources</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not specified by sources</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ 350,000 ♥</b> Colosseum: 55,000; Circus Maximus: 350,000 <sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not specified by sources</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (participants) ♣ substantial minority ♥</b> "Ludi were events for the city as a whole, open not just to Roman Citizens, but to foreigners and slaves." <sup id="cite_ref-196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup> This is including spectators.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (audience) ♣ whole polity ♥</b> "Ludi were events for the city as a whole, open not just to Roman Citizens, but to foreigners and slaves." <sup id="cite_ref-197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup> This is including spectators.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Dysphoric elements</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fasting ♣ absent ♥</b> Not recorded for this ritual <sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ vigil/sleep deprivation ♣ absent ♥</b> Not recorded for this ritual <sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fear ♣ absent ♥</b> Not recorded for this ritual <sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ humiliation ♣ absent ♥</b> Not recorded for this ritual <sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ disgust ♣ absent ♥</b> Not recorded for this ritual, though <sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup>, though Theodoric himself condemned the games as a “detestable act,” “unhappy contest,” “cruel game,” “bloodthirsty delight,” and “human savagery,” and suggest[ed] that if there were any justice in the world, “as much wealth would be given for the life of these living men as seems to be showered for their death.” <sup id="cite_ref-203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-203">[203]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ poisoning/dysphoria-causing drugs ♣ absent ♥</b> Not recorded for this ritual <sup id="cite_ref-204" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-204">[204]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ pain ♣ present ♥</b> For chariot racing: inferred from the fact that the "stadium seems to have been designed to maximize carnage" and that riots among spectators were common <sup id="cite_ref-205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup>.

Children of the senatorial class, as well as of wealthy and ambitious other families, did not attend primary schools, but continued to study with private teachers (i.e., their families' own slaves or paid instructors) (Booth 1979b). Thus, Pliny the Elder designates a boy attending a (public) school as poor (Plin. Nat. 9. 8. 25). The style of one's education, then, was socially determined. A thorough (private) education on the primary level continued to be connected to wealth and social status. The consequences of such practices, that is to say, the quality (literacy, semi‐literacy) and quantification of literacy in the late republic and the principate are still matters of debate. Apart from the social strata concerned, modern estimates of the overall population's literacy quota vary between 5% and 20%, with great differences regarding periods, cities, regions, and individual provinces. [...] But what of the children who were not even free‐born? The rearing of slaves was likewise based on the concept of forming a particular kind of individual, but had significantly other aims in this, and thus a significantly different educational concept: not to bring out the best, to anchor virtues and values in the mind by education and the teaching of letters, literature, and the cultural memory of the Romans, but rather, ‘training.’ Young slaves were manipulated, trained, and taught like whelps or colts (Plut. Cato 21. 1). The fostering of ‘homeborn’ slave children (vernae) was useful for the master's own requirements in the household (e.g., Nep. Atticus 13. 3; Plut. Cato 21. 7; Plut. Crassus 2. 6), and it was quite literally an economic investment, since trained slaves—for example, as singers, hairdressers, financial administrators, private secretaries, or teachers of Greek language and literature—could be sold at a higher price than they had been worth before such training. Accordingly, some slave children received a primary education either at home, if they were owned by wealthy families in which private education was common, or with teachers in the local community (Booth 1979a)."<sup id="cite_ref-377" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-377">[377]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all social classes ♣ yes ♥</b> Enslaved people could, in theory, own property, or so this quote seems to suggest: "Basically, discipline comprised two components: a carrot and a stick (Bradley 1984).

The Greeks and Romans were monogamous—men married and created children through one legitimate wife. They valued marriage and marital harmony, but the striking fact is that only one surviving author of the Roman empire, Musonius Rufus, made an unambiguously (p. 681) strong case for sexually exclusive marriage. Plutarch, in his Advice to the Bride and Groom, ultimately urged women to bear a husband’s escapades lightly. The Roman model of marriage simply did not demand sexual exclusivity from men. To call it a double standard is to trivialize the problem. The Greeks and Romans operated with a dual standard, two patently different sets of expectations in sexual behavior. This pattern was rooted in social structure. Female chastity was enforced in the name of ensuring patrimonial legitimacy. While men were viciously punished for violating free women, they were permitted to use dishonored women—prostitutes, concubines, and slaves—as sexual partners. Public law reinforced the system by protecting the sexual honor of respectable women and exposing dishonored women to the remainder of male desire. Salvian complained that Roman policy amounted to “forbidding adulteries, building brothels.” The average age at marriage strengthened the dual standard, with men entering marriage nearly a decade after sexual maturity.

This made it possible for Christian bishops to convene in councils and to issue their decisions. Penance is often found as a prerequisite for returning to the Christian congregation after having committed a serious fault. The council of Ancyra for example, which convened in 314, ruled that men having had sexual relations with animals should live as supplicants for fifteen years, after which they were allowed to take part in prayer in church; after another five years they were allowed to take part in ‘simple communion’ and if they persevered they were finally allowed to participate again in communion with offerings. This canon illustrates a process by which sinners were only gradually readmitted as full members of the Christian community. During a period of fifteen years they were apparently not entitled to attend Mass, and only five years later were they readmitted to the Eucharist, but evidently still with reservations since their offerings were not accepted until after a certain lapse of time. These rules, as issued by bodies invested with ecclesiastical authority, implied a certain form of control and discipline to make certain that they were carried out in a proper way. Councils acted as legislative bodies to issue general rulings on disciplinary matters and to determine the period of penance for a specific offence. Somebody however had to oversee the process of assigning such disciplinary measures, to keep an eye on the proper behaviour of the excommunicated person and on the process by which he was to be readmitted into the community. The actual assignment of a period of exclusion, according to the rulings issued by councils from the fifth and sixth centuries, was in principle the task of the local bishop. [...] The church historian Sozomenos described the ritual of penance as he had seen it in Rome, and from his description it is clear that in Rome as in Hippo penitents were assigned a special place in the church. At the end of Mass the penitents threw themselves on the floor and the bishop joined them with tears in his eyes. He then stood up and the penitents followed suit. It seems that Sozomenos is describing the act of entrance into a penitential state here, for he goes on to explain that the penitents were obliged to fulfil penitential exercises such as fasting for as long as the bishop had decided, and then were acquitted of their sin and allowed to take part fully in the liturgical practices of the community again." <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Type of punishment this typically entailed (can be more than one):</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b> "Although late antique church council canons put great effort on writing up suggestions for bishops on the length of penance to be imposed for particular misdeeds, early Christian texts were remarkably unforthcoming on the details of activities a penitent was to undertake during this period.

A great number of citizens of Thessalonica had been killed by Gothic troops as a reprisal for the murder of their general Butherich. Although the penance assigned to the emperor has often been depicted as a show of force on the part of the Christian bishop, it is now conceived as a carefully balanced act between bishop and emperor to redeem Theodosius of the sin and of the political blame he had contracted. In Ambrose’s view Theodosius, as a baptized Christian, could not partake of the Eucharist with blood on his hands. Ambrose did his utmost to arrange for a public penance of the emperor, thereby strengthening the political position of his imperial friend. [...] As Ambrose had expressed it in a sermon delivered during another contest with an emperor, the emperor was a member of the Church and not someone who was above it (<i>intra ecclesiam, non supra ecclesiam</i>). As a member of the Church, a baptized emperor such as Theodosius - which at that time was still something of a novelty - should live according to the strict rules of the Christian faith. The guilt that he had incurred because of the massacre was well known to all Christians and put the bishop in a difficult position. Ambrose could not ignore the emperor’s sin, but could he deal with this sinner as he would have done with others? Probably not, although it has been observed that we lack specific knowledge about the ordinary ways of dealing with sinners in Milan in this period. Ambrose could point to biblical precedents of kings doing penance, most of all, of course, the case of David doing penance for his adultery with Bathsheba and his responsibility for the killing of her husband Uriah. Ambrose’s arguments might have helped to convince Theodosius that penance could also bring honour, but probably Ambrose also showed him the way out of a precarious political situation, as Neil McLynn has argued. In November the emperor declared that he was willing to undergo public penance. In the address delivered by Ambrose on the death of the penitent emperor five years later, the bishop reminded his audience how the emperor laid down all the imperial insignia, bewailed his sin in public in the basilica and implored absolution with tears and laments. He stressed that the emperor was not ashamed to do what the citizens were ashamed of: to do penance in public." <sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ punishment of elites ♣ present ♥</b> "From Jerome’s letter to Oceanus we learn that the Roman matrona Fabiola entered the order of penitents (<i>ordo paenitentium</i>) to atone for her bigamous behaviour.

The entry of an honourable lady into the order of penitents seems to have aroused great public interest in the city of Rome. Interestingly, Jerome adds that this episode happened ‘ante diem paschae’, thereby probably stressing the import of Fabiola’s act, choosing to retire from the Christian fold as a penitent right before the most important Christian festival. Jerome presents Fabiola’s case as an example of how a Christian even of the highest social standing should not refrain from abasing themself in front of the community.

Saturnalia, originally an agricultural festival to honor the god Saturn, traditionally began with a mass animal sacrifice on December 17 at the temple of Saturn. This was followed by a huge banquet for the whole city. The rest of the week was given over to riotous parties, and all shops, law courts, and schools were closed. Even normal rules of behavior were suspended; public drunkenness and gambling were allowed, and for one day of the week, slaves were treated as equals. Another popular custom associated with Saturnalia was the exchange of gifts, especially to children. Even though Theodosius the Great had banned all pagan worship back in 385, people continued to celebrate Saturnalia, and Christians treated it as a secular holiday rather than a religious one."<sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Macrobius wrote of Saturnalia that "the proximity of the holiday to the winter solstice indicated that really all the divinities were subsumed under a monotheism of sun worship; as he wrote, 'The Whole is One.' He did not see the sun as an actual god but as a representation of an abstract deity whose blessings permeated the earth and everything in it.  ... Macrobius did not mention Christianity in his catalogue of deities; he was probably too politic to do so in the reign of the pious Placidia. However, his analysis of the underlying meaning of the popular holiday made it easy to make the birth of Jesus the reason for the celebration; the pagan tradition became a monotheistic celebration of the return of the son of God to a dark world."<sup id="cite_ref-525" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-525">[525]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The remnants of the old sun veration and the linking of the Nativity celebration with Saturnalia were not fully stamped out until long after Placidia's death.
