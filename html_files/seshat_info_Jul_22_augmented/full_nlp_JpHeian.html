Nearly sixty years later, in 894, Sugawara no Michizane was chosen to head another embassy to China, perhaps in response to a request relayed from Chinese officials (or so it was made to seem), but before the embassy could be dispatched Emperor Uda and the Council of State accepted Michizane's recommendation that official relations with China be terminated. Japanese intercourse with China thereafter was abandoned entirely to private hands, except for a  few exchanges of messages with the king of the southern Chinese coastal state of Wu-yiieh around the middle of the tenth century and another exchange with the Sung court in the 1070s.'

The imperial court maintained centralized control over the main islands of Japan and was the centre of a vast, highly bureaucratic administration system.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_JpHeian] The period's peak can be considered to run from 794 to 930 CE, a phase of prosperity and cultural and artistic florescence.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_JpHeian] However, the imperial court's isolation from the realities of government, elaborate internal power dynamics and court intrigues eventually weakened the central government and contributed to the rise of the provincial warrior class.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_JpHeian] The period ends with the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Beginning in the proceeding Nara period, the imperial court had based its bureaucratic system on that of the 'statutory' (<i>ritsuryō</i>) regime of the Chinese T'ang court. The Nara style of administration continued to be implemented by the Heian emperors until the 850s CE. While the government still maintained 'the conception and rhetoric of Confucian government', its functions were carried out by other means, with increased competition for offices, and, due to the dominance of the Fujiwara family, an increasingly narrow focus on factional concerns.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_JpHeian] Although knowledge of Chinese culture had been considered the mark of a cultured individual for much of the Heian period, by its end a distinctly Japanese cultural identity had started to emerge.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Over the course of the Heian period, the imperial family and nobility became increasingly divorced from the realities of government, preoccupying themselves with 'dilettantish pastimes' and matters of protocol above matters of state. While this led to a florescence of the arts and the refinement of etiquette, it also indirectly allowed the provincial warrior class to increase their power because the day-to-day tasks of governance in the provinces were left to them.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_JpHeian] Another factor in the rise and consolidation of power by the warrior class at the expense of the nobility was the changing patterns of land ownership. By the late 10th century CE, with the end of public land allotment, private land ownership had proliferated, much of which was exempt from taxation, significantly affecting the revenue of the government. The nobles' presence at court meant that vast private land holdings were controlled by estate managers on behalf of absentee landlords - further weakening the centralized government and contributing to the emergence of feudalism in Japan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_JpHeian] The personal power of the emperors also waned throughout the period, with the rising prominence of imperial regents, consolidating the power of the Fujiwara family, and the early abdication of emperors in attempts to form a 'cloister government' to counter the Fujiwara regents' control of young puppet rulers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The institution of a standing army of professional warriors contributed to the rise of a class of militarized landed gentry in the provinces. This in turn laid the foundation for the rise of the shogunate, the military government which would dominate Japan until the 1800s, leaving the emperor as little more than a figurehead.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The polity population ranged from roughly four million in 800 CE to five or six million by 1100 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpHeian] Kyoto became the largest settlement, with an estimated population of 200,000 from 800 to 925 CE; 175,000 in the 11th century; and 150,000 by 1150 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpHeian]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Heian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Heian_800CE: 794CE-899CE; Heian_900CE: 900CE-999CE; Heian_1000CE: 1000CE-1099CE; Heian_1100CE: 1100CE-1184CE; Heian_1200CE: 1185CE-1185CE ♥</b>  Heian_1000CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpHeian] Heian_1100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_JpHeian] Heian_1200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_JpHeian] Heian_800CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_JpHeian] Heian_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_JpHeian]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  266234: 794CE-899CE;  266234: 900CE-999CE;  288927: 1000CE-1099CE;  297766: 1100CE-1184CE;  297766: 1185CE-1185CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Japonic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Japanesic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Japanese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Gréine Jordan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpHeian&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [250,000-300,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to map, provinces in the Heian period covered the whole of Japan, minus the island of Hokkaido.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_JpHeian]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ 4,000,000: 800 CE; [4,400,000-5,600,000]: 900 CE; [4,500,000-5,000,000]: 1000 CE; [5,500,000-6,300,000]: 1100 CE ♥</b>[4,400,000-5,600,000]: 950 CE (using for 900 CE); [5,500,000-6,300,000]: 1150 CE (using for 1100 CE) population estimate by Farris [MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]4,000,000: 800CE; 4,500,000: 1000CE (using [4,500,000-5,000,000] on basis more recent Farris estimates are higher, but don't want to estimate too high i.e. linear in case there was cause for population drop/famine/warfare etc.); 5,750,000:1100CE.

Subsequently there was a period of two centuries during which the Fujiwara family dominated the court and governed through puppet emperors. This meant that administration paid at least as much attention to narrow Fujiwara family concerns as to broad national interests. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR] 'Down through the administrative structure - from the heads of offices around the emperor to those in charge of local offices in distant regions - ran a hierarchy of office titles and ranks. Heads of the highest offices held the title of director (kami) who had assistants (suke), secretaries (jo), and clerks (sakan). (These four office titles were written with different characters but pronounced in the same way when held by officials serving in different ministries and agencies.) According to the Yoro adminstrative code of 718, the number of officials in the two councils and eight ministries totaled 331. If lower-ranking officials are added, the total was 6,487. Ranks provided a more precise indication of status than titles did, for officeholders with the same title had different ranks yielding different stipends and perquisites. The Taiho code set aside four imperial ranks (hon) for princes and near relatives of the emperor and thirty court ranks (kurai) for persons lower in the aristocratic order. The son or grandson of a nobleman holding the highest imperial rank was automatically awarded a junior fifth rank lower grade court rank when he reached the age of twenty-one. Special treatment for anyone with a fifth rank or above - apart from the rights that their sons had to a high rank when they turned twenty-one, irrespective of ability - is revealed by the generous stipends and retainers they received'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_JpHeian] 'The structure of the imperial court was a complex affair. The following chart depicts the basic outline, but each division and ministry contained a hierarchy of officials. Some divisions also included subdivisions.

Shinto, the “way of the kami (gods),” is the term used to describe Japan’s indigenous tradition, although Shinto as an organized tradition with common doctrines and practices probably dates back no further than the medieval period.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_198_JpHeian] ‘The foreign traditions of Buddhism and Christianity impacted Japan during the medieval and early modern periods. Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the sixth century from the Asian mainland and quickly became the religion of the aristocrats and the imperial family, thus assuming political significance. It was not until Japan’s medieval period that Buddhism became broadly diffused throughout Japanese society.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_199_JpHeian] ‘Although individual Japanese religions can be discussed, it is important to bear in mind that in many periods of Japanese history—including the medieval and early modern—distinctions between traditions were not very sharply drawn. This was true both in terms of a person’s worship and in terms of Japanese culture more generally.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_200_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Religious rituals, though directed to numerous different ends, were often intended for life cycle events such as birth, marriage, and death. Religion was often intimately connected to the everyday, rather than directed beyond daily life. Festivals, too, celebrated various key events in the life of a community. Festivals were held in celebration of the harvest, the New Year, and to honor the spirits of the dead. Both rituals and festivals were methods of personal purification, showing appreciation for the fertility of the land, making offerings to honor the gods, Buddhas, and ancestors, requesting help in troubled times, and seeking the welfare of the community.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_201_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR] ‘Annual observances celebrated at the imperial court beginning in the Heian period (794-1185[CE]) differed radically from those held in farm villages. Whereas court ceremonies derived in large part from Chinese customs, village rituals tended to be indigenous and related to rice agriculture.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_202_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'One of the more significant developments of the one hundred and fifty years before the beginning of the Heian period was the creation of capital cities designed on a Chinese model. That development was significant for two major reasons. First, it suggests that the state was conceived of in a radically different way than it had been in the past; second, it brings to light a new type of relationship between the center and the periphery, and between the imperial lineage and its surrounding houses and clans. In the realm of ritual and liturgical organization this meant, consequently, that centralized ritual practices would play a strategic role in the formulation of imperial legitimacy.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_203_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Ritual and liturgical practices of the Heian period are marked by the creation or enlargement of shrines (jinja) and temples (tera) supported by the government, by the codification of rituals performed therein, by the emergence of new schools of Buddhism, by the appearance of a preeminence of practice over theory, and by the association of kami with buddhas and bodhisattvas worshiped in adjacent Buddhist temples. These associations resulted in the emergence of specific cults of great importance, the analysis of which yields an adequate understanding of varied but distinctly related dimensions of Heian cultic life.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_204_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'A salient feature of the world of shrines during the Heian period was the reformulation and codification of ritual practices under the aegis of the government and the dominant sacerdotal lineages.This reformulation appears in the Procedures of the Jogan Era {Jogan gishiki) promulgated in 869-71, and in the Procedures of the Engi Era {Engi shiki), completed in 927 but promulgated in 967, which unified the preceding procedures. These documents indicate that the "worship of the kami of Heaven and Earth" was redefined during the Heian period according to specific notions held by the government. Indeed, although little information is available on ritual conduct before the Heian period, it is probable, and in some cases evident, that most of the rituals classified and determined in great detail in those Procedures were substantially different in the Nara period.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_205_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Even a cursory reading of the Engi shiki impresses upon the reader the fundamental features of ritual in shrines during the Heian period: the performance of codified behavior on the part of a strictly defined social body within the confines of particular spatial arrangements at strictly defined times of the year, month, and day, and focusing on a specific relationship to a divine entity, expressed by purification and by various offerings among which the offering and sharing of food took precedence.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_206_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Shinto</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Unlike many religions, Shinto has no founder and does not view any single text as its sole scripture. Shinto is closely associated with the Japanese sense of cultural identity. Shinto emphasizes practice over thought or formal doctrine. There is not a formal Shinto theology or rigidly codified set of moral rules. Shinto is intimately connected with the agricultural cycle and a sense of the sacredness of the natural world. The worship of kami and other ritual practices express these concerns... Ritual practice is central to Shinto traditions and includes such activities as purification, food offerings, dance, and festivals honoring the gods. While kami may be worshipped at shrines under the supervision of Shinto priests (kannushi), they can also be worshipped individually at a shrine or in the home. Further, Shinto associations (ko) provide yet another avenue for interaction with the kami.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_207_JpHeian] ‘On the one hand, Shinto describes an organized set of doctrines and practices related to the state. This perspective on Shinto is strongly tied to the mythology and founding stories of the imperial family, especially as expressed in the Kojiki (Record of ancient matters, compiled in 712). Shinto was important to the legitimating narratives by which the imperial family justified its right to rule. This aspect of Shinto was conspicuous for the rituals performed expressing the intimate connection between emperor and kami.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_208_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'there is a question concerning the definition of phenomena to which the tradition itself gave the name Shinto. When the term appears during the medieval period, it refers to specific ritual and doctrinal systems related to particular shrine-temple multiplexes, never to an overarching, nationally accepted body of doctrine and ritual. "Shinto" as a system of belief totally independent from Buddhism did not exist before the Edo period, and even then the term denoted a system heavily impacted by Neo-Confucianism, Taoism, and yinyang notions and practices. In the Heian period the realm of shrines exhibited indigenous and imported creeds, practices, and institutions; these were rarely at odds with the world of temples.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_JpHeian][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b> Buddhism</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Buddhism originated in India and spread to China about four centuries after the time of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni (ca. fifth to fourth century, B.C.). It was transmitted to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula around the middle of the sixth century. The cultural gulf that existed at that time between Japan on the one hand and China and Korea on the other was considerable. Japan's ruling class accepted Buddhism as the embodiment of an advanced and superior civilization, and in order to gain control over the concepts and technology that Buddhism brought to Japan, the elite provided a succession of large temples where Buddhism could put down roots.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_210_JpHeian]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpHeian&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ Aoi Matsuri ♥</b> "In the life of Heian, no ritual or ceremony was more representative of the capital and its society than the regular Kamo Festival, which took place every year in the fourth month. The festival was both ritual and ceremony, functioning on the one hand to guard the city and its people, and on the other to affirm and display the bonds that held the community together. It was also, as almost all rituals and ceremonies were in part, an entertainment, providing one of the great spectacles of the city's year...The explicit purpose of the Kamo Festival was to pay homage to the Kamo deities and to secure their protection of the court and the capital. Originally worshiped as deities of the ancient Kamo clan, the gods were enshrined in two locations in the northern part of the Kyoto basin: at the Lower Shrine near the confluence of the Kamo and Takano rivers and at the Upper Shrine a couple of miles farther north on the east bank of the Kamo. There were two central figures in the festival: the Kamo Vestal and the Imperial Messenger. The Vestal was a near-princess chosen by divination at the beginning of each reign, or whenever the post fell vacant. Her role is not altogether clear, although it is  obvious that it was modeled on that of the Ise Vestal, who was considered the Chief Priestess of the Ise Shrines and lived there. The Kamo Vestal, who was first appointed in the reign of Emperor Saga, lived at a special palace called Murasakinoin on the northwest outskirts of the capital. Her role seems to have been simply to maintain ritual purity and to represent the emperor at the festival. The Imperial Messenger was a Fifth-Rank courtier holding the office of Middle or Lesser Captain of the Imperial Guards, and thus usually a man destined for high office. He read an imperial rescript at the shrines and presented the emperor's offerings, which was the chief object of the festival. The Vestal and the Messenger were accompanied by ten dancers and twelve musicians, who were also courtiers from the Imperial Guards. Their duty was to perform an ensemble of music, dance, and song called "Eastern Music" (Azumaasobi) at the shrines." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_211_JpHeian] NOTE: Aoi Matsuri is an alternative name for this festival. The following is most likely also relevant: "The structure and meaning of the [typical Shinto] festival follows a basic tripartite sequence, namely the invocation of the kami , the offerings to the kami , and the final communion with the kami at the shrine (jinja). At the invocation of the kami , the priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves (shūbatsu) in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the go-shintai (symbol of the kami) is viewed by the priests. Priests are also expected to practice abstinence (saikai) before major festivals. With the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando (the approach road to the shrine) to meet the kami at the appointed place. It is here that the duly purified laypeople become responsible for transporting the kami around the shrine precincts and throughout the community, in an omikoshi , for example. "Offerings to the kami (shinsen) come next, normally comprising rice; salt; water; rice wine (sake); rice cakes (omochi); fish, usually tai (seabream); seaweed (konbu); vegetables; grain; and fruit. Speeches are made, after which the ritual part of the festival is closed. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals, particularly kagura, a dance performed by shrine maidens (miko). Bugaku is another genre of classical Japanese dance with special music. The entire cycle of Noh drama has its roots in Shinto myths, rituals, and festivals. Kami are portrayed in the introductions to the various epics."Finally, there is communion with the kami (naorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu (a square cup made of Japanese cypress). The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often becomes a major party with the organizers, the high priest, and other priests present for as long as worshippers remain. In past eras, a liberal view was taken of sexual activities during such periods of celebration."

Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_JpHeian] For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson [MAJIDBENAM_REF_265_JpHeian], that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai.

[...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_306_JpHeian] "The rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto. [...] It must be added, however, that few of the ‘old rituals’ survived intact after the Meiji government’s radical revamping and restructuring of Shinto so that it could serve as a national creed (see Hardacre 1989)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_307_JpHeian] "In large shrines, the routine and rituals of the day are fixed throughout the year; whether or not visitors come to the shrine, these are followed. [...] At [8 a.m. every morning] the act of morning worship (<i>cho-hai</i>) takes place, involving all the shrine priests and staff. The <i>norito</i> is recited, the staff purified for the day, and announcements made about the day's events and duties." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_308_JpHeian] "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami."

The festival was both ritual and ceremony, functioning on the one hand to guard the city and its people, and on the other to affirm and display the bonds that held the community together. It was also, as almost all rituals and ceremonies were in part, an entertainment, providing one of the great spectacles of the city's year...The explicit purpose of the Kamo Festival was to pay homage to the Kamo deities and to secure their protection of the court and the capital. Originally worshiped as deities of the ancient Kamo clan, the gods were enshrined in two locations in the northern part of the Kyoto basin: at the Lower Shrine near the confluence of the Kamo and Takano rivers and at the Upper Shrine a couple of miles farther north on the east bank of the Kamo. There were two central figures in the festival: the Kamo Vestal and the Imperial Messenger. The Vestal was a near-princess chosen by divination at the beginning of each reign, or whenever the post fell vacant. Her role is not altogether clear, although it is  obvious that it was modeled on that of the Ise Vestal, who was considered the Chief Priestess of the Ise Shrines and lived there. The Kamo Vestal, who was first appointed in the reign of Emperor Saga, lived at a special palace called Murasakinoin on the northwest outskirts of the capital. Her role seems to have been simply to maintain ritual purity and to represent the emperor at the festival. The Imperial Messenger was a Fifth-Rank courtier holding the office of Middle or Lesser Captain of the Imperial Guards, and thus usually a man destined for high office. He read an imperial rescript at the shrines and presented the emperor's offerings, which was the chief object of the festival. The Vestal and the Messenger were accompanied by ten dancers and twelve musicians, who were also courtiers from the Imperial Guards. Their duty was to perform an ensemble of music, dance, and song called "Eastern Music" (Azumaasobi) at the shrines." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_344_JpHeian] NOTE: Aoi Matsuri is an alternative name for this festival. The following is most likely also relevant: "The structure and meaning of the [typical Shinto] festival follows a basic tripartite sequence, namely the invocation of the kami , the offerings to the kami , and the final communion with the kami at the shrine (jinja). At the invocation of the kami , the priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves (shūbatsu) in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the go-shintai (symbol of the kami) is viewed by the priests. Priests are also expected to practice abstinence (saikai) before major festivals. With the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando (the approach road to the shrine) to meet the kami at the appointed place. It is here that the duly purified laypeople become responsible for transporting the kami around the shrine precincts and throughout the community, in an omikoshi , for example. "Offerings to the kami (shinsen) come next, normally comprising rice; salt; water; rice wine (sake); rice cakes (omochi); fish, usually tai (seabream); seaweed (konbu); vegetables; grain; and fruit. Speeches are made, after which the ritual part of the festival is closed. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals, particularly kagura, a dance performed by shrine maidens (miko). Bugaku is another genre of classical Japanese dance with special music. The entire cycle of Noh drama has its roots in Shinto myths, rituals, and festivals. Kami are portrayed in the introductions to the various epics."Finally, there is communion with the kami (naorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu (a square cup made of Japanese cypress). The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often becomes a major party with the organizers, the high priest, and other priests present for as long as worshippers remain. In past eras, a liberal view was taken of sexual activities during such periods of celebration."

This belief has it that man's body is inhabited by the Three Worms (san shih) who are responsible for aging and loss of vitality. Ways and means to counteract their activity have been devised by the Taoists whose main concern always was to prolong life and gain immortality. One of the worms is living in the head and causing blindness, deafness, baldness, loss of teeth, stuffy nose and bad breath. The second worm inhabits the breast causing there heart palpitation, asthme, and melancholia. The third worm dwells in the loins and causes intestinal cramps, drying of the bones, fading of the skin, rheumatism in the legs, aching of the wrists, weakening of the mind and will. These vindictive enemies of man's mental and physical health and life are always out to destroy the body in which they feel imprisoned, and waiting for the death of their host. On Koshin days, of which there are six every year, the three guests of the human body ascend to Heaven and report there all misdeeds of their man for which the heavenly director of human destiny shortens the respective man's life, by 300 days for greater guilts, by three for minor ones. The worms however can only escape to Heaven while the person is sleeping, and to avoid sleeping was therefore the only safeguard against harm done by the fearful report to Heaven.//"With the influx of Chinese ideas also the Koshin belief reached Japan some time in the Nara period (710-780), if not earlier, and we find it fully developed in the ninth century. The related reports say that in the court and in aristocratic circles the Koshin machi, or Koshin vigil, was celebrated in the form of a banquet with all kinds of amusements in line with the refined taste of Heian aristocracy. Later when other mighty clans had come to power, they too enjoyed the Koshin celebrations, but it seems that they did it primarily for the sake of entertainment, less out of a belief in the fateful consequences of an omission of them."

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_610_JpHeian]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> In the synchretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions. Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_611_JpHeian]  According to Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_612_JpHeian] “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_613_JpHeian]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> In the synchretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

This point is captured in one of the central Buddhist virtues: dana, which is ‘giving’ or ‘generosity’. ‘Giving’ creates a win-win situation. Not only is the gift’s recipient benefited but also the gift’s donor - particularly from a Buddhist point of view, since through giving one counters attachment in its deep-seated form of greedy grasping, of not letting-go.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_615_JpHeian]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> In the synchretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu (a square cup made of Japanese cypress). The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_671_JpHeian] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_672_JpHeian]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended.

The purpose of purification is to remove tsumi (impurity) and kegare (impurity caused by various human conditions) and restore human nature to its primal and pure state. Thus the idea that human nature can in some sense return to its divine origins lies behind all other related concepts. [...] Human beings are born able to live in harmony with the divine and with nature, but because of the various forms of impurity that overtake life, purification becomes necessary. Hence the importance of purification to effect restoration.// The goal to be achieved by the performance of misogi shuho , purification using water, is the cultivation of reisei , the Shinto ideal of spirituality.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000).
