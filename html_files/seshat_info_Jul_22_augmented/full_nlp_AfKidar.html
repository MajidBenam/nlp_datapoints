It seems likely that the administrative and government structure created by the Kushans was left largely intact under the Kidarites."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_172_AfKidar][MAJIDBENAM_BR] During the Kidarite period there was "a local variety of Zoroastrianism (Mazdaism) in Tokharistan, various expressions of Buddhism and Hinduism in the territory of Gandhara and also, probably, the official Sasanian doctrine."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_173_AfKidar]</div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Dr Julia Shaw ♥</b>"In spite of the scanty evidence, fragmentary in many respects, we can draw some general conclusions about religious life throughout the territory of the Kushans. It was highly developed and differentiated. The religious movements of India - Sivaism, Vishnuism, Jainism and Buddhism with their different schools - penetrated Central Asia, as did Indian merchants when Kushan rule facilitated long-distance international trade. In eastern Iran the Indian religions met the Greek divinities, Zoroastrianism and many local pre-Zoroastrian forms of worship, and encountered the ancient Iranian religious ideas of the northern Iranian equestrian nomads. The Kushan kings selected for themselves from this immense variety those religious elements, ideas and forms of cults which fitted their ancient religious traditions and strengthened the religious ideology of their royal power. So the ‘Kushan pantheon’ appearing on the coins represents only a selection of the religious cults of their empire.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"None the less, the Kushan kings were well aware of the current trends in religious life and followed them. The most important was syncretism. The great religions influenced one another and began slowly to absorb the local cults. In Bactria the syncretic cult of Siva achieved great success; and on the coins of Bazodeo (Vasudcva), the last Great Kushan king, Siva was the sole divinity used, a figure that apparently combined Greek, Iranian and non-Sivaite Indian elements."

However, it seems like a reasonable inference that Nowruz, the Zoroastrian New Year/Spring festival, would have been an important celebration, given its continuous popularity from (at least) Arsacid times up until the twentieth century [MAJIDBENAM_REF_175_AfKidar]. That it would have been celebrated by non-Zoroastrians as well as Zoroastrians is suggested by two things: first, the fact that Zoroastrian orthodoxy never appears to have firmly established itself in this NGA, and, second, by the fact that the festival was celebrated by all in Islamic times [MAJIDBENAM_REF_176_AfKidar], which suggests that something about it (most likely its euphoric nature, and the fact that it celebrated something as "natural" as the coming of Spring) facilitated inclusion. Unfortunately, there are no descriptions of how this festival would have been celebrated under Kushan rule; however, the earliest description of this festival dates to the immediately preceding polity, the Parthians, and it may therefore be used as a reasonable analogue for Kushan Nowruz--though, of course, an expert would have to confirm this. "The Arsacid period also provides the earliest description of Nowruz festivities. This comes from the romantic epic Vis u Ramin, which was identified by V. M. Minorsky (1946, 1947, 1954 and 1962, with all these articles collected and revised by him in 1964, pp. 151-99) as by origin a Parthian oral work, which has passed through an MP version and exists in the classical Persian rendering of Gorgāni (ed. M. A. Todua and A.A. Gwakharia. French tr. by H. Mass é. Eng. tr. by G. Morrison, in which the episodes are numbered as in the earlier editions by M. Minovi and M. J. Mahjub.  For further bibliography see de Blois, 1992, pp. 165-67).  The poem has plainly undergone revisions and extensions in the course of its long transmission, but much has been shown to belong to the Parthian original.  This includes the royal banquet with which the poem begins.  Not only is such a banquet a characteristic way to launch an epic, but what happens at this one is essential to the story.  The host is Mobad, lord of Marv, that is, a vassal king of the Arsacids; but in the epic his concept often blurs, as here, with that of a Parthian Great King.  So he is termed lord of the earth and greatest of all kings, and his guests are vassal kings and nobles, with their ladies, from all parts of Iran, including Pārs.  The banquet is held in the open, under blossoming trees, and wine flows freely to the sound of minstrelsy and birdsong.  Meantime the King’s humbler subjects are also celebrating out of doors, in field and garden, likewise with wine and music, some racing their horses, others dancing or picking flowers; and in the days that follow the King rides out, magnificently attended, and distributes largess lavishly.

So he is termed lord of the earth and greatest of all kings, and his guests are vassal kings and nobles, with their ladies, from all parts of Iran, including Pārs.  The banquet is held in the open, under blossoming trees, and wine flows freely to the sound of minstrelsy and birdsong.  Meantime the King’s humbler subjects are also celebrating out of doors, in field and garden, likewise with wine and music, some racing their horses, others dancing or picking flowers; and in the days that follow the King rides out, magnificently attended, and distributes largess lavishly.

Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_517_AfKidar] Hinduism: “According to Hindu Dharmashastras, of the four stages of life, the person who is at the householder stage is the anchor of society. The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grand- children and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving—dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have “cast off” from the settled world of “this shore.” ” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_518_AfKidar] Zoroastrianism: Cantera says that 'from its very beginnings Zoroastrianism has developed an ethical imperative of assistance to the needy members of the community'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_519_AfKidar]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ inferred present ♥</b> There was "a local variety of Zoroastrianism (Mazdaism) in Tokharistan, various expressions of Buddhism and Hinduism in the territory of Gandhara and also, probably, the official Sasanian doctrine."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_520_AfKidar] That charity was an important moral value in the Kidarite kingdom may be inferred, perhaps, from the fact that it is promoted by all four of the above-mentioned world religions. Buddhism: “Living a morally good life thus always brings a twofold benefit: Others are aided and one’s own spiritual development or karmic disposition is positively affected. This point is captured in one of the central Buddhist virtues: dana, which is ‘giving’ or ‘generosity’. ‘Giving’ creates a win-win situation. Not only is the gift’s recipient benefited but also the gift’s donor - particularly from a Buddhist point of view, since through giving one counters attachment in its deep-seated form of greedy grasping, of not letting-go.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_521_AfKidar] Hinduism: “According to Hindu Dharmashastras, of the four stages of life, the person who is at the householder stage is the anchor of society. The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grand- children and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom.

Buddhism: “If ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’ constitute the one root of suffering - both the suffering one undergoes oneself in sansaric existence, and the suffering one inflicts upon others - it follows that any successful attempt to reduce one’s ‘thirst’ and to moderate one’s ‘attachment’ will also result in a life causing less suffering (at least less deliberately-inflicted suffering) to others - and this is what morality basically means for Buddhism: reducing suffering, alleviating suffering, causing less suffering. Morality is an intrinsic part of the path to salvation because it is part and parcel of the salvific process of overcoming ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_527_AfKidar] Hinduism: “Universal dharma relates to all humanity and it includes ethical virtues such as compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence. These virtues that are said to be common to all humans are known as sadhārana (common) or sanatana (eternal) dharma. For example, the Law of Manu (X:63) argues that non-injury, truth, not stealing, purity and control of the senses summarise dharma for the four castes. Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is. Nevertheless, in theory, the ethical virtues of compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence are universally regarded by most Hindus.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_528_AfKidar]  Zoroastrianism: for a Zoroastrian worshipper, "The moral requirements of his faith make him self-reliant, bearing the responsibility for his own conduct and ultimate fate".

By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them. Similarly, actions intended to cause suffering will lead to suffering for those who commit them." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_606_AfKidar] In Zoroastrianism, the following quote makes it clear the supreme god, Ahura Mazda, was both responsible for the creation of the world and for punishing transgressors. "[T]he prophet feels also the awe due to the God who is “Creator of all” (Y. 44.7), and who, as Lord of aša, presides over a strict justice for mankind by which the wicked, who have chosen to act “at Lie’s commands” (Y. 31.1) will be in due course condemned. Their destination is the Worst Existence, i.e., Hell, which has been brought into being by Angra Mainyu (Y. 30.4). Mazdā has “appointed recompenses” (Y. 43.5), decreeing that “the end shall be different for each” (Y. 48.4); but he “has left to men’s wills (the choice between) holy and unholy” (Y. 45.9), and it is their own inner selves (daēnā-) which lead sinners to destruction (Y. 51.13)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_607_AfKidar]  In Buddhism: "There are numerous Higher Gods, but these are remote and sublime beings who have little involvement in human affairs.

No less than 84 of the 101 chapters (according to the standard modern editions) of this text deal with hell; it is the most detailed description of the other world available in Zoroastrian literature.

In Buddhism: "The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is punya (Pali punna ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ (karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome (kusla/kusala)deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dana), ethical conduct (sila/sila ), and meditation (bhavana ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_612_AfKidar] "The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action (karma/kamma-patha)which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action - strong greed, hatred, and delusion  - lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction."

According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life. Then, after a certain amount of time, the individual would be reborn on earth once again. The mechanism that regulated this system was karman, a word that literally means "action." Every action must have an effect. So, the effects of one’s actions in life determine what one will experience after death, and what kind of life one will have in the next birth. In this way, even if a person does not seem to receive all the rewards or punishments deserved in a particular life, the scales will be balanced in the future."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_616_AfKidar] In Zoroastrianism: "The easiest way to avoid hell, of course, is to accumulate more good thoughts, words or deeds than bad. Some virtues, however, are praised as particularly efficient to avoid hell.20 A catechism highlights gratefulness (ČHP 30 [= Kanga 1960:16-17]). This virtue is also praised in the wisdom literature as a way to save one’s soul (Dk. VI 120; E38c; E45f [= Shaked 1979:48-49; 206-7; 214-15]), sometimes in conjunction with other virtues such as contentment and tenderness. Generosity is also emphasized as saving the soul from hell (Dk. IX 6.3 [see West 1892:179]), as is righteousness (Dk. IX 17.3 [see West 1892:204])."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_617_AfKidar] In Buddhism: "In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (punna, Sanskrit: punya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital - like money in a bank account - whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples."

In Buddhism: "As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsaric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21)."

Not all Brahmins have been priests and not all Kshatriyas have been rulers. The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life. To that extent they would receive greater respect than Kshatriyas."

Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (punna, Sanskrit: punya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital - like money in a bank account - whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_655_AfKidar] "The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled <i>Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications</i>. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste."
