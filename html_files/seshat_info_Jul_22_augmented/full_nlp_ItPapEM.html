[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 1030 CE ♥</b> {1050 CE; 1010-1030 CE} The German Emperor Henry III, <i>de facto</i> guardian of the papacy and the Patrimony, granted the city of Benevento to Pope Leo IX.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItPapEM] This marked the definitive end of an independent polity centered on the city of Benevento, which had threatened the Patrimony for several centuries from the south (this Lombard menace, from north and south, was the original reason for the Frankish descent into Italy and the Frankish conquest of the Lombard Kingdom of Italy). It also was the furthest extent of (nominal) papal power until Pope Innocent III (r. 1198-1216) began consolidating what would become the Papal States.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapEM] The period from 1036 to 1066 was characterized, however, by internal warfare and Salian invasions (despite the short-lived expansionist respite of 1049-1054 ending after Civitella). Thus, it could be argued that the real peak of the polity was under the Tusculan Reform Papacy c.1012-1036 CE because of internal and external stability, and socioeconomic and (even if limited) demographic expansion.

During his pontificate, the papacy began consolidating its control over Lazio and expanding its power through what would become the Papal States; simultaneously, Innocent III brought papal authority to its medieval height, initiating several crusades and presiding over the Fourth Lateran Council.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b>  In general, this period was marked by a high degree of fragmentation and sub-regional autonomy, with various areas of the Patrimony of St. Peter virtually independent of the Papacy or subject to central powers in a very nominal way.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItPapEM] Papal sovereignty over central Lazio was rarely in question,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItPapEM] yet the papacy's ability to control subject cities and defend its territory from outside threats was often minimal, particularly in regard to territory on the fringes of papal control.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItPapEM] For example, the city of Gaeta, in the extreme south of Lazio, was <i>de facto</i> independent of the papacy by the early 10th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItPapEM] In the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, the papacy was frequently at war with the German emperors, causing serious destabilization of political authority in the Patrimony. I should emphasize, however, that it is difficult to pin down which of these terms is most accurate, since the papacy frequently entered alliances during this period, and significant parts of the Patrimony were <i>de facto</i> annexed by the Empire for decades at a time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥</b> Papal relations with other polities fluctuated dramatically during this period; I coded it as "vassalage" to reflect the fact that the papacy during this period was often dominated by the German emperors.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Rome - Republic of St Peter I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Papal State I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Latin Christendom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 17,000,000  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Rome ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Latin ♥</b> Latin remained the sole language of administration, diplomacy, liturgy, and culture throughout the period.

The population of Rome languished at a relative historical low of 35,000 people throughout this period, which was marked by a high degree of fragmentation and sub-regional autonomy. Various areas of the Patrimony of St. Peter were virtually independent of the Papacy or subject to central authority only in a very nominal way.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Through the 904-1198 CE period the polity, with its capital at Rome, was dominated by powerful families and a powerful foreign state.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItPapEM] Figures divided by three to roughly approximate population ruled by this polity would be 1,666,000: 1000 CE; 1,916,000: 1100 CE.  The "Latium: Medieval Era (500-1500 CE)" coding page currently estimates the population of the Latium region only as: 335000: 904 CE; 110000: 1422 CE. These estimates for Latium conflict with the crude estimates based on the McEvedy and Jones figures for the whole of Italy since the latter do not drop from 850-1450 CE, they rise.

Responsible for maintaining clerical discipline and for overseeing the property of the church, he was answerable only to the pope. Only he could perform all the sacraments; he alone performed the sacrament of confirmation and by the sacrament of ordination passed on his power to others. Theoretically, canon law held that he would be elected by the clergy and people of his diocese. In practice, he was elected only by the canon priests attached to the cathedral. Considered high clergy, the canons aided the bishop in furthering his agenda, administering the diocese and performing rituals at the cathedral church. At their head was the dean, the highest officer in the diocese. A diocesian chancellor supervised the cathedral school and issued licenses allowing clerics to teach and preach in the diocese. A treasurer oversaw finances, while a precentor managed the choir and organized the cathedral's musical program. Each diocese was divided into administrative districts, over which presided the archdeacons. Practically, these were powerful men; they were the bishop's legates, charged with enforcing discipline among the lower clergy, and therefore they were often quite unpopular. ...

There were clearly several such leaders at anyone time, as the Liber Pontiﬁcalis makes clear in, for example, its account of the contested papal election of 855, and other senior military ﬁgures sometimes appear, such as Cesario (son of Sergio magister militum), ordinatus super exercitum in 849. A hierarchy of rank appears earlier in 855, when Daniele magister equitum accused Graziano, eminentissimus magistro militum et Romani palatii (or Romanae urbis) superista, clearly his superior, of disloyalty to the Carolingians, a charge he could not sustain. Apart from this, however, the structure of the military side of Rome’s aristocratic hierarchies is obscure to us. A set of military offices appear in a wide array of heterogeneous texts, but we cannot put them into a credible ordering. We can say, however, that it was normal to call senior military men nobiles, and Cesario di Sergio’s case shows that they had hereditary elements; we shall see in a moment how complex links between families were by 876. The terminology just outlined becomes much less common after the beginning of the tenth century, perhaps because the supreme military leaders were by now Tefilatto and his heirs; but two people are called superista under Alberico, and Otto III brieﬂy revived the ofﬁce of magister militiae.

It was clearly easy for Roman judges and aristocrats to come together frequently, and the more often they did so the more solid their political aggregation."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_108_ItPapEM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is unclear when it developed, but by long-standing custom, popes held a council in Rome itself during Lent to settle any ecclesiastical business (land disputes, lawsuits over rights, quarrels between bishops and their parish churches, etc.). In the late eleventh century, this system was expanded with another seasonal council held in November for the same purpose.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_109_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b> "The point about these placita was thus that they were standardized occasions, run by high-status legal experts, the palatine judges, and legitimated more widely by Rome’s aristocracy.

Pilgrims to Rome would visit the city's shrines, basilicas, and the catacombs of the Roman-era Christians. Graffitti evidence indicates that Anglo-Saxons were visiting Rome's ritual sites as early as 700.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_197_ItPapEM] "Pilgrimages to the eternal city were never unpopular in the Middle Ages, although pilgrims were particularly numerous in certain periods. These pious journeys were in vogue between the eighth and mid-ninth centuries, when the route was relatively safe because of Frankish control of roads. [...] "Rome's greatest attractions were its extensive array of churches and the relics of saints they contained (see also Basilica of St John Lateran). The persecutions and martyrdoms of Christians that occurred in or were associated with Rome ensured its success as a goal for later Christian believers, who prized martyrdom (see alsoMartyrs) and wished to venerate the relics of martyrs for the faith. The relics of saints Peter and Paul were the primary aims of most pilgrims. These two figures became associated in the popular mind, and shared the same feast day (29 June). For this reason, a trip to Rome became known from the fifth century as a visit ad limina apostolorum ("to the thresholds of the Apostles"). Starting in the eighth century, Rome became known as a center for penitential pilgrimage, through which serious sins like homicide could be expiated. Some pilgrims petitioned directly to the pope to have their confessions heard and their sins forgiven. [...] "Pilgrims who went to Rome came from every corner of Western and Eastern Europe, and ranged from rulers (see also Royal Pilgrims) to paupers, encompassing laity, clergy, and the religious. They journeyed on the ancient roads that traversed the Italian peninsula; the well-traveled Via Francigena was a confluence of such paths. Trips to Rome presented particular challenges. A pilgrim approaching from the north would find the Alps impassable in the winter; and the city was infamous for malaria in the summer. The churches of Rome were spread out and some located in virtually deserted areas. Women pilgrims were barred from certain shrines starting in the fifteenth century, and possibly earlier. "[...]. "The problems posed by large crowds of pilgrims thronging to see important relics in Rome led to the construction of annular crypts in some churches, starting with St Peter. These permitted a large number of pilgrims to file by in an orderly fashion. Pilgrims could lower into the tombs cloths, which would touch the relics and retain the aura of the saint's holiness. The crowds of pilgrims also led to the creation of galleries for the overflow of pilgrims. "[...] "Medieval travelers, no less than modern ones, employed written guidebooks to orient them to the many churches in the eternal city. These range widely from simple lists of churches to visit to more extensive descriptions of the items churches contained and information on other sites in the city. Notable among these are the sixth-century Cymiteria totius urbis Romanae; the seventh-century guides Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae, De locis sanctis martyrum, and papyri from the cathedral treasury of Monza; the eighth-century Einsiedeln itinerary; the twelfth-century Mirabilia urbis Romae, which was wildly popular and frequently translated and augmented; the Itinerarium Malmesburiense, which was incorporated in the twelfth-century Gesta regum Anglorum of William of Malmesbury; and John Capgrave's The Solace of Pilgrims, written ca. 1451. "The popes had major roles in promoting pilgrimage to the city. They led frequent and dramatic liturgies (see also Liturgy and Pilgrimage) at different churches, which regularly attracted pilgrims. The pontiffs established xenodochia, institutions designed to host them and care for their needs. The popes were the primary benefactors of the churches of Rome, granting them gifts and seeing to their maintenance. "Foreign colonies of various northern European groups that would admit pilgrims of their nationality known as scolae existed near St Peter between the eighth and twelfth century. By the thirteenth century, a greater number of private establishments had grown up for pilgrims. "Pilgrimages had a considerable economic impact on the city of Rome, between alms and fees for food and lodging. While Romans did not normally sell relics, they peddled oil that had been near tombs, and from the twelfth century on, tokens with Peter and Paul and later the Veronica, imitations of the Veronica, and wax discs with the Lamb of God. "While in Rome, pilgrims learned much about the Roman culture and cult, and brought Roman books, souvenirs, liturgies, architecture, iconography, the worship of certain saints, and reverence for the pope back to their homelands."

The numbers of pilgrims were so great that not all were able to gain access to the church, whilst those inside were so tightly packed that they were unable to move. Suger described the agony of many women, who were caught in the crush and were so distressed that they cried out in pain as though in labour, whilst more were trampled underfoot.

The theology behind the ritual changed considerably; during this period there was not the emphasis that would later be placed on the need for children to be baptized to avoid damnation or consignment to Limbo.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_237_ItPapEM] As Thompson phrased it, during the Middle Ages, "Christians were made, not born." He is speaking of the thirteenth century, but the point extends back to the period under discussion.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_238_ItPapEM] Baptismal churches (<i>pievi</i>) were not yet in place during this period, so baptisms presumably happened at the closest <i>Duomo</i>, the mother-church of major settlements (such as the church of San Vitale in Ravenna). The ritual made natural-born children into Christians. So central to the cult was baptism that, in extreme situations, lay people could baptize children, especially if the child was in immediate danger of death.

the mass can be seen as a key ritual in the production of medieval community...."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_281_ItPapEM] There were many varieties of masses, varying in frequency and nature depending on the community involved. Monasteries and convents held several masses a day, in particular masses for the dead.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_282_ItPapEM] Parish priests were supposed to say one mass daily, but it is unclear whether this was common, especially during this period, which predates the general establishment of parish churches in localities. High mass was rare, most likely restricted to high holidays such as Christmas; the laity were only expected to attend mass on Sundays, and even this was not asserted as a fundamental part of orthodox Christianity until a  later period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_283_ItPapEM] A rough description of a typical mass is as follows. The priest read out a psalm on the nature of original sin, followed by hymns on Sundays. Then the priest read from the Gospel, and prepared the bread and wine for the Eucharist (at this point, the laity would give any offerings they had for the collection box). This description is from (Arnold)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_284_ItPapEM] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_285_ItPapEM] The priest then passed the Pax, an object with the crucifix on it, around and the laity kissed it.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_286_ItPapEM] This seems to have taken the place of Communion on days when the laity did not participate in it; mass then ended. Monastic masses and special liturgical masses would have been slightly different, but these were the main elements. NOTE: Most Christians-in fact, probably the vast majority, during this period-did not attend mass on anything approaching a regular basis, perhaps at all.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_287_ItPapEM] Urban people, in particular those in Rome, probably attended church more regularly than, say, those in the remote Appenines, but this is no more than a reasonable hypothesis for this period. I would also like to note the serious paucity of sources, and thus of secondary scholarship, on the early medieval mass in Italy: we simply do not know very much about lived religion in early medieval Europe, and especially in Italy.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> Parish priests were in theory required to say mass daily, but it is almost impossible to know how stringently this was obeyed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_288_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> Swanson, writing of the period after 1215, has noted that "How it [the Mass] fits into a liturgical round is not easily considered, for masses were celebrated with almost mind-boggling regularity and in incaluclable quantities...."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_289_ItPapEM] This was true also of the tenth through the twelfth centuries; while monasteries offered liturgical masses for the dead daily, and as the tenth century went on, this became one of their main functions, especially those reformed by the Cluniacs.

See (Klapisch-Zuber &amp; Herlihy) for a good discussion of the difficulties involved in determining the size of medieval settlements; their source is the Florentine Catasto of 1427, easily the most detailed demographic record that survives for medieval Europe.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_293_ItPapEM] The number of 100 is based on an average-sized medieval settlement with, perhaps, 20 or 30 households/hearths (<i>fuochi</i>).

Because, from a Seshat perspective, they are extremely similar to one another in terms of variables, both shall be coded. At a future date, it might be good to choose one over the other, but this shouldn't make a significant difference. "Trial by combat as a judicial method of settling differences between men began in Europe in the Dark Ages. It is thought that Gundobald, King of Burgundy, was the first ruling prince to introduce it, in about 501 AD. Edward Gibbon explained the trial by combat thus: 'Both in civil and in criminal proceedings, the plaintiff, or accuser, the defendant, or even the witness, were exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs; and it was incumbent on them either to desert their cause or publicly to maintain their honour in the lists of battle.' "According to Gibbon, Gundobald justified the introduction of the trial by combat with the question: 'Is it not true that the event of national wars and private combats is directed by the judgement of God: and that his providence awards victory to the juster cause?' The belief that trial by combat will reveal a just settlement between the contending parties by the operation of God's will underpins the medieval faith in the practice. Force of arms provide an answer, unclouded by false witnesses or fabricated evidence. Gibbons continues, caustically: 'By such prevailing arguments, the absurd and cruel practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to some tribes of Germany, was propagated and established in all the monarchies of Europe, from Sicily to the Baltic.' "Gundobald's law allowed for a duel if the accused persisted in denying the offence under oath and the accuser insisted on proof by force of arms. This remained the essence of trial by combat wherever in Europe it formed part of the judicial process. "[...] Established, as we have seen, in Burgundy, trial by combat soon spread to the rest of France, taking root in the Frankish kingdom and elsewhere. "[...]"The judicial combat, whether in France, Italy or England, was, in essence, the same. It was a public event, sanctioned by the King, openly contested in front of officials, spectators and the monarch on a ground and under conditions that conferred no advantage to either side. The result of the contest was agreed by the parties to be binding. As such it could scarcely more different from the private, illegal and secret encounter that was the modern duel. [...] "As is the case with trial by combat and medieval jousting, the duel of chivalry has obvious claims to be regarded as a precursor of the modern duel. In particular, it existed for the settling of questions touching upon the honour of a knight or a noble. In this respect it is the direct antecedent of the modern duel. However, as with trial by combat, it is distinguished from the modern duel by the fact that it was fight conducted in public with the authority and blessing of the monarch. "As trial by combat developed, so the custom of the parties' employing a champion emerged. A champion was a hired man who fought the trial on his principal's behalf. Although it enabled the principal to avoid the tiresome and dangerous obligation to fight his opponent in the lists, it did not absolve him from the consequences of the result. As one historian puts it, 'As for the principals in a capital fight by proxy, they were kept out of sight of the duel, with a rope round their necks, and the one who was beaten by proxy was immediately hanged in person.'"

Se nei primi anni di vita bambini e bambine ricevevano una educazione di base abbastanza simile, a partire dai sei-sette anni, i primi affinavano la loro istruzione e le loro abilità fuori di casa, mentre le fanciulle rimanevano spesso con le madri e non andavano più in là del livello di istruzione domestica acquisito. In questo contesto tutti gli insegnamenti femminili erano caratterizzati da una rigida praticità, e partivano dal principio che 'il silenzio, la laboriosità, la modestia costituivano quelle basi fondamentali dell’educazione delle bambine, che le donne avrebbero dovuto sviluppare durante le loro vite' (Segura Graiño, 2007: 77)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_434_ItPapEM] Translation (E.C.): Discrimination on the basis of sex was a constant element of everyday life, because, though mothers almost always were their children's first teachers, fathers eventually made sure that their sons' education differed from that of their daughters. Though in the first years of life boys and girls received a fairly similar basic education, starting at the age of six or seven, sons then went on to refine their education and skills outside the home, while daughters often stayed with their mothers and their education did not stretch beyond the requirements of domesticity. In this context, all female education was characterized by a rigid practicality, basedon the principle that 'silence, industriousness, modesty constituted those fundamental bases of the education of girls, which women were expected to develop during their lives' (Segura Graiño, 2007: 77).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Property can be owned by both males and females ♣ no ♥</b> NB The following quote refers to Italy generally in the High Middle Ages; it is possible that women's legal rights were somewhat different in the Papal States, but no source could be found to confirm this. "[I]l pater, oltre ad essere capo indiscusso della casa, era infatti dominus assoluto del patrimonio familiare, che si componeva di diversi cespiti, tra i quali la dote, ossia il vero perno della struttura patrimoniale della famiglia. La dote che la donna recava con sé al momento del matrimonio, e con la quale si contribuiva al sostegno degli onera matrimonii, vale a dire il sostentamento giornaliero della stessa famiglia, sarebbe dovuta essere “congrua”, e tale parametro di valutazione veniva calcolato ricorrendo a due coefficienti, quali la qualitas personarum e la quantitas patrimonii, ovvero, la posizione sociale della famiglia d’origine e della famiglia di destinazione e la consistenza del patrimonio paterno. [...] Ma al contrario, nella realtà, spesso la dote rappresentava una misera porzione del patrimonio di famiglia, il più delle volte caratterizzata da una presunta “inofficiosità”, oppure solamente promessa e mai consegnata, dal momento che per difendere il più possibile l’integrità del patrimonio paterno [...] si cercava di eludere l’obbligo di dotare le figlie, o, in alterativa, di contenerne al massimo il quantitativo; spesso finiva per diventare non solo un’anticipazione delle ragioni ereditarie della sposa, ma per costituire tout court la liquidazione di ogni sua pretesa ereditaria. [...] Le norme statutarie nascevano dall’esigenza di comprimere e limitare, per quanto possibile, i diritti di proprietà della donna allo scopo di riservare i patrimoni ai maschi della famiglia ai quali era affidato il mantenimento dell’onore e del decoro della famiglia stessa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_435_ItPapEM] "[T]he <i>pater</i> [father], in addition to being the undisputed head of the house, was in fact absolute <i>dominus</i> [master] of the family patrimony, which consisted of various assets, including the dowry, that is, the true pivot of the family's patrimonial structure.

In Byzantium, too, Christian writers used Biblical verses and the teachings of the early Church Fathers to argue for the inferiority of women and slaves [MAJIDBENAM_REF_487_ItPapEM].

Thinking on gender was rooted in the three religions of the time, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam; in scientific teachings; and in political traditions. Each constituted an authoritative literate discourse, and together they spoke about women and gender in a remarkably coherent chorus. Women were understood as less than men, female attributes as less good than male ones, and gender relations as properly characterized by womanly submission and manly governance. Theology had pride of place in these discussions not only because so much medieval learning was produced in religious contexts but also because religious inquiry then included almost all knowledge.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_490_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes people from different locations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of inequality ♣ absent ♥</b> Jesus' message "envisages a universal society bound together by divine love in which the limited human ties of affection based on kinship, cultural identity, and self-interest give way to the unlimited love of God.

[...] [Polygamy] was a violation not only of the natural form of marriage, but even more of the supernatural norm which it embodied. For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the rst was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage. It was tantamount to downing a beer and a sandwich and calling that the eucharist, or diving into a pond several times and calling that baptism writ large. This simply could not be. It was not only a “legal impossibility,” as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too. Medieval writers labeled such misuses of the concept and institution of marriage by Christians as “heresy,” “blasphemy,” and “desecration” - an insult to God and his sacraments.

Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms. It was taken for granted that the universe was designed in such a way that some of God’s creatures were intended to be at the topand some below them. Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality. Until late in the Middle Ages, few appear to have seen anything wrong with the idea that there should be rulers and ruled, for hierarchical arrangements of parts within wholes were a normal way of making an organism ‘work’. A body needs a head but it also needs feet (I Corinthians 12.20). In fragmentary survivals of the teaching which was given in the cathedral school at Laon at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries, there is a discussion of the passage in Ephesians 6.5 where servants are told to obey their masters. ‘It is no sin to have a servant or to be a servant.’ It was argued at Laon that there are two reasons why ‘servitude is given by God.’ It may be a punishment for the sins of those who are slaves or servants. Or it may have a purpose of proving or testing them, so that, humbled, they may be better people.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> From the eighth century to the Counter-reformation era, from Scandinavia to France to Italy, Christian penitentials regularly included instructions regarding the kinds of penance clergy should assign to those guilty of the following acts: homicide, perjury, sacrilege, drunkenness, various types of sexual transgressions (including adultery, incest, sodomy and bestiality), sorcery, respect for one's parents, and theft[MAJIDBENAM_REF_538_ItPapEM].

Since marriage was a sacrament, the church claimed exclusive jurisdiction over it, appropriating and expanding the laws of nature (Natural Law) and Scripture as well as some of the rules in the early church constitutions and Christianized Roman law. Comprehensive new laws, called canon laws, were promulgated by the papacy and the church councils and enforced by church courts throughout Western Christendom.//”Consistent with the naturalist perspective on marriage, the church’s canon law punished contraception, abortion, and child abuse as violations of the created functions of propagation and child rearing. It also proscribed unnatural sexual acts, such as sodomy and bestiality. Consistent with the contractual perspective, canon law ensured free consnsual unions by dissolving marriages contracted by mistake or under duress, fraud, or coercion. It also granted husband and wife equal rights to enforce conjugal debts that had been voluntarily assumed and emphasized the importance of mutual love among the couple, their children, and their parents.//”Consistent with the sacramental perspective canon law protcted the sanctity and sanctifying purpose of marriage by declaring valid marital bonds to be indissoluble and by annulling invalid unions between Christians and non-Christians or between parties related by various legal, spiritual, blood, or family ties. It supported celibacy by annulling unconsummated vows of marriage if one party made a vow of chastity and by prohibiting clerics on monastics from marriage and concubinage.//”Earlier Christianized Roman and Germanic laws governing the relationships between husband and wife, and parent and child, were liberally appropriated by the canonists and now enforced in the church courts as well as in the confessional (Confession of Sins). Traditional rules and customs of arranged marriages, patriarchal restrictions on the marital estate, male-dominated inheritance laws and primogeniture, protection of the status of the paterfamilias, and restrictions on the wife’s capacity to sue or be sued, to enter into contracts, to give or receive property of her own—all remained firmly in place in canon law.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_540_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> “On the individual level, Augustine counseled nonresistance, hence, nonviolence; he worried that inordinate desires even to preserve one’s own life could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could lead further to evil deeds. augustine knew well the horrors of war and the lusts that war itself incites. Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_541_ItPapEM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> From the eighth century to the Counter-reformation era, from Scandinavia to France to Italy, Christian penitentials regularly included instructions regarding the kinds of penance clergy should assign to those guilty of the following acts: homicide, perjury, sacrilege, drunkenness, various types of sexual transgressions (including adultery, incest, sodomy and bestiality), sorcery, respect for one's parents, and theft[MAJIDBENAM_REF_542_ItPapEM].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ present ♥</b> "Around the year 1000 therefore, when the Emperor Otto III visited Rome, Roman priests were familiar with penitential books and were using them in a pastoral setting."
