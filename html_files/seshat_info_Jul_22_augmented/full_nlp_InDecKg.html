Information relating to political organization within our region of interest--roughly corresponding to the Bellary district in the modern-day Indian state of Karnataka--is also lacking, though sources suggest the existence of monarchies and an accompanying bureaucratic apparatus (scribes and mints, for example) in neighbouring regions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=InDecKg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ ♥</b> in squared kilometers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b> People.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b> Inhabitants.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ ♥</b> in kilometers.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=InDecKg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Hierarchical Complexity">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [2-4] ♥</b> levels.

This may indicate that record-keeping started to play an integral part in local political administration as well as in commercial activities in this period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_InDecKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In Andhra region post-Mauryans: "Along with local kingships, inscriptions of this period mention other socio-political and socio-economic institutions, particularly as nigama and gothi. Although it is not possible to comprehend the precise nature of these institutions in this period of coastal Andhra, textual and epigraphic evidence indicates that a nigama was an imporant economic and social unit larger than a village (gama), and was composed of integrated members of kin groups and occupational or professional groups. A gothi (skt. gosthi), was another important economic and social institution particularly for urban elites. Bhattiprolu inscriptions also show that these urban institutions and local kings were closely connected, as the inscriptions describe the king Kuberaka as the chief (pamukha=skt. pramukha) of a nigama and a gothi. This seems to indicate that the kings in this period of Andhra were not absolute rulers with invincible powers, but were close to chiefdoms or, in Chattopadhyaya's word, 'localities' that derived possibly from the foundations of megalithic chiefs. These 'localities' seem to have consolidated their powers in close association with urban elites that also started appearing in this period."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InDecKg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The political and economic development in the post-Mauryan period progressed further under the Sadas, a regional dynasty which ruled the larger part of coastal Andhra for at least a century ... Although the historical evidence on this recently-found dynasty is still meagre, a few epigraphic records indicate the presence of a regular administrative structure indicated by titles such as an irrigation officer (?) (paniyagharika) and a scribe (lekhaka). There is also little doubt that the dynasty maintained royal coinage. Unlike the post-Mauryan coinage, which was basically uninscribed, the Sada coins were consistently inscribed with the ruler's name and kept the same design, a standing lion facing a tree ..."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Buddhist monasteries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ ♥</b> levels.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Professions">Professions</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=InDecKg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Professions">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Occupational complexity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional military officers ♣ ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional soldiers ♣ ♥</b> Full-time specialists</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Buddhist monasteries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InDecKg]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bureaucracy_characteristics">Bureaucracy characteristics</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=InDecKg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: Bureaucracy characteristics">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Full-time specialists[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Post-Mauryans in Krishna valley: "Amaravati inscription of this period records the existence of a royal scribe (rajalekhaka).

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_120_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_121_InDecKg] “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_122_InDecKg] Jainism: “The ethos of storing up merit leads to all manner of positive charitable activities, for which the Jain community is justifiably famous. But all such activities are ultimately in the service of spiritual liberation. To give, for a Jain layperson, is actually a mentally purifying act - a mini-renunciation - in preparation for the ultimate renunciation for which the layperson hopes eventually to be ready - if not in this life, then in a future rebirth.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_InDecKg] Asoka’s edicts: “There is no higher duty then the welfare of the whole world. And what little effort I make is in order that I may be free from debt to the creatures, that  I may render them happy here and they may gain heaven in the next world.”’... The new ideas of social and moral ethics which Asoka infused into Buddhism were in keeping with his idea of adapting a new religion to contemporary needs during a period of political and economic transition. Instead of appealing to the narrow sectarian religious interests, he stressed the conscious aplication of pristine virtues of humanitarianism in social behaviour. In the complex cultural milieu of the third century B.C., Asoka inculcated the true meaning of Dhamma - man’s responsibility to his fellow human beings.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> “Living a morally good life thus always brings a twofold benefit: Others are aided and one’s own spiritual development or karmic disposition is positively affected. This point is captured in one of the central Buddhist virtues: dana, which is ‘giving’ or ‘generosity’. ‘Giving’ creates a win-win situation. Not only is the gift’s recipient benefited but also the gift’s donor - particularly from a Buddhist point of view, since through giving one counters attachment in its deep-seated form of greedy grasping, of not letting-go.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_InDecKg] Jainism: “The ethos of storing up merit leads to all manner of positive charitable activities, for which the Jain community is justifiably famous. But all such activities are ultimately in the service of spiritual liberation. To give, for a Jain layperson, is actually a mentally purifying act - a mini-renunciation - in preparation for the ultimate renunciation for which the layperson hopes eventually to be ready - if not in this life, then in a future rebirth.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_126_InDecKg] Asoka’s edicts: ‘In Rock Edict III, he [Asoka] enjoins obedience to mother and father, generosity toward priests and ascetics, and frugality in spending.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> Buddhism generally: “Leading a moral life is seen as having a wider social dimension as well. Establishing public parks, constructing bridges, digging wells and providing a residence for the homeless (see SN 1:1:47; similarly Jat 31) - all these are commended.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_InDecKg] Kautilya’s Arthashastra: ‘The king shall provide the orphans, (bala), the aged, the infirm, the afflicted, and the helpless with maintenance.

Morality is an intrinsic part of the path to salvation because it is part and parcel of the salvific process of overcoming ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_132_InDecKg] Jainism: “Like Hindus and Buddhists, Jains affirm the reality of a universal moral principle of cause and effect called karma. Derived from a Sanskrit word meaning ‘act’, karma governs all action. It can be likened to Newton’s Third Law of Motion: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. But traditional Indic worldviews do not make the sharp distinction, so typical of modern Western thought, between the realms of fact and value. Karma thus manifests not only in the form of physical laws, such as gravity, but also as a moral law governing action. If one engages in actions that are violent, or motivated by hatred, selfishness, or egotism, the universe will respond in kind, producing suffering in the one who has caused suffering to others. Similarly, if one engages in actions that are benevolent, pure, and kind, the universe will respond benevolently, and one will have pleasant experiences.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_133_InDecKg] Asoka’s edicts: ‘In Rock Edict IX Asoka denounces the practice of many orthodox ceremonies and maintains that the practice of morality is far more important than the observance of rituals.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_134_InDecKg]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Slavery">Normative Ideological Aspects of Slavery</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=InDecKg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=68" title="Edit section: Normative Ideological Aspects of Slavery">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery for co-ethnics ♣ absent ♥</b> Asohka produced injunctions to treat slaves well; but slavery was practiced [MAJIDBENAM_REF_135_InDecKg]  “Very humane are the rules for the treatment of one’s servants: ‘arranging their work according to their strength, … supplying them with food and wages, … looking after them when they are ill, … sharing special delicacies with them, and … letting them off work at the right time.’ Conversely, servants and workpeople should be diligent, not betray their masters or steal from them, and care for their good reputation.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_136_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery for co-religionists ♣ absent ♥</b> Asohka produced injunctions to treat slaves well; but slavery was practiced [MAJIDBENAM_REF_137_InDecKg] “Very humane are the rules for the treatment of one’s servants: ‘arranging their work according to their strength, … supplying them with food and wages, … looking after them when they are ill, … sharing special delicacies with them, and … letting them off work at the right time.’ Conversely, servants and workpeople should be diligent, not betray their masters or steal from them, and care for their good reputation.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_138_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ absent ♥</b>  Asohka produced injunctions to treat slaves well; but slavery was practiced [MAJIDBENAM_REF_139_InDecKg]  “Very humane are the rules for the treatment of one’s servants: ‘arranging their work according to their strength, … supplying them with food and wages, … looking after them when they are ill, … sharing special delicacies with them, and … letting them off work at the right time.’ Conversely, servants and workpeople should be diligent, not betray their masters or steal from them, and care for their good reputation.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_140_InDecKg]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Human_Sacrifice">Normative Ideological Aspects of Human Sacrifice</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=InDecKg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=69" title="Edit section: Normative Ideological Aspects of Human Sacrifice">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 0 ♥</b> Buddhism: “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ (karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome (kusla/kusala) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dana), ethical conduct (sila/sila), and meditation (bhavana). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_179_InDecKg] “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action (karma/kamma-patha) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action- strong greed, hatred, and delusion -lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_180_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of fairness ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (punna, Sanskrit: punya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital-like money in a bank account-whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_181_InDecKg]  “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action (karma/kamma-patha) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigalovada Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsaric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_190_InDecKg] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_191_InDecKg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended.
