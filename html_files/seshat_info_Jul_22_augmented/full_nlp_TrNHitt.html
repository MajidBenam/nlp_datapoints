whose rulers became tributaries of Assyria." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Neo-Hittite period can be divided into two main phases, as suggested by Mazzoni ([1995] 189). The first phase covers the period from the 12th century to the mid 9th century B.C. This period is characterised by the rise of kingdoms each centred on a town. Some of these towns were new foundations, but some were refoundations of earlier urban centres now embellished with monumental iconography. The second period covers the ca. 150 years from the mid 9th century to the Assyrian conquest in the late 8th century B.C. This phase saw the growth of centres and also an increasing concern for security expressed in the building of fortified strongholds throughout the region."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrNHitt] "Carchemish and probably Malatya apparently continued from their Late Bronze Age predecessors with little or no interruption."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrNHitt]  Tabal region (Konya Plain): "There is nothing in the material record to indicate that it was significantly affected by the upheavals at the end of the Late Bronze Age, or by the collapse of the Hittite empire.

The population of the region was very likely a predominantly Luwian one, as it had been throughout the Late Bronze Age and perhaps already in the early second millennium."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrNHitt] "In the post-Bronze Age era, Hittite cuneiform disappeared entirely. There is not the slightest trace of it in any of the Iron Age successor-kingdoms of the Hittites.

The primary region of the Syro-Hittite kingdoms was however in Syria. The small states lasted for almost 500 years and were culturally and politically prominent from c900 BCE until the last of them fell to the Assyrian king Sargon II between 717-708 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrNHitt] The cultural links between these kingdoms and the Late Bronze Age Hittite Empire can be seen in the iconography and architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 1180-900 BCE post-Empire period the region reorganized into city-states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrNHitt] The earliest written records suggest there was no kind of federation, "each was entirely independent from the others, each had its own autonomous ruler."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrNHitt] The label 'Neo-Hittite' applies to 15 states spread through south-eastern Anatolia and northern Syria.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrNHitt] Those present in the area around or on the Konya Plain were the following: Pisidia; Pamphylia; Lycaonia; Tabal; Cilicia (Hilakku and Que).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although there was some continuity with the preceding period major cultural changes occurred in the Neo-Hittite era. According to Bryce (2012) "Hittite cuneiform disappeared entirely. There is not the slightest trace of it in any of the Iron Age successor-kingdoms of the Hittites. One might reasonably suppose that along with the disappearance of the written language, Nesite also disappeared as a spoken one."

Neo-Hittite state of 700 km2 * 44.4 density per km2 would provide an estimate of about 30,000.

When Anzapaḫḫadu refused a demand from Šuppiluliuma to return refugees from Hittite authority, Šuppiluliuma dispatched to the region an army led by his commander Ḫimuili to enforce his demand. The Hittite army was ambushed and destroyed, and Šuppiluliuma was obliged to take the field at the head of another expeditionary force to complete the mission (from the “Deeds of Šuppiluliuma,” trans. Harry A. Hoffner Jr. in Hallo and Younger 2003:vol. 1, 188). After his accession to the Hittite throne, he installed one of his ablest military commanders, Ḫannutti, as governor of the Lower Land, clearly intending this region to serve as a base for further military operations against Arzawan territories (Bryce 2005:151).'

The implication is that Milawata was considered a Hittite subject territory at that time and had broken its allegiance to Ḫatti. In the same year, the Arzawan king Uḫḫaziti was forced to flee Hittite authority, as we have noted, taking refuge on one of the offshore islands that were under the control of the Aḫḫiyawan king (see Beal, chapter 26 in this volume).

♥</b>Based on the following quotes, a certain degree of continuity has been assumed from the New Kingdom Hatti in terms of how kings could have modelled their power after their predecessors.  However, these inferences are speculative and need to be double-checked by experts. On the other hand, inferring continuity in the fields of central and local administration, or legal rights, would be far-fetched considering the lack of information and the difference in scale between the New Kingdom Hatti polity and the much smaller and disparate Neo-Hittite kingdoms.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"It is now time for us to begin our investigations of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms. ‘Neo-Hittite’ is a modern term, coined by scholars to refer to a group of states located in northern Syria and south-eastern Anatolia that arose, developed, and were finally absorbed into the Assyrian empire during the first four centuries of the Iron Age (mid 12th to late 8th century). The states so called displayed one or more of the following characteristics: [...] A number of inscriptions found at various sites within them are written in the Luwian hieroglyphic script and language. Luwian had (probably) become the predominant language of Anatolia in the last centuries of the Hittite empire. Its use by Late Bronze Age Hittite kings on their public monuments and seals provides an apparent link with later Iron Age kingdoms. The rulers of the kingdoms in question sometimes bore Luwian names, and sometimes the names, in Luwianized or Assyrianized form, of Late Bronze Age Hittite kings. There is material evidence of cultural links between these kingdoms and the Late Bronze Age Hittite kingdom, notably in their iconography and architecture."

"There can be no doubt that in the management of the affairs of the Land of Hatti the Hittite king’s role was very much a hands-on one. He was chief priest of his people, the gods’ deputy on earth, and each year he was the principal celebrant in a demanding round of religious festivals, which often took him on pilgrimages to the main religious centres of his kingdom. He was commander-in-chief of the Hittite armies, and regularly led his troops on campaigns far from the homeland." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_152_TrNHitt] There is a lack of information regarding political and administrative organisation in Neo-Hittite polities, and inferring continuity might be problematic.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ ♥</b> New Kingdom Hatti kings also took part in legislation. "Hattusili’s interest in preserving a memory of the past and in recording current events for posterity suggests that he was an intelligent and complex ruler. He also formulated the Hittite law code and established the pankus “assembly,” an ad hoc judicial body composed of members of the state bureaucracy whose role was to witness and enforce agreements and royal proclamations and to try criminal offenders of particularly high status." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_153_TrNHitt] There is a lack of information regarding political and administrative organisation in Neo-Hittite polities, and inferring continuity might be problematic.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ ♥</b> New Kingdom Hatti kings were also the heads of the judicial system. "He deputized for the Sun God as the supreme earthly judge of his people, and personally sat in judgement on disputes between vassal rulers, on cases which could only be tried by the king’s court, and on appeals against judgements made by a lower court. Encapsulated in these duties is the classic threefold functions of kingship in the Near East, as well as in Homeric society, which combines the king’s religious, military, and judicial roles. " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_154_TrNHitt] There is a lack of information regarding political and administrative organisation in Neo-Hittite polities, and inferring continuity might be problematic.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Right to petition executive ♣ ♥</b> This right was present in New Kingdom Hatti, but there is not enough information on the Neo-Hittites to infer continuity. "Our knowledge of Hittite law and its application is based on a range of sources. These include minutes of court proceedings which record the testimony of the participants involved in litigation (for example, defendants accused of theft or of having misappropriated certain items placed in their charge),6 instructions issued by the king to provincial administrators who have been assigned judicial responsibilities in their regions, records of cases arising from disputes in and between vassal states, especially in Syria where they were generally dealt with by one of the king’s representatives in the region (often the viceroy), and an occasional reference to court cases in the home-and, like the lawsuits involving the prince Hattusili (later King Hattusili III) and his rival and distant relative Arma-Tarhunda. We might also include in our list of sources the collection of anecdotes from the so-called Palace Chronicle, dating back to the reigns of Hattusili I and Mursili I, which record various offences committed by palace officials, and the penalties for these offences.7" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_155_TrNHitt]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Critique of executive by government ♣ ♥</b> Critiques of the executive were not tolerated under the New Kingdom Hatti. However, the Neo-Hittite kingdoms may have had different legal freedoms.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_164_TrNHitt] , then we can infer that witchcraft was still a powerful accusation.  "It was a charge of witchcraft that led to the downfall of Arma- Tarhunda, governor of the strategically important Upper Land during the reign of King Muwatalli (II). As we have noted, Arma- Tarhunda was related to the royal family, and had the misfortune to be the arch-rival of the king’s brother Hattusili, later to occupy the throne as Hattusili III. Prior to this Muwatalli had made his brother governor of the Upper Land in place of Arma-Tarhunda, much to the latter’s fury. It was Hattusili who had brought the charge of witchcraft, to counter an indictment which Arma-Tarhunda had brought against him:‘Furthermore he and his wife and his son began to bewitch me. He also filled Samuha, the city of the deity, with witch- craft.’65 One cannot help suspecting that Arma-Tarhunda’s charge (whatever it may have been) was not unjustified, and Hattusili's a trumped-up one; it was certainly well within the capability of the wily and ruthlessly ambitious young prince to resort to such measures to rid himself of an inconvenient rival. In any case Muwatalli found against the defendant, and handed him over to Hattusili for punishment, thus ensuring the removal of one of the chief obstacles in his brother’s career path. Yet Hattusili’s treatment of Arma-Tarhunda was surprisingly mild: he let him go free and returned to him half his confiscated property; subsequently he attempted a reconciliation with his family. All this, he claims, he did out of pity, for Arma- Tarhunda was now an old man. More likely he was acting out of remorse—for a charge unjustly laid.The mere allegation of witchcraft may well have generated concerns and emotions which were almost sufficient in themselves to secure a conviction. To judge from the Proclamation of King Telipinu, even a knowledge of the black arts rendered one liable to prosecution. And persons who knew of but failed to denounce those suspected of having such knowledge were themselves liable to punishment: ‘In Hattusa hereafter sorcery must be exorcized. Whoever in the (royal) family knows about sorcery, you must seize him and bring him to the gate of the palace. Whoever does not bring him here—it will come about that things will go badly for this man and his house.’66" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_165_TrNHitt]?</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ ♥</b> If we infer continuity from the New Kingdom Hatti based on the following quote: "They are commonly referred to as the Neo-Hittite kingdoms, since they preserved a number of Hittite cultural traditions, including elements of Hittite religion, architecture and iconography."

"Suppiluliuma recorded his Alasiya campaign on the Eternal Peak, the mortuary shrine at Nişantaş that he dedicated to his father in Hattusa. That Suppiluliuma II appears to have directed much of his energy to the construction of such religious monuments has been taken as an indication of his growing desperation, as he appealed to the gods and the manes of the ancestors for assistance." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_177_TrNHitt][MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ inferred present ♥</b> In Hatti:  "We must assume that the king’s choice of successor, within the parameters laid down by Telipinu,17 had the benefit of divine guidance, or that he at least ensured, through divination or other means, that his choice was acceptable to his divine masters. Some scholars believe that the king may originally have been elected by the nobility. But even if this were so, the principle of hereditary succession had been firmly established by the time of Hattusili I, the king with whom our earliest written records are associated. By implication, this principle also had divine endorsement, since the gods’ appointee was invariably a member of his predecessor’s immediate family." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_178_TrNHitt] There is no information on whether Neo-Hittite kings followed the New Kingdom Hatti principle of hereditary succession, but it seems likely considering that many of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms harked back to this former polity. "It is now time for us to begin our investigations of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms. ‘Neo-Hittite’ is a modern term, coined by scholars to refer to a group of states located in northern Syria and south-eastern Anatolia that arose, developed, and were finally absorbed into the Assyrian empire during the first four centuries of the Iron Age (mid 12th to late 8th century). The states so called displayed one or more of the following characteristics: [...] A number of inscriptions found at various sites within them are written in the Luwian hieroglyphic script and language. Luwian had (probably) become the predominant language of Anatolia in the last centuries of the Hittite empire. Its use by Late Bronze Age Hittite kings on their public monuments and seals provides an apparent link with later Iron Age kingdoms. The rulers of the kingdoms in question sometimes bore Luwian names, and sometimes the names, in Luwianized or Assyrianized form, of Late Bronze Age Hittite kings.

A liturgy might be recited and incense burned. The animal was brought in, sometimes with great fanfare. only top-quality items could be given to the deity. The substitution of a scrawny animal for a healthy one left the offerant vulnerable to divine retribution. The procession could include singers and musicians as well as other participants in the ritual, such as the cook. The moment of slaughter, for which a special knife was used, was one of jubilation. The animal was then butchered and the deity given the roasted heart and liver. The cook used the remainder of the animal to make a stew to be shared by the participants. The food was set out, libations poured, and the feasting began. At this point the king might “drink the god,” that is, toast him, a practice unique to the Hittites. Ceremonies of this kind correspond most closely to what are termed “fellowship” offerings (selamim) in the Hebrew Bible, the primary purpose of which was the communal meal with the deity.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_254_TrNHitt]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ morality ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "They are commonly referred to as the Neo-Hittite kingdoms, since they preserved a number of Hittite cultural traditions, including elements of Hittite religion, architecture and iconography."

This relationship is expressed officially in the imagery of the shepherd protecting his flock: 'May the land of Hatti graze abundantly (?) in the hand of the labarna (i.e., the king) and tawananna (i.e., the queen), and may it expand!' In reality, however, outside of his family and principal advisors, the king probably had almost no contact with the people he ruled, living instead an isolated existence designed in part to preserve his life and in part to protect him from pollution. As priest of the gods, the king’s purity was a matter of considerable concern, and the lives of those whose carelessness jeopardized his higher state were forfeit. One cannot help but wonder what the average farmer or coppersmith privately thought of this remote figure.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_321_TrNHitt]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "They are commonly referred to as the Neo-Hittite kingdoms, since they preserved a number of Hittite cultural traditions, including elements of Hittite religion, architecture and iconography."
