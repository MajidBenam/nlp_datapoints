Vowing never again to allow a single person to amass so much authority, the revolutionaries established in place of the monarchy a republican system of governance, featuring a senate composed of aristocratic men and a series of elected political and military officials. The Roman Republic was a remarkably stable and successful polity, lasting from 509 BCE until it was transformed into an imperial state under Augustus in 31 BCE (though the exact date is debated, as this was not a formal transformation). We divide the Republic into an early (509-264 BCE), a middle (264-133 BCE), and a late (133-31 BCE) period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the 3rd century BCE, Rome fought two separate wars (264-241 BCE and 218-201 BCE) against the Punic people, inhabitants of a former Phoenician colony in North Africa, Sicily, and southern Spain. The latter conflict featured a bitter contest against the famous Punic general Hannibal, who nearly defeated the Romans on his dramatic march through Italy from 218 to 216 BCE. However, Rome recovered, won control of Punic holdings in Sicily and Spain, and established what were essentially vassal kingdoms in North Africa. In the early 2nd century BCE, Rome became embroiled in another series of wars in Greece, Macedonia, and Anatolia. The 3rd and 2nd centuries were a somewhat chaotic time in the eastern Mediterranean, following the fragmentation of Alexander the Great's Macedonian Empire after his death in 323 BCE. Alexander's Empire had essentially dissolved into a series of successor states, which engaged in near-constant warfare in their attempts to expand at the others' expense.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_ItRomMR] By 148 BCE, at the conclusion of the fourth and final Macedonian War, Rome was either in possession of or was firmly established as hegemon over the entire Mediterranean basin, from Spain in the west to Anatolia in the east, and France in the north to Libya and Egypt in the south. This position brought new territory along with a flood of new peoples, culture, and wealth from the ancient civilizations in Greece, Egypt, and Anatolia. By the end of the Middle Republic period, Rome was virtually unchallenged by external enemies, although this newfound wealth and power was accompanied by the period of internal turmoil that characterized the Late Republic.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Rome during the Republican period possessed no written constitution, but was governed largely through the power and prestige of the Senate, with a clear respect for precedent and for maintaining Rome's traditions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_ItRomMR] A primary goal of the early Republic was to establish clear checks on the power of any single ruler - the military office of chief commander was in fact split between two generals (consuls), while the chief priestly and legislative posts were split among different people (individuals were restricted from holding multiple offices at once) - and popular assemblies voted on new laws.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Romans of this period did not distinguish between what is today termed 'secular' and 'sacred' authority; although individual magistracies had distinct functions, the same person often held both religious and political offices over the course of their lifetime, as they were thought to be part of essentially the same sphere of governance. The Republic featured a substantial array of religious offices and institutions intended to determine the will of the gods or to please them through the proper performance of rituals and the maintenance of large public temples.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_ItRomMR] These public auspices were the basis of magisterial power in the Republic.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ItRomMR] Auspices were sometimes taken by consuls and other officials, for example before important military engagements,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItRomMR] but were mainly managed by specialist elected priests and full-time priestesses (such as the Vestal Virgins) and other priestly offices supported by the state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Middle Roman Republic saw many firsts in Rome's economic development. The first paved road was the likely the military road to Capua known as the Appian Way, commissioned around 312 BCE. The first Roman coins (large cast bronze coins) appear around 270 BCE, followed by struck bronze and silver coins imitating Greek forms.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItRomMR]​​​​ This period also saw a further population increase in the total population of Roman-controlled Italy to between about three and five million people, with Rome itself likely supporting over 200,000 people by the end of the 3rd century BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItRomMR]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Roman Republic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Roman_Republic_200BCE: 264BCE-133BCE ♥</b>  Roman_Republic_200BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItRomMR]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  367142: 264BCE-133BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Italic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Latin ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Ancient Roman Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Sect ♣ Ancient Greek Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Ancient Anatolian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>This polity was coded early, was the target of dedicated workshops, and had many experts look over it.

Modern scholars who have discussed the issue attempted to construct as complete a picture as possible from the extant data, and the following account is based largely on their reconstructions and conclusions whose outlines are generally accepted. We shall first review the features common to all electoral assemblies, and then examine the distinctive procedures of each one in turn. "[...] "As in all public activities, it was important to assure that the gods looked upon the elections favorably. Therefore, between midnight and dawn of the elections day, the presiding magistrate (a consul or a dictator who had the right to ask for signs (auspicia), which was part of their imperium) arrived at the voting venue. He established a holy compound (templum) at the site, ascended a raised podium and scanned the skies for signs that the gods looked favorably upon the assembly. These he interpreted with the help of one of the augures. If the signs were inauspicious, the elections were postponed to an alternative assembly day that probably had been reserved ahead for this purpose. [...]. "Since all public activity in Rome ceased at sundown, the magistrate called on citizens to start voting immediately at dawn. The summons, like other instructions to voters, was delivered in a prescribed manner. A herald stood on a podium and declared the start of the elections, while another blew a trumpet around the city walls and called on the citizens to vote. While the voting for the centuriate assembly was in session, a red flag was hoisted on the Ianiculum, the hill across the Tiber, facing the election zone at the campus Martius, to indicate that the city was not in danger of an enemy attack (p.96). "Once all ceremonies had been completed, the magistrate, who was seated on an elevated tribunal outside the saepta, delivered a public prayer in time-honored fashion, beseeching the immortal gods for their blessing and expressing the hope that their good-will would enable the elections to proceed and bring success and prosperity to the elected and to the Roman people in general. He then formally appealed to the assembled citizens to declare which among the candidates they wished to elect to the respective positions. Up to this point, the sequence of events was in fact an unofficial assembly (contio). However, once the presiding magistrate ordered the citizens to split up, report to their respective units (discedite Quirites) and vote (ite ad suffragium)- irrespective of the number of citizens who showed up to vote - the gathering changed from an unofficial assembly to an official one (comitia). "At this point, each voter reported to the place assigned to his tribe in the saepta. It is unclear precisely how and where citizens assembled before the vote, how they identified themselves to the tribal officials (tribules), or how the latter verified the voters’ identities to prevent fraud - perhaps it was based on personal acquaintance, or by consulting a list of tribe members. Nicolet speculated that each Roman citizen was issued with a small bronze “dog tag” stating his name and tribe, but there is no evidence whatsoever to confirm his conjecture. "Before 139, voting was oral. Each voter presented himself before a rogator (p. 129) and stated his choice aloud. The rogator noted this with a point (puncta) on a wax tablet assigned to each of the official candidates, and when the voting was over, each candidate’s points were added up. However, from 139 onwards, Romans elected their magistrates by inscribing the initials of the name(s) of the candidate(s) of their choice on small wax tablets. Precisely when and where each voter received his tablet, or inscribed his choices, remains unknown. Apparently, there was no supervision over the voters during the inscription on the tablets, judging by an incident when Cato the Younger annulled the elections results after proving that 'all the votes bore the same handwriting.' [...] "Having inscribed the names of the chosen candidates on the tablet, each voter joined his tribe’s designated lineup and ascended a raised podium (usually of a temple between six and ten feet high or a specially constructed platform) by the means of a flight of stairs and a wooden bridge (pons). We do not know if there were thirty-five bridges for this purpose - one for each tribe - or a smaller number shared among the tribes. In 119, Marius, as tribune of the plebs, enacted a law that ordered these bridges to be narrowed. Some modern scholars believe that this was designed to make it more difficult for hawkers to sway voters in favor of one candidate or another at the very last minute, but this interpretation is problematic for a number of reasons. First, Plutarch explicitly states that Marius asked to narrow the bridges in connection with voting in the law courts (p.131), not during elections; second, this notion is based on the assumption that voters inscribed the names of the candidates on their tablets only immediately before casting their vote. However, this is inconsistent with other testimonies - such as the aforementioned fraud exposed by Cato the Younger - and with current estimates of the comparative brevity of the elections process, as will presently become clear. Therefore, it cannot be unequivocally established that Marius’ law was applied to elections as well. "On the podium itself stood a large urn (cista) by way of a ballot box (one for each tribe), into which each voter cast his marked wax tablet. It was surrounded by guardians (custodes) appointed by the presiding magistrate from among the tribal dignitaries, as well as by representatives of the vari- ous candidates, whose job was to supervise the voting and to ensure that no voter cast more than a single tablet into the cista. Once voting was over, the tablets were removed from each of the tribal urns, inspected by the “ballot committee,” and the votes noted on other wax tablets with points, just as in the days when voting was conducted orally. Many people were involved in the counting (diribitio), and upon completion, the guardians formally handed over the results to the magistrate who presided over the assembly. "This procedure applied to both the centuriate and tribal assemblies; however, each of the popular assemblies had its own unique features. We will start with the tribal assemblies. "In the days when the tribal assemblies (the concilium plebis and the comitia tributa) voted at different venues in the narrow confines of the Forum, the tribes were called to vote in sequence (p.97), with the first tribe chosen by casting lots among the thirty-one rural tribes (the urban tribes were most probably excluded from this process). Thereafter the remaining tribes voted. Once the elections were moved to the much larger campus Martius, there was no longer any need for casting lots, as all tribes now voted simultaneously. "At the signal given by the presiding magistrate (a plebeian tribune or a consul), the citizens split into designated lines according to their respective tribes, apparently in a space outside the saepta. Once a voter’s identity had been verified by the tribal officials (tribules), he received a wax tablet and inscribed upon it the name or names of his preferred candidates (precisely how and where we do not know). To help the voters, the names of the candidates were noted in big characters on large tables. Although we know nothing about the order of voting within each tribe, it is reasonable to assume that the tribal notables such as senators and equites voted first. As the single file made its way up the pons to the elevated podium each voter cast his tablet into the tribal cista, and left the podium, apparently by means of one or more flights of stairs (either temporary ones or those of a temple) at the rear. "Once all tribes had cast their votes, the vote counting (diribitio) began in the presence of the guardians and the candidates’ representatives. Although the tribes voted simultaneously, the results from each tribe were announced separately, in an order determined by casting lots. This went on until a candidate had achieved the required majority (eighteen tribes i.e., eighteen electoral units out of thirty-five)."

"Lily Ross Taylor, who contributed greatly to our knowledge on Roman popular assemblies, estimated that the permanent structure was capable of holding up to 70,000 voters. Her critics, who also took into account the areas required for the inner spaces, the voting podiums and their approaches, and the vote counting area, have postulated lower figures. MacMullen put the saepta’s capacity at around 55,000 people, while Mouritsen calculated that the structure could hold no more than 30,000 people at a pinch. However, as we have said, mere capacity is not necessarily an indicator of actual attendance. Nicolet has reached an even lower figure, based on a single Ciceronian passage (Fam. 7.30), which attests that in 45, the consular elections (in which only one consul was elected) lasted five hours in all. Taking the entire process into account - including the time needed for each participant to vote, the vote count- ing, and the announcement of winners - he estimated that the number of voters of the eighteen centuriae of equites and the first and second classes - whose votes sufficed to determine the outcome - was 16,800.36 Mouritsen claims, however, that even this figure is overestimated, as Nicolet did not take into account the various organizational problems that took time away from the voting itself, and overlooked the fact that five Roman hours are the equivalent of three hours and forty-five minutes. Mouritsen therefore estimated that in the specific case of these rather extraordinary elections (the assembly had originally convened to elect quaestors), which took place under Caesar’s dictatorship, the number of participants of the first classis, the eighteen centuries of equites and the second classis numbered around six thousand men. All these conclusions are, of course, conjectural, but practically everything points to the fact that a very small percentage of the people participated in the elections."

The names of women and children were not included in the census, but fathers gave details about families. On the basis of the information received the censors registered citizens in tribes, tribus (by domicile, except in the case of freedmen who were, for most of the republic, registered in one or more of the four urban tribes), and centuries (see centuria) (by property and age). Those whose property did not qualify them for enrolment in one of the five classes were registered in a single century of capite censi (‘counted by head’; see Proletarii). The taking of a census was concluded with a religious ceremony of purification, the lustrum (lustration)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_241_ItRomMR].

However, starting from the rule of Augustus onwards, they became dynastic events, "used either to showcase [the Emperor's] chosen heirs [...] or to celebrate the beginning of reigns, almost as a coronation ritual" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_317_ItRomMR]. During the Principate and the Dominate eras, moreover, triumphs were much rarer, sometimes with decades passing between successive ones. But, besides this, the way they were celebrated during the Empire seems to have been broadly similar to how they were celebrated during the Republic. The procession started from outside the city, then proceeded through Rome's streets, passed through the triumphal gate, and ended at the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, where the Emperor, or a relative of his, dedicated a sacrifice to the god. Triumphs were grand affairs, involving feasts, and, in case of triumphs that were more military than dynastic, the display of prisoners of war, as well as precious items and natural wonders looted from the conquered territories. Usually they lasted one day, but there were exceptions.

magestracies e.g. praetors and tribunes) then these two individuals, as commanders of the army, did possess military power. This power was restricted, however, by the comitia centuriata which voted on decisions of war and peace; and the Senate which dealt with foreign relations. The consuls had the power to appoint a single dictator for a six-month period but this dictator was tasked with using his sweeping powers to resolve a specific crisis and was not allowed to threaten the state. The extent to which the Roman executive had military power might be considered to depend on the circumstances and the personalities involved. In theory there were checks to ensure military commanders were under citizen control, but in practice the military commanders often set the agenda such as the opportunities that arose through conquests or the imminent threats to the state.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> Senators, inc. consules, voted on and made legislation. Although increasingly decisions put to popular vote as well. "During the republic male citizens could vote on legislation and in the selection of government officials. Voting was done in popular assemblies, of which every [Roman] citizen was a member, and was oral and public until 139 BCE, when secret ballots were introduced."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_426_ItRomMR] All four assemblies (comitia) were held outdoors; they were called: comitia curiata; comitia centuriata; comitia tributa; concilium plebis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_427_ItRomMR] "Legislation was initiated by a magistrate and discussed by the Senate, and was taken to one of the assemblies only for a vote. The senators therefore controlled the nature of the legislation that reached the assemblies. Laws or motions passed by the comitia were known as leges (sing. lex), and those by the concilium plebis were called plebiscita (sing. plebiscitum) (decrees of the plebeians). There was no opportunity for discussion during the assemblies, but very often informal public discussions were held - contiones (sing. contio) - before a vote was taken, which male citizens, women, slaves and foreigners could attend."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_428_ItRomMR] <i>Comitia curiata:</i> represented the three aristocratic tribes and "conferred imperium on consuls and praetors" but had no legislative powers.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_429_ItRomMR] <i>Comitia tributa:</i> voters divded into 35 tribes they represented. "It could be summoned by consuls, praetors or tribunes. It elected lesser magistrates and acted as a court of appeal in cases not involving capital punishment. This assembly was also a legislative body and voted on bills put before it by the presiding magistrate."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_430_ItRomMR] <i>Concilium plebis:</i> met at the Forum of Rome, consisted only of plebeians, divided into 35 tribes. "It may have elected tribunes and plebeian aediles. After 287 BC its resolutions (plebiscita) were binding on all citizens."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_431_ItRomMR] <i>Comitia centuriata:</i> "This centuriate assembly could be summoned only by a magistrate with imperium."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_432_ItRomMR] "Voters were divided into voting units called centuries ... based on men's age and their property values ... The poor had fewer votes ... This assembly decided between war and peace and elected higher magistrates. It also acted as a court of appeal against the death sentence in criminal cases. In the early republic it was the main legislative and judicial body, but its functions declined."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_433_ItRomMR] "The Senate was a group of unelected men called senators, restricted to patricians in the early republic but later extended to plebeians. In the middle and late republic a man was automatically admitted to the Senate for life once he had been elected by the comitia or concilium to his first magistracy. He was expelled only if found guilty of misconduct."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_434_ItRomMR] Formally the Senate advised magistrates but its "influence and power" grew, especially after the Second Punic War.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_435_ItRomMR] The Senate "prepared legislation to be put before the assemblies, administered finances, dealt with foreign relations and supervised state religion. In the 2nd and 1st centuries BC the Senate was the virtual government of Rome ... It could not make laws but issued decrees ...

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_440_ItRomMR] Before this time there were no judges as a distinct profession in the Roman system of law. Local magistrates dealt with local matters, provincial governors dealt with provincial matters, and the praetors often dealt with cases in Rome.

No court existed in which they could prosecute a Roman official: they sought redress from the Senate as the effective directors of Roman foreign policy, and only arraigned the conduct of the proconsuls in order to justify their claims. ... When the petition of the Sicilians was heard in the Senate, the Fathers agreed to commend the Scicilians (that is, Syracuse) to the favourable attention of Laevinus, but in general approved the acta of Marcellus. ...

Even the dictatorship, the least collegiate of all Roman offices, is both inextricable from the office of the magister equitum, and circumscribed by various restrictions. The praetorship after 367 would stand out here, although not if regarded as inextricably linked with the consulship."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_453_ItRomMR] After 494 BCE "the powers of the plebeian tribunes would encroach further on the consuls' exercise of imperium.

Romans considered infrastructure dedicated to reading omens and interpreting divine will necessary because every major action of the Roman state had to be legitimated by a reading of the public auspices (the signs of Jupiter).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_470_ItRomMR] From c300 BCE "Although the pontiffs continued to be extremely important as expert interpreters of the law, both before and after the passage of the Ogulnian Law, Cn. Flavius's actions [publication of the legis actiones and the legal calendar] simply removed any lingering pretense that the patrician college of pontiffs exercised a monopolistic control of the civil law. Like the increase in number of priests responsible for consulting the Sibylline Books in 368 B.C., this augmentation resulted from the fact that in Roman aristocratic culture these prominent priesthoods were viewed as being akin to public magistracies and as bestowing similar status and prestige. Roman society was becoming increasingly secularized, Roman religion was coming more and more under the influence of Greek culture, and these two trends were seriously eroding the traditional patrician claim to special expert religious knowledge. High-ranking plebeians, who were peers of the most prominent patricians in every other way, were eager to become members of these exclusive religious clubs and thereby to top off their public careers with the added distinction of a priestly office."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_471_ItRomMR] Public auspices ritual "entailed the competence to request, observe, and announce Jupiter's signs regarding an important act and then to complete what was intended.

They "were always patrician until 367 BC, when plebeians could stand for office"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_481_ItRomMR] and could appoint a single dictator for a six-month period for times of crisis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_482_ItRomMR] Consuls always acted in collaboration with the senate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_483_ItRomMR] For Roman law-making the voting assembly comitia centuriata was the "main legislative body [which] passed laws (leges) named after the magistrates who proposed them. After 287 BC the people controlled legislation with their resolutions (plebiscita). The comitia centuriata rarely legislated after 218 BC."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_484_ItRomMR]; additionally, "edicts of magistrates with imperium and interpretations of jurists ... had the force of law", whilst "Senatorial decrees (senatus consulta ...)... were strictly only advice to magistrates but were generally binding"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_485_ItRomMR]. "As Rome expanded, more magistrates were needed, and the consuls lost some of their original functions to other magistrates."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_486_ItRomMR] From the 318 BCE plebiscitum Ovinium, censors, two magesteries elected by the comitia centuriata who had "especially important sacral and civic duties",[MAJIDBENAM_REF_487_ItRomMR] replaced the two consuls as the individuals with the authority to appoint and remove senators, and they also appointed new consuls as senators. The Roman magesteries reflect both the aristocratic nature of Roman political organization which could permit powerful individuals but did not enable a single individual to dominate Roman society: "The term of office for magistrates was one year, and a senator would expect to be elected to at least two or three magistracies during his lifetime. A magistrate could hold other offices simultaneously, such as a priesthood."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_488_ItRomMR] It is speculated that the three ruling tribes or families (patricians) that ruled the Roman commoners (plebeians) during the regal period, before the tyranny, may have again had political significance during the historically murkier 509-367 BCE period; in that the aristocratic rulers may have wished to create a political system whereby one family could never dominate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_489_ItRomMR] In the consulship "no two individuals of the same gens ever held office contemporaneously" but in the brief consular tribunate "there [were] instances of the same gens holding more than one office."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_490_ItRomMR] "There is, in other words, no instance where one gens was able to dominate in any year, and we know that laws were passed later in the republic to insist on distribution of office in the priesthood on exactly these grounds."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_491_ItRomMR] In this respect, perhaps, it may be interesting that the Roman Republic had no independent central bureaucracy; it was not until the empire period that revenues were diverted into an imperial treasury[MAJIDBENAM_REF_492_ItRomMR]. The state treasury - cash and Senate archives - was in fact under the custody of a powerful priesthood inside the temple of Saturn controlled by elected officials called quaestors[MAJIDBENAM_REF_493_ItRomMR]. The Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the college of pontifices, was also an elected position - elected by the comitia tributa (assembly of all citizens). The pontifice lead the state cult and had to "maintain the pax deorum, the 'peace with the gods'"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_494_ItRomMR]. The location of the Roman treasury was thus a symbolic keystone for the Roman Republic because the all-important public auspices rituals "formed the basis of regal and then, in the Republic, magisterial power"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_495_ItRomMR]; in theory held by the executive and first consuls from 509 CE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_496_ItRomMR] in practice managed by specialist elected priests and full-time priestesses (Vestals, supported by the state and "full-time professional clergy, along with the priestess of Ceres and Proserpina"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_497_ItRomMR]) and an array of religious institutions that determined what the Roman gods wanted (e.g. college of augurs) and attempted to pleased them through ritual sacrifices and maintainence of their temples (e.g. vestals and flamines). Religious offices (duum viri) also were dedicated to interpreting sacred texts known as the Libri Sibyllini that the Romans considered prophetic (retained from the regal period). Romans considered infrastructure dedicated to reading omens and interpreting divine will necessary because every major action of the Roman state had to be legitimated by a reading of the public auspices (the signs of Jupiter).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_498_ItRomMR]. This gave the Roman priesthood an important influence over Roman society. Until Lex Ogulnia (300 BCE) all pontifices were patricians.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_499_ItRomMR] However, the direct role of the priesthood in the affairs of Roman society gradually declined through the 509-264 BCE period: the priests "originally interpreted civil law, ... this role was taken over by jurists (mainly of senatorial rank), and praetors [who] administered the law and issued edicts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_500_ItRomMR] The famous Twelve Tables of 451-450 BCE was "drawn up by a board of ten men (decemviri legibusscribundis ...)".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_501_ItRomMR] An important trend in the nature of Roman government in the Early Republic was the rise of the plebeian class to positions of power and status. This particularly accellerated from about 444 BCE when began a period historians have called the "Conflict of the Orders". The tribuni militum consulari potestate (consular tribunate) emerged briefly during this time of disruption (to be abolished 367 BCE). "Between 444 and 392, consuls were often replaced by three, four, or six military tribunes with consular power (consular tribunes) and in all years between 391 and 367 by six consular tribunes."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_502_ItRomMR] This was an elected office that could be held both by members of the powerful families and the Roman citizens.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_503_ItRomMR] "Here the Romans devised a college of up to six magistrates who had the consular 'power' to lead an army yet who did not have imperium and whose auspices were deficient in some way. The idea perhaps was to keep members of the plebeian class - who were eligible for the office - away from the highest public auspices."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_504_ItRomMR] Nevertheless, after the consular tribunate was abolished by the lex Licinia Sextia "and the consular constitution was reestablished for 366; henceforth plebeians were eligible for election to one of the consulships, and in more than half the years between 366 and 342 a plebeian was elected."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_505_ItRomMR] Due to the murky nature of the sources, however, we can only be certain of much of what we know about the structure of Roman rule such as "a double magistry and a conflict between ruling classes (patrcians) and Roman citizens (plebeians)" from about 367 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_506_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br><i>Institutions of the Roman Republic</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] c270 BCE "most of the classic institutions of the middle Republic, as described by Polybius in the second century, were in place."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_507_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR] the most recent best sources of information about them: Consulate, Senate (Bonnefond-Coudry 1989, Ryan 1998), popular assemblies (Farrell 1986, Yakobson 1999, Pina Polo 1989, 1996, Laser 1997, Millar 1998, Sandberg 2001, Morstein-Marx 2004), aedileship (Sabbatucci 1954), tribunate of the plebs (Lobrano 1982, Sancho 1984, Thommen 1989), censorship (Astin 1982, 1985), dictatorship (Hartfield 1982, Hurlet 1993), praetorship (Brennan 2000).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_508_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>comitia centuriata (Centuriate Assembly)</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Originally the army. "Under a consul (or, theoretically, a praetor), the assembly passed important legislative bills (rogationes) into law (lex, plural leges) and voted on war and peace). Under a consul (or dictator, interrex, or consular tribune), it elected consuls, praetors, and censors. Under a consul or praetor (after the assembly was convened, 'lending' auspices to the tribune of the plebs), it conducted popular trials if the penalty was death."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_509_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Comitia curiata (Curiate Assembly)</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "gave 'military auspices' to consuls and to praetors once they were elected by the centuriate assembly, and also to dictators and nonmagistrates cum imperio."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_510_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>comitia tributa</i> - <i>Tribunes and concilium plebis</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] - assembly of all citizens. divided into voting districts. In the Regal period the king's power was his 'imperium' and in theory this enabled him to do whatever he wished. In practice, he consulted with a consilium (advisory body of aristocrats) which later became the 'senate'. According to tradition the king "also sought the (well-organised) approval of the people in assembly (populus)"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_511_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR] comitia tributa. Tribal Assembly. "After 241 B.C., there were four tribes in Rome itself and thirty-one around the city. New territory, as added, was incorporated administratively into existing tribal units; freedmen, however, were restricted to the four urban tribes. Consuls and praetors presided in this assembly, where individuals had equal votes within their tribes and a majority of tribes determined decisions. The assembly voted on legislation, elected minor magistrates, and conducted some popular trials if the penalty was a fine. Under the lex Domitia of 104 B.C. (suspended 81-63 B.C.), seventeen tribes chosen by lot elected members of the principal colleges of priests."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_512_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR] From 494 BCE, after a protest/strike against debt-bondage (nexum),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_513_ItRomMR] Roman citizens were permitted to elect two leaders called tribunes (their number later increased to 10).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_514_ItRomMR] and have an assembly known as the concilium plebis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_515_ItRomMR] This citizen assembly was able to try the ruling families for crimes against ordinary Romans.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_516_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR] Concilium Plebis or Comitia Tributa - "the people organized by tribus, areas of domicile." tribunes of the plebs - top plebeian official.

"financial and administrative officials who maintained public records, administered the treasury (aerarium), acted as paymasters accompanying generals on campaigns and were financial secretaries to governors."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_521_ItRomMR] In 2nd century BCE the quaestorship <i>(a provincial appointment?)</i> "was an entry-level office; it had limited powers, and in this period was usually held around age 30."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_522_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Censors</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Before 387 B.C., when the territory of recently conquered Veii was annexed and formed into four new tribes (Livy 6.5.8), Roman territory had been divided into twenty-one tribes. The city itself formed four urban tribes, and the surrounding countryside was organized into seventeen rustic tribes. Membership of these geographical tribes was assigned by censors. Although the office of censor was created in 443 B.C., it was not until the late fourth century B.C. that the Romans began to elect censors regularly about every five years. During the early history of the office (443-38 B.C.), censors were elected on average about every nine years (Austin 1982). The censors were always two in number and held office for eighteen months. Their primary duty was to conduct a census of the Roman people, which involved taking statements under oath from adult male heads of households as to the members of their family and their property holdings; on the basis of these formal declarations, the censors assigned every adult male to a tribe, to an economic class, and to a place within the comitia centurata, and every household's taxes to the state were calculated according to the assessed value of its property. This entire nexus of the comitia centuriata, census, tribal organization, and state taxation was attributed to King Servius Tullius by the ancient tradition."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_523_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR] elected position. Two magistrates "that involved some especially important sacral and civic duties".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_524_ItRomMR] The office of the censor (censorship) from 443 BCE but not always present were two officials who enrolled citizens into military service.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_525_ItRomMR] In 351 BCE the first censors was elected from outside the ruling families.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_526_ItRomMR] c339 BCE lex Publilia ruled that one censor should be a plebeian.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_527_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Aediles</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] elected by comitia tributa. "Two plebeian magistrates administered temple of Ceres, function later "extended to public buildings and archives (of the plebiscita and senatus consulta). From 367 BC two curule aediles were elected from the patricians. The plebeian and curule aediles had similar functions at Rome; they were in charge of the maintenance and repair of public buildings (such as temples, roads and aqueducts), of markets (especially weights and measures), of the annona (to the time of Julius Caesar), and of public games and festivals (to the time of Augustus, when games were transferred to praetors)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_528_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Praetor</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] elected by comitia centuriata. "In 366 BC the praetor urbanus (city praetor) was introduced, who was almost exclusively concerned with the administration of law at Rome. The praetor ... was the supreme civil judge. By the middle republic the praetors' powers were restricted to law and justice... By 241 BC a second praetor ... was established to deal with legal cases in which one or both parties were foreigners. ... there were eight by 80 BC. Praetors issued annual edicts that were an important source of Roman law."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_529_ItRomMR] "A third magistracy, the praetorship, was also established in 367."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_530_ItRomMR] The first plebeian praetor was in 336 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_531_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Consuls</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] elected by the comitia centuriata. "commanders of military forces ... presided over meetings of the Senate and implemented its decisions." They "were always patrician until 367 BC, when plebeians could stand for office." Their minimum age "increased to 42 in the 1st century BC)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_532_ItRomMR] A praetor maximus might have been a principal magistrate "at the head of the newly born republic."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_533_ItRomMR] According to Alexander Bergk "the three chief magistracies created in the year 367, two consuls and one praetor, were colleagues. When wars took place increasingly far away from Rome, the permanent presence of at least one magistrate with imperium in Rome was required. The praetor then lost his military function and the city of Rome was his usual field of action. Only then did the hierarchy of consuls and praetors emerge, and the cursus honorum was born."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_534_ItRomMR] Polybius described consuls as supreme commanders of the Roman army[MAJIDBENAM_REF_535_ItRomMR] but also "the consuls carried out a great number of civil tasks, mainly, but not only, during their stay in Rome at the beginning of the consular year after taking office, a stay that could last a few weeks or months depending on the changing circumstances of internal and external politics."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_536_ItRomMR] Consuls were also "head of Roman diplomacy ... they had to receive foreign embassies in the Urbs and introduce them, if necessary, in the senate".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_ItRomMR] Consuls "had legislative initiative, although the number of consular laws passed during the middle republc was relatively small and unquestionably smaller than that of tribunican laws; on occasion, the consuls were commissioned by the senate to conduct extraordinary investigations the consuls were responsible for and promoted many public works, such as a large number of the temples erected in Rome between the fourth and second centuries, and many roads built in Italy during that period; the consuls were responsible for appointing a dictator; and finally, they presided over the elections".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_538_ItRomMR] Consuls had ritual duties such as "public vows, the expiation of prodigies, and the appointment of the date for the celebration of the Feriae Latinae, as well as presidency over the festival at the Mons Albanus, presidency over the public games, and especially responsible for the proper performance of a ver sacrum."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_539_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>State treasury</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Treasury called aerarium or aerarium Saturni (treasury of Saturn).

They valued marriage and marital harmony, but the striking fact is that only one surviving author of the Roman empire, Musonius Rufus, made an unambiguously (p. 681) strong case for sexually exclusive marriage. Plutarch, in his Advice to the Bride and Groom, ultimately urged women to bear a husband’s escapades lightly. The Roman model of marriage simply did not demand sexual exclusivity from men. To call it a double standard is to trivialize the problem. The Greeks and Romans operated with a dual standard, two patently different sets of expectations in sexual behavior. This pattern was rooted in social structure. Female chastity was enforced in the name of ensuring patrimonial legitimacy. While men were viciously punished for violating free women, they were permitted to use dishonored women - prostitutes, concubines, and slaves - as sexual partners. Public law reinforced the system by protecting the sexual honor of respectable women and exposing dishonored women to the remainder of male desire. Salvian complained that Roman policy amounted to “forbidding adulteries, building brothels.” The average age at marriage strengthened the dual standard, with men entering marriage nearly a decade after sexual maturity. Young men were simply assumed to enter marriage with sexual experience. Married men also enjoyed sexual freedom with slaves and prostitutes, since adultery was determined by the status of the woman involved.150 Flagrant excess was poor form, but hardly damnable."

The primary purpose of the public religious system was to protect and enhance the community of the Romans; the modern notion of a separation of church and state would have been unthinkable to the Romans. The welfare of the city and its inhabitants was ensured by a series of rituals by which the Romans attempted to secure the goodwill of the gods, and the primary role of the religious authorities in Rome was to ensure that these rituals were performed in the proper way, at their proper time, and in their proper place. The second point follows from the first: Roman rituals were performed in specific places around the city of Rome in order to protect the city. Some of these places had been considered sacred from time immemorial, while others had gained their status over the years, but each location had its specific ritual that needed to be performed on that spot, and at a specified time of the year." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_776_ItRomMR]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ disputed_present_absent ♥</b> Roman attitudes to charity were rather complex--a comprehensive summary may be found in Parkin [MAJIDBENAM_REF_777_ItRomMR]--of which the following is an extract. "Cicero and Seneca are perhaps our most forthcoming sources on private pagan charity, and some of their comments look at first glance very promising for this enquiry. Cicero says that if one has money, it should be used for good deeds - beneficentia - and generosity - liberalitas - through which one may win fame and the love of the masses (amor multitudinis). However, so that money is not wasted, it must be given only to suitable (idonei), needy (indigentes, tenuiores, inopes) people, and in a measured way (Off. 1.68, 2.36-7, 2.52-5, 2.61-2, 2.69). Seneca claims to help a needy person, an egens or pauper (Clem. 2.6.2; Ben. 4.10.4-5; Ep. 120.2), and says that he expects no other return than gratitude, and that it satisfies him to do what is necessary: he calls such giving a social act, a socialis res (Ben. 3.8.3, 4.10.5, 4.11.1, 5.11.5). On closer examination, however, it quickly becomes clear that the ‘needy’ in question in both Cicero and Seneca’s thought are respectable citizens, and not the most desperate members of their society. Seneca advocates giving to a poor man <i>of worth</i>, who will be grateful, where a rich man may not. Cicero provides more detailed guidelines: the worthy should be virtuous and respectful, should have a special relationship with the giver, and should give a return. This is the semiotics of patronage. Indeed, Seneca makes this explicit: tossing a beggar a coin does not constitute a beneficium. [...] Liberality, doing good works and mercy (liberalitas, beneficentia and clementia) feature among the Roman virtues, and are symptoms of the much-prized humanitas. Misericordia, or pity, however, is more complicated and was not always portrayed as a positive characteristic. The Stoics, in particular, saw in it sickness and disturbance of the soul. Their ethics dictated that the wise man was to feel no pain over the misfortunes of his neighbour, for pity brings grief. [...] The influence of the harsh Stoic attitude to emotion is more evident in Seneca’s writing, in which we find obedient acknowledgement that pity is the error of a weak soul, which is brought low by the sight of a stranger’s misery (Clem. 2.5.1, cf. 2.6.4). Seneca elaborates: pity comes from the sight of misery and misfortune which has happened to people who do not deserve it (Clem. 2.5.4). The wise man does not experience this weakness, but gives alms to the anonymous poor in the street and is as ready to help as someone who feels pity (cf. Cic. Tusc. 4.43-57; Acad. 2.44.135; Sen. De Ira 1.9.2). This is an important statement. Not only does Seneca by implication advocate almsgiving whilst rejecting that such acts must necessarily be the consequence of pity, but he also implies that other, less enlightened, people do give to beggars out of pity.8 So it seems that Seneca and, to a lesser extent, Cicero prize moral principles which are not necessarily in step with the charitable practices of their society.9 Indeed, the Stoics’ stern rejection of pity and other human emotions earned them criticism from other ancient thinkers. Many people, Seneca has to admit, consider pity to be a virtue (Clem. 2.4.4). NOTE: Cicero lived during the Late Republic, Seneca during the Principate--so we are inferring continuity between the Middle Republic and these periods.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> munificence present from early on [MAJIDBENAM_REF_778_ItRomMR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_779_ItRomMR]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ communal dining ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ morality ♣ present ♥</b> "Questions of belief or morality were not central to the religious system, though this statement should not be misinterpreted as meaning that the Romans did not believe in their gods or that they did not concern themselves with morality.

If we extend the range to take into account the possibility that early gladiators were sacrificial victims, a number of 100 seems appropriate. Indeed, recorded instances of early munera indicate a maximum known number of 120 gladiators: "Livy Summary 16 (264 BC): To honor his father, Lucius Junius Brutus was the first to organize a gladiatorial munus. [Valerius Maximus and Ausonius give further information about these games, saying that they involved three pairs of fighters. Livy 23.30 (216 BC): Also, in honour of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, who had been consul twice and augur, his three sons, Lucius, Marcus, and Quintus exhibited funeral games and twenty-two pairs of gladiators for three days in the forum.

The meal has been interpreted as a symbolic compensation to doomed victims or as a ritual device to turn lowly, vile human sacrificial victims into worthy, noble sacrifices.37 Since the banquet was offered to all victims (gladiators, bestiarii, and even Christian noxii), it seems to have been retained as an archaic remnant, and as such it recalls the originally horizontal status of all arena victims.38 Like the ambiguous love/hate dynamics of Aztec sacrifices or Greek scapegoat rituals (discussed in ch. 4 below), this was a traditional preparation of generic victims, not a privilege acquired by professional gladiators over time."

(The earlier sacrifice occurred in 228 BCE when the Gauls were invading, and a later one apparently occurred ca. 114 after another military defeat in Illyria (see Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome, pp 331-2). Pliny the Elder (28.3) also writes: 'Our own age even has seen a man and a woman buried alive in the Ox Market, Greeks by birth, or else natives of some other country with which we were at war at the time. The prayer used upon the occasion of this ceremonial, and which is usually pronounced first by the Master of the College of the Quindecimviri, if read by a person, must assuredly force him to admit the potency of [prayer] formulae; when it is recollected that it has been proved to be effectual by the experience of eight hundred and thirty years.'"

Those whose accomplishments on the battlefield won them renown were recognized as the Republic’s natural leaders, a connection made explicit in the aftermath of Cannae. Losses in that disaster and prior reverses had so depleted the ranks of the Senate that a special effort had to be undertaken to replenish its membership. The men selected were, first, those who had held various minor public offices, then ‘‘those who had spoils taken from the enemy on display in their homes or who had been decorated for saving the life of a citizen in combat’’ (Livy 23.23.5-6; see also Chapters 16 and 24). The civic crown, a wreath of oak leaves awarded for saving a citizen’s life, was bestowed for an act of exceptional gallantry: one had not only to save another’s life but slay the enemy threatening him without giving ground in the fight (Gell. NA 6.5.13). Likewise a young aristocrat won spoils by stripping the enemy he killed in individual combat in a duel or in the general meˆle ́e of battle (Gell. NA 2.11.3). This principle extended to all the decorations for valor awarded to soldiers; they bespoke courage in circumstances when there was no need to endanger one’s life, bravery ‘‘above and beyond the call of duty,’’ in other words. Worn in religious processions, they formed an important element in one’s public image (Polyb. 6.39.1-10; see also Chapter 13). Renown (gloria) seen in the visible tokens of one’s courage and heard in others’ praise of one’s exploits (laus) paved the way to public office, at least initially. [...] Superior courage in combat thus set some men apart from others and fit them to lead. As such, it served as a central element within the system of values that justified the dominance of the Republic’s upper class. Outstanding valor was thought to have accumulated in certain families, so that over time their descendants came to be viewed as having a greater store of it than others and hence a greater claim on public offices and positions of leadership."

Romans occasionally appointed public bankers (i.e. the quinqueviri mensarii in 352 BCE and the triumviri mensarii 216 BCE) to deal with emergencies but their responsibilities and capabilities seem to have been quite limited. Argentarri (private bankers) assayed and changed money, but also accepted deposits, made payments on behalf of clients and came to have an important role at auctions where they provided credit to buyers. Nummularii were active in Italy by the end of the second century, but confined their activities to assaying and money changing until well into the imperial period. Barlow argues that 'a tremendous expansion of Roman banking and moneylending' began in the late second century BCE. Coactores argentarii ('deposit bankers') appear early in the first century, as did the tessarae nummulariae which may have facilitated the long-distance transport of coinage. By the late Republic, Italy seems to have a sizable banking sector with the argentarii most prominent within it."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_862_ItRomMR] "In early Greece temples lent money to the local population and served as safe repositories for valuables and money.
