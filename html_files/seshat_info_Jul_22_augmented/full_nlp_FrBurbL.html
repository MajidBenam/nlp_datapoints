The Late Bourbon period began as King Louis XIV consolidated monarchical power in 1661 CE and ended when King Louis XVI signed the National Assembly’s proposed constitution in 1789 CE. Nickname the “Sun King”, Louis XIV came into full power after the death of cardinal minister Mazarin in 1661 CE. The king was an avid patron of the arts, creating academies for dance, science, music, and architecture, supporting French writers, and expanding the Louvre. The palace of Versailles, then the largest building in Europe, was constructed by Louis XIV in the 1670s and 1680s.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_FrBurbL] The king also nullified the Edict of Nantes that gave rights of worship to the Huguenot Protestants with 1685 CE Edict of Fontainebleau.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_FrBurbL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]While the first two periods (1661-1672 CE and 1673-1688 CE) of Louis XIV’s reign were marked by prosperity and expansion, the third period (1689 to 1715 CE) of the Sun King’s reign ended in frustration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_FrBurbL] France was involved in a succession of wars between 1682 CE and 1712 CE (including the War of the League of Augsburg and the War of Spanish Succession) which united much of Europe against Louis XIV. Public debt also increased under the Sun King and France suffered from famine from 1693 to 1694 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FrBurbL] Under Cardinal Fleury, the regent of the second Late Bourbon King Louis XV, France entered a sustained period of peace and economic expansion from 1726 CE to 1741 CE. In the 18th century, the Enlightenment began to dominate the public sphere, and became a catalyst for the French Revolution which overthrew King Louis XVI in 1789 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrBurbL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The French Kingdom was expanded under Louis XIV. However, France lost most of its colonial territories in the Seven Years’ War under Louis XV, and gained only Lorraine (1766 CE) and Corsica (1768 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FrBurbL] France covered 2.5 million square kilometers in 1700 CE but only between 700,000 to 1.54 million square meters in 1750-1789 CE. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_FrBurbL] More research is necessary on colonial expansion and loss of territories in this period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]King Louis XIV changed the relationship between the king and his government by ruling as his own prime minister. Under the rule of the Sun King, the Estates General and the Assembly of Notables did not meet, and the Assembly of the Clergy was tightly controlled.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_FrBurbL] Louis XVI was forced to reconvene the Estates General as the National Assembly during the French Revolution. The National Assembly forced Louis XVI to sign a constitution which limited his right to rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_FrBurbL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of the French Kingdom was 21.8 million in 1685 CE and 28.5 million in 1789 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_FrBurbL] In the Late Bourbon period, the population of the bourgeoisie increased from 700,000 in 1700 CE to 2.3 million in 1789 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_FrBurbL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=FrBurbL&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [2,000,000-2,500,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers.  1723-1743 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_FrBurbL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]France [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_FrBurbL]588,000: 1550 CE931,000: 1600 CE2,600,000: 1650 CE3,100,000: 1680 CE2,500,000: 1700 CE1,000,000: 1750 CE[700,000-1,540,000]: 1750-1789 CE</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ 21,800,000: 1685 CE; 23,400,000: 1715 CE; 25,300,000: 1745 CE; 28,500,000: 1789 CE ♥</b>21,800,000: 1685 CE; 23,400,000: 1715 CE; 25,300,000: 1745 CE; 28,500,000: 1789 CE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FrBurbL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]17th-18th century France: 20 million [MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_FrBurbL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Famine 1661 CE.

Government Ministers were, however, able to raise money through the Church, Provincial Estates and the city of Paris. A state-central bank, the Banque Generale (soon called the Banque Royale) was established in 1717 CE to enable the state to pay off debts and borrow large amounts of money. The scheme, which incorporated paper money and the prospect of colonial riches, failed disastrously.

In the seventeenth century the crown needed to raise vastly greater revenues as well as develop different ways of raising loans...A host of traitants and financiers came into being,” as the new credit system became increasingly tied to ministerial and noble clans. (24) However, there was a failure to create a state credit system that could deliver loans with low interest rates during wartime. The failure of John Law’s system of paper money tied to a state bank in 1720 made it impossible to move away from the seventeenth-century credit mechanisms based on the farmers general, the sale of <i>rentes</i> through provincial estates and municipalities, and loans registered through the Paris parlement.

a preoccupation with the vicissitudes of the monarch’s life, their essentially political nature. Others were more novel features in the realm of Old Regime ceremonial, warranting the conclusion that the period from Louis XIV’s reign onward— when these sorts of fetes became common— witnessed the emergence of a new festive regime. First is their prolonged duration and massive scale, dwarfing any religious ritual in the city’s calendar, even the great general processions. The Fête de la Ville for the recovery of Louis XV in 1744 took up the entire month of September; that for the reestablishment of the parlement in ran for two weeks. The celebrations in honor of the duc de Richelieu in lasted over three weeks. Other lesser political festivities were more limited in duration but still extended over several days at least, often longer. Much of January for example, was devoted to celebrating Louis XV’s escape from the mortal intent of Damien’s knife. These festive moments, in short, could bring the business of the city to a virtual standstill for weeks at a time. Of course, one aspect of the city’s business was precisely its ceremonial and festive offerings, which, in attracting thousands of visitors, routinely filled its inns to capacity and lined the pockets of its merchants as well. "During virtually every one of these great festive occasions, the activities were not limited to the streets. Another feature of the new style of fete is thus the existence of a parallel realm of celebration to the public exercises, one that allowed the elite to socialize in their own, protected environment. These festivities, usually dinner parties and balls, were not strictly private affairs, for the elite of the city— the magistrates of the parlement and municipal officials— normally attended ex officio; but they did rigorously exclude ordinary people. And their tone was decidedly refined, or at least opulent. Those offered on the occasion of the Fête de la Ville for the peace treaty with Portugal in 1763 were typical of the sort periodically enjoyed by the haut monde Toulousain. On one evening First President Bastard and his wife hosted a party in their town house to which all ladies and gentlemen “of condition” were invited. It was a lavish affair, with the hôtel’s interior entirely redecorated with tents, balconies, tapestries, and special illuminations. Nearly two hundred diners gathered, the women served by the men. Dancing afterward continued until seven the next morning. The following day the Hôtel de Ville was the scene for another dinner dance for a select group of notables. Barthès remarked on “the good taste of the feast, the grace with which it was served, the quantity and delicacy of meats, the beauty of the illuminations, the splendid concert that took place during the meal, and finally the variety and quality of wines and liquors served.” Again there was dancing in a ballroom entirely done over for the occasion. This time the revelers held out until dawn. The following day the same celebrants regrouped at the Cordeliers’ convent for the performance of a symphony, a musical form new to the eighteenth century. "If the elite of Toulouse enjoyed a range of privileged pastimes during great festive moments, the authorities made sure to provide the general populace with varied amusements of their own. And these popular diversions were another important feature of eighteenth-century secular fetes. Most evenings during a Fête de la Ville saw public dancing in one of the city’s main squares— not the sort of frolicking typical of carnival or neighbourhood bals populaires but a sponsored amusement in a public space policed and condoned by the municipal authorities. On several occasions the fete was complemented by boat races on the canal or the Garonne. During others the public was offered outdoor theatrics. For the Fête de la Ville honouring the parliament’s reestablishment, for example, the capitouls constructed three stages in the Place Royale: one for an orchestra, another for a performance by marionettes and actors, a third for a high-wire and juggling act. Finally, wine, flowing freely from specially constructed public fountains, almost always lubricated popular participation in the festivities. If everything else failed to make people jubilant— and attune their spirits to the official celebration of their monarch’s health or fortunes— alcohol could at least render them properly light-hearted. "But these profane diversions were matched by solemn religious rituals— masses and Te Deums. Thus, for at least a moment during the great eighteenth-century fetes, some of the celebrants would turn toward God, rendering thanks for the health of their king or the peace that had been proclaimed. These were, however, moments of privileged communion reserved for the elite that gathered in the cathedral— presumably on behalf of the entire urban community. It is notable that general processions, that quintessential public devotion, for centuries the traditional urban rite, were never staged on these occasions. Their centrepiece was rather the fireworks display, the great pyrotechnical marvel that seemed to overtake eighteenth century ceremonial throughout France. This was perhaps the most distinctive feature of the new fete. To be sure, fireworks, having been imported from Italy during the Renaissance and perfected at Louis XIV’s Versailles, had long been mounted in France. But their scale, pyrotechnical complexity, and the frequency of their mountings far exceeded those staged in earlier times. One indication of this is their cost: in 1643 fireworks for the occasion of the feast of Saint-Etienne, the patron of the cathedral, cost seventy-five livres; expenditures for the pyrotechnic display to celebrate the return of the parliament in 1775 totalled nearly six thousand livres."

The service has its origins in the Last Supper of Jesus Christ, described in the three Synoptic Gospels. The term appears as early as the 4th century (St. Ambrose, missam facere). "The most basic division within the Mass is that between its first part, the Fore-Mass or Liturgy of the Word, and the sacrificial rite proper that follows. For the early church, these are called the Mass of the Catechumens and the Mass of the Faithful, since the Catechumens, those undergoing instruction before baptism, were dismissed before the onset of the sacred mysteries. The Fore-Mass consisted at first only of an initial greeting from the presiding priest or bishop, readings from Scripture, a discourse (homily or sermon) on the readings, and concluding prayers. This is obviously a service of instruction, altogether appropriate for Catechumens. There were three readings rather than the medieval two: an Old Testament reading, one from an Epistle or the Acts of the Apostles, and one from the Gospels. There were no chants until the late 4th century, when a psalm, the apparent ancestor of the medieval Gradual, came to be a regular feature of the Fore-Mass. Its verses were chanted by the lector and answered by a congregational refrain. A second psalm, the Alleluia psalm, came by the early 5th century to be sung in the church at Jerusalem after the Gradual psalm, as prelude to the Gospel; it was not taken up immediately in the West. "After the dismissal of the Catechumens, the eucharistic rite began with the 'prayers of the faithful.' Next, the elements of bread and wine were brought in, and the presiding priest said the eucharistic prayer over them. The medieval Latin version of the prayer is present already in the De sacramentis of St. Ambrose of Milan (d. 397). Present also in the 4th century was the chanting of the Sanctus and the Lord’s Prayer, which formed the high points of a dialogue between celebrant and faithful, sung in all probability to the same simple tones employed in the Middle Ages (see Levy). During the distribution of the eucharist, a communion psalm was sung, generally Psalm 33 (34), with its Verse 8 as congregational refrain: 'Taste and see that the Lord is sweet.'

[...] [W]hen penitential piety became fashionable among a portion of the faithful, it was with processions, marked by the chanting of hymns, the marchers' bare-feet, their hooded shrouds, and whips hanging from their waists or applied to their backs, that this form of piety was made known to the community of on-lookers. [...] Like other confraternities, the penitential companies staged frequent processions; on their patron saint's day, on various holy days, or on the occasion of a member's funeral, when the penitents themselves would form his burial cortège. Two days, in particular, were marked by penitential processions, Holy Thursday and Corpus Christi Day. [...] We must be careful of literal interpretations. Despite the extreme nature of the ceremony, there was an element of restraint to the penitents' regime, at least compared to the practices of the mediaeval Flagellants who, by all accounts, were quite uninhibited to the point of frenzy and even death in their bloody displays. The penitent did not abandon his family and community to take up a life of perpetual mortification, as the Flagellants had done; rather, he remained among his townsmen, a member of his guild or corporation, only to return from time to time to put on the shroud and take up the whip. [...] Their rites were not mere pantomimes; the whip was applied with force and blood did flow. [...] Thomas Platter, an itinerant Swiss medical student, watched with fascination a procession in Marseille in 1597 of the 'battus,' as he mistakenly called the penitents, and noted the holes in the backs of their robes for the application of the whip. He also remarked on their bloody flesh and the tears that stood in their eyes. An article from the statutes of the White Penitents of Avignon advised members to repair to the 'infirmerie' in the company's chapel after their public procession.49 The White Penitents of Toulouse, like other penitential companies, allowed for both public and private flagellation; for the latter their statutes stipulate that 'in order for aid to be given rapidly to the disciplined, two brethren will put themselves at their disposition to care for them if necessary.' Clearly there were grounds for concern, and clearly the penitents took their devotions seriously. Those of Puy 'disciplined' themselves at every station of their long procession on Holy Thursday. Even some confrères of Henri Ill's penitential company used the whip during their nocturnal pilgrimage to Vincennes in 1583. [...] As actors in a new form of religious theatre, what were the penitents performing? On one level, of course, their rites were performances of public penance. In this sense the penitential procession took on the aura of a propaganda ceremony in which stalwart Catholics acted out their faith in penance - one of the 'works' whose efficacy the Reformers had denied. But the penitents were doing more than offering a riposte to the Protestants' denial of a central sacrament. They were also recalling early mediaeval and even primitive rites of penance, when transgressors were called to atone for their sins through physical ordeals performed in public. The Reformers did not have a monopoly on the past. Catholics too could look to a by-gone era of Christianity, a time when Church devotion was reputedly both simple and more sincere, and offer this as a model for the present. [...] In short, the penitents were among the many forces that promoted spiritual renewal through physical penance."

[...] In the French monarchy of the seventeenth century, the touch for scrofula definitely took its place among the solemn ceremonies with which the sovereign's splendour was surrounded. Louis XIII and Louis XIV practiced it regularly on the great festivals - Easter, Pentecost, Christmas or New Year's Day - and sometimes on Candlemas, Trinity Sunday, the Assumption, and All Saints' Day. [...] In this reign, the miraculous rite became an integral part of the country's regular life. In 1633, a significant innovation was introduced, by which the service of 'healing' was incorporated into the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, which the Church put into the hands of everyone. In short, the picture we get is that of a well-supported miracle, which had become one of the institutions of a well-ordered monarchical State" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_421_FrBurbL] NOTE: It is not very clear whether kings truly "controlled" this power, or whether, when they touched the scrofulous, God worked through them.

For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the first was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or official to extend the definition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage. It was tantamount to downing a beer and a sandwich and calling that the eucharist, or diving into a pond several times and calling that baptism writ large. This simply could not be. It was not only a 'legal impossibility,' as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too. Medieval writers labeled such misuses of the concept and institution of marriage by Christians as 'heresy,' 'blasphemy,' and 'desecration' - an insult to God and his sacraments.

It seems logical to assume that material on such a simple commandment would be brief and to the point, but catechism authors expanded this commandment into a lesson on community relationships rather than simply an admonition against murder. As a result, lessons on the fifth commandment were often the longest and most specific of any of the commandment lessons. In an Auxerre catechism, children learned that if they harmed their neighbor in any way, they had broken the fifth commandment. The text outlines three sins against one’s neighbor: harm against body, soul, or reputation. Harming in body meant killing, wounding, or striking another; children learned that if they sinned in this way they had to apologize to the o ff ended party and compensate them for any harm caused. Harming a neighbor’s soul is described as causing scandal and leading others to commit sin as a result[...] There were two ways that one could harm another in reputation: slander (<i>calomnie</i>) and gossip (<i>medisance</i>). Those who committed these sins were told that they had to publicly recant in order to be forgiven. Finally, the Auxerre catechism ends with a list of additional sins forbidden by the fifth commandment, including hatred, injuries, mockery, and curses."

And, like most of the other commandments, the lessons on the seventh commandment covered more than just the obvious sins. For example, an Arras catechism published in 1745 listed three general categories of theft: taking knowingly and unjustly the goods of others; dishonestly retaining other people’s things; and causing damage to the goods of another. The lesson then included numerous examples of the most commonly committed 'thefts' by people of all social categories. The word 'steal' thus took on new meanings: the rich stole from the poor through unjust lawsuits, through usury, or by overcharging them for 'trifles'; merchants stole from their customers when they sold bad merchandise, when they sold goods at a higher price than necessary, or when they consciously bought goods from others for less than their true value; workers stole from their employers when they did not use their workday wisely and honestly. Even magistrates who made poor judgments or submitted to bribery had broken the seventh commandment. Other catechisms provided similar lists of common thefts, including fraud, unjust lawsuits, usury, nonpayment of wages to workers and servants, destruction of crops or vines, and unfair distribution of the taille. Thus, a seemingly simple commandment became a lesson in community ethics. [...] The eighth commandment, against bearing false witness, was presented in relation to the second commandment, reminding children again of the importance of honesty in legal depositions and providing further injunctions against lying, slander, and gossip."

Bishops and theologians had to be able to make sure that children knew of their responsibility to remain pure in body and soul, but they did not want to give them details that might put inappropriate ideas into their heads. Lessons on the sixth commandment were thus intentionally short and vague. A Besançon catechism included only seven questions and answers in a lesson on the sixth commandment, admonishing children to avoid 'dances, conversations with the opposite sex that are too free, vanity, immodest clothing, going out with the breast uncovered, excess in drinking and eating, reading novels and comedies, and, especially, idleness.' The word 'chastity' is used in only one question-and-answer set, and the wording of most of the text is so ambiguous that if the commandment itself had not been printed at the beginning of the lesson, it would be hard to know exactly what it was about."

This is another aspect of catechetical education that the clergy and the laity could easily agree on, so fourth commandment lessons were often quite extensive. It was advantageous to families, to the parish, and to society as a whole for children to learn to properly respect their parents and other authorities. In a Grenoble catechism, for example, children learned that to honor their parents they had to respect, love, obey, and assist them. The text then listed dozens of instructions surrounding these four duties, including having esteem for parents, helping them acquire good things in their lives (especially things related to their souls and their salvation), obeying them immediately and happily in all things, and praying for them in sickness and affliction. The lesson included an equal number of inappropriate behaviors toward parents, from simple disobedience to abandoning parents in their old age."
