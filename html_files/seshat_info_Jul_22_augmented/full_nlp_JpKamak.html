The Kamakura period begins with the rise to power of Minamoto no Yoritomo who was granted the title of Shogun by the Emperor in 1192 legitimizing his role as de facto ruler of Japan.  'Mainly because of this need for legitimacy - but also partly because it has long been a practice in Japan to maintain some degree of continuity with the past amidst change - his government was a mixture of old and new. It became known as the bakufu (tent headquarters), a term used of the headquarters of commanders in the field, and in theory was merely the military arm of the imperial central government. The old central institutions were left largely intact, though weakened... Recent research has suggested that the court retained a greater vitality than previously believed, especially with regard to bureaucratic matters, and that religious institutions also played a significant role in the political world. In that sense, rather than simple warrior rule such as characterised the succeeding Muromachi period, it was perhaps more a case of cooperative rule during the Kamakura period.<i>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_JpKamak]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Japan - Kemmu Restoration ♥</b> (1333CE-1336CE)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ none ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 0 ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Kyoto ♥</b> Kyoto was the official capital of the Japanese empire, and residence of the imperial family, from 794 until 1868.

In 1192 CE, Minamoto military victory received official recognition when Minatomo no Yoritomo was appointed shogun (great general) by the emperor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_JpKamak] Although the emperor in Kyoto remained the nominal ruler, as the first shogun, Yoritomo managed to avoid court influence and intrigues by locating his base of operations close to his traditional support base in Kamakura, near present day Tokyo, from which the period takes its name.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_JpKamak] The Kamakura Shogunate marks the beginning of Japan's medieval era, which saw the rise of warrior rule combined with a feudal system of landholding and administration.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_JpKamak] While the borders to the east, west and south remained roughly constant, the exact extent of the polity's territory to the north was not rigidly defined.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The 'peak' of the Kamakura Shogunate could be considered to coincide with the reign of the Hōjō regent Hōjō Yasutoki (r. 1224-1242 CE), who was responsible for institutionalizing the way the <i>bakufu</i> (military government) mediated disputes and governed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_JpKamak] The period ends in 1333 CE with the overthrow of the shogunate and the restoration of the Emperor Go-Daigo.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The shogunate, also known as the <i>bakufu</i> (literally 'tent headquarters'), issued in a new period of military governance. However, many of the older institutions inherited from the Heian period persisted, albeit in weakened form.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpKamak] The degree to which the imperial court lost its power is still somewhat uncertain, and some scholars have argued that there was more cooperation between the court and shogunate than previously thought.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpKamak] The central political relationship now became that between the lord and his vassals: loyalty, either willing or enforced, formed the basis of governance.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpKamak] The shogun rewarded loyalty with grants of estates and offices. Vassals collected taxes but retained a portion, depleting the revenue of the central government. Warriors became the political, social and economic elite, drawing their economic power from their landholdings.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Echoing developments in the preceding Heian period, when imperial power was tempered by that of powerful regents, the shogun became functionally subordinate to hereditary regents from the Hōjō family (who lacked the necessary social rank to become shoguns in their own right) after the death of Yoritomo in 1199.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpKamak] In 1274 and 1281 CE, there were two failed Mongol invasions; this external threat may have helped to mute any internal dissent until the restoration of Emperor Go-Daigo.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The historian William Wayne Farris gives an estimate of between five and six million for the population of the Kamakura Shogunate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Kamakura Shogunate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Kamakura_1200CE: 1185CE-1299CE; Kamakura_1300CE: 1300CE-1333CE ♥</b>  Kamakura_1200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_JpKamak] Kamakura_1300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  301050: 1185CE-1299CE;  287470: 1300CE-1333CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Japonic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Japanesic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Middle Old Japanese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Japanese State Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Japanese Mayahana ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Gréine Jordan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpKamak&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 295,000 ♥</b> KM2[MAJIDBENAM_BR]I have provided the gross land figure for Japan’s three main islands Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_JpKamak] 'The western and southern borders remained more or less constant, while in the north there may have been some limited expansion into southern Hokkaido. Beyond this is it difficult to be specific. The problem is that in the medieval period we no longer have any convenient yardstick for measuring the extent of Japanese ‘territory’. The old provinces and districts continued to exist, at least in name, but the state ceased to play an active role in defining or maintaining territorial units of local  administration. On a smaller scale, the government was involved in defining the boundaries of private landholdings, both by conducting land-surveys such as the ōtabumi of the Kamakura period, and by resolving land disputes through the judicial system. However these activities had merely local significance and did not result in any clarification of Japan’s borders as a whole.

Although the fortunes of particular extended warrior families waxed and waned, only members of the warrior class could serve as shoguns, the military rulers. Their governments, known commonly as shogunates, were often challenged by the interests of other powerful warrior families in various parts of Japan and by the imperial family in Kyoto. Although the warrior bureaucracy largely controlled the affairs of the state, the emperor and the imperial court were still the formal head of government. Warrior governments typically sought out- or forced-the formal imperial decrees that gave legitimacy to the shoguns. Occasionally emperors would attempt to reassert direct imperial rule. They were, however, always suppressed in favor of warrior rule. During the first part of the Kamakura period, the shogunate and the court more or less shared governmental authority.Warrior governments functioned as a lord-vassal system of loyalty. This is reflected in the political structures of the different shogunates. Although they varied greatly in their organization, the notion of loyalty, whether earned or forced, always laid the foundation on which the warrior government was built.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_JpKamak] 'The shogunal regent (shikken) system put into effect by the Hojo family further transformed the relationship between court and shogunate.

Disciple[MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Honen and, especially, Shinran present interesting cases in the problems of institutional development in the Kamakura schools. Both of them preached a form of salvation requiring total reliance on the power of Amida Buddha and complete denial of self. Implicit in that view is the repudiation of any qualitative difference between teacher and follower and, by logical extension, the rejection of the hierarchy necessary for setting up a religious organization. This attitude is exhibited in its purest form in Shinran's assertion, preserved in the Tannisho, that he was on the same plane with other believers and that he shared with them the same faith. The resistance to formal religious organization intimated in Shinran's statement was one of Kamakura Buddhism's revolutionary characteristics. Notwithstanding these antiorganizational inclinations, religious bodies did take shape, with the Kamakura originators at their center. This process of formation is seen in the examples of Honen and Shinran alike. They themselves functioned as guides and advisers in matters of religious faith but around them revolved a great number of organizers and proselytizers.'[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Because specialized training and understanding are part of Zen, it is impossible for ordinary members of the organization to stand above the teacher or master.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The following is also worth noting: 'With the exception of Zen in the early period, particularly the Soto Zen school of Dogen, all the schools of Kamakura Buddhism actively proselytized among lay people. Hence, as the religious organizations gained greater structure, groups of believers had considerable say in the school's operation. The clerical organizers of the schools functioned primarily as leaders of ritual and religious practice, but the people who oversaw the organization's economic affairs were often lay adherents. Through their combined efforts the Kamakura schools gained a high degree of institutional stability, though the power and vitality of their teachings were sometimes diluted by institutional concerns.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Shinran taught that all people are equal in the sight of Amida Buddha. He was critical of the clerical ideal that existed in the established Buddhist schools, and he described himself as neither priest nor layman. Because of this outlook, the Shinshu religious organization, during its formative period at least, consisted of nothing more than individual congregations. In congregational dojo there was no great difference between dojo leaders and ordinary believers, in either intellectual capacity or economic means. But this idyllic period of Shinran's school did not last long, for a master-disciple relationship gradually evolved between the dojo head and the average adherent.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'˜Details of the early gozan network are unclear, but the surviving records indicate that the Hojo regents in Kamakura took the initiative in honoring and regulating the new Zen monasteries that they were building, by adopting the Southern Sung practice of organizing an official three-tiered hierarchy of Zen monasteries.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ [4-5] ♥</b>--Early Kamakura Military Structure-- [MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>4.

Command of the main host was entrusted to Yoritomo’s brother Noriyori, whose “accompanying troops” consisted of thirty-two named vassals and “more than 56,000 horsemen under them,” while a second division,commanded by Yoshitsune, included seventeen named vassals and “more than 20,000 horsemen under them.” Three points stand out from this account. First, the text assigns no formal titles to Noriyori and Yoshitsune, describing them only as the “commanding ofﬁcer for the main force” (ōte no taishōgun) and “commanding ofﬁcer for the ﬂanking force” (karamete no taishō gun). Second, the identiﬁcation of only three levels of warriors - divisional commanders, named vassals and “horsemen under them” - and the ratio of ofﬁcers to other warriors (the improbable overall numbers notwithstanding) testiﬁes to the lack of articulation in the army. And third, the assignment of vassals to the divisions betrays no logical pattern, beyond grouping warriors of the same surname together. Both forces included men of Taira, Minamoto and Fujiwara descent; both included men from various provinces;and men from the same provinces were split between the divisions.

Thus the organizational structure under which late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century warriors served looked something like the system depicted in Figure 2.3.

This warrior class law, known as bukeho, was quickly disseminated throughout the land... The first official codification of the warrior-class laws, called the Joei Shikimoku, was issued in 1232 by the Kamakura shogunate, and it would set the tone for all the edicts issued by the military government for essentially the next 700 years. This code served to clearly define the roles of samurai lords and their vassals and was based on a combination of many of the local legal codes that antedated the shogunate. Thus, it was the first centralized national legal code compiled from all of the minor regulations that had been in existence on local estates, in military regimens, in monasteries, and in regional government offices. The last, and most important, function of this new law code was to clarify the now limited authority of the imperial court at Kyoto from which the warrior class had assumed power.

They were attached to poles, or feet, which were hinged so that the support could be collapsed and stored or transported flat. Approximately one and a half meters tall and less than half a meter wide, mostly such shields were made of several planks joined vertically. Although shields could withstand more force if each was made from a single board, this was the exception rather than the rule. Protective substances such as lacquer could also prolong the life of such standing shields; however, by the end of the Kamakura period, decoration usually consisted solely of a family crest.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_153_JpKamak] ‘Typically, shields of this sort were lined up, sometimes overlapping like roof tiles, to form a portable wall that protected archers on foot. They were also placed atop the walls of fortiﬁcations and hung from the sides of boats. On occasion, they served as substitutes for other tools, such as benches or ladders. Japanese warriors never, on the other hand, appear to have developed muchinterest in hand-held shields, probably because of the incompatibility of this sort of armament with mounted archery.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_154_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Helmets ♣ present ♥</b> 'The basic form of helmet (kabuto) that dominated medieval and early modern armor was shaped generally like a skull cap with an opening at the front top and flaps at the sides intended to protect the neck and face. In addition, the neck was shielded by a series of three or five metal plates. By the end of the Muromachi period, most ordinary helmets were made from iron and/or steel. The helmet was formed from individual plates fastened with rivets or simply joined together. The top portion of the helmet, shaped like the pate of a human head, was called the hachi. In the early medieval period, from the 11th to 14th centuries [CE], hachi were almost invariably rounded.'

Shinto, the “way of the kami (gods),” is the term used to describe Japan’s indigenous tradition, although Shinto as an organized tradition with common doctrines and practices probably dates back no further than the medieval period.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_203_JpKamak] ‘The foreign traditions of Buddhism and Christianity impacted Japan during the medieval and early modern periods. Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the sixth century from the Asian mainland and quickly became the religion of the aristocrats and the imperial family, thus assuming political significance. It was not until Japan’s medieval period that Buddhism became broadly diffused throughout Japanese society.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_204_JpKamak] ‘Although individual Japanese religions can be discussed, it is important to bear in mind that in many periods of Japanese history—including the medieval and early modern—distinctions between traditions were not very sharply drawn. This was true both in terms of a person’s worship and in terms of Japanese culture more generally.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_205_JpKamak] ‘in medieval and early modern Japan, practice was far more central to religious identity than was any profession of faith.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_206_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Religious rituals, though directed to numerous different ends, were often intended for life cycle events such as birth, marriage, and death. Religion was often intimately connected to the everyday, rather than directed beyond daily life. Festivals, too, celebrated various key events in the life of a community. Festivals were held in celebration of the harvest, the New Year, and to honor the spirits of the dead. Both rituals and festivals were methods of personal purification, showing appreciation for the fertility of the land, making offerings to honor the gods, Buddhas, and ancestors, requesting help in troubled times, and seeking the welfare of the community.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_207_JpKamak] ‘in medieval and early modern Japan, a very close connection between religion and the state was deemed both proper and necessary. Though there are exceptions, religion was often treated as ancillary to politics. Used to create national identity, religion served the nation as a means of providing legitimacy for political arrangements current at any given time. Japan’s national myth, that Japan was created from the sacred acts of the kami whose descendants form the imperial line, is one such use of religion to justify political power. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_208_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR] ‘Annual observances celebrated at the imperial court beginning in the Heian period (794-1185[CE]) differed radically from those held in farm villages. Whereas court ceremonies derived in large part from Chinese customs, village rituals tended to be indigenous and related to rice agriculture.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Shinto</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Unlike many religions, Shinto has no founder and does not view any single text as its sole scripture. Shinto is closely associated with the Japanese sense of cultural identity. Shinto emphasizes practice over thought or formal doctrine. There is not a formal Shinto theology or rigidly codified set of moral rules. Shinto is intimately connected with the agricultural cycle and a sense of the sacredness of the natural world. The worship of kami and other ritual practices express these concerns... Ritual practice is central to Shinto traditions and includes such activities as purification, food offerings, dance, and festivals honoring the gods. While kami may be worshipped at shrines under the supervision of Shinto priests (kannushi), they can also be worshipped individually at a shrine or in the home. Further, Shinto associations (ko) provide yet another avenue for interaction with the kami.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_210_JpKamak] ‘On the one hand, Shinto describes an organized set of doctrines and practices related to the state. This perspective on Shinto is strongly tied to the mythology and founding stories of the imperial family, especially as expressed in the Kojiki (Record of ancient matters, compiled in 712). Shinto was important to the legitimating narratives by which the imperial family justified its right to rule. This aspect of Shinto was conspicuous for the rituals performed expressing the intimate connection between emperor and kami.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_211_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b> Buddhism</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Buddhism originated in India and spread to China about four centuries after the time of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni (ca. fifth to fourth century, B.C.). It was transmitted to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula around the middle of the sixth century.1 The cultural gulf that existed at that time between Japan on the one hand and China and Korea on the other was considerable. Japan's ruling class accepted Buddhism as the embodiment of an advanced and superior civilization, and in order to gain control over the concepts and technology that Buddhism brought to Japan, the elite provided a succession of large temples where Buddhism could put down roots.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_212_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'it was in the Kamakura period that Buddhism in Japan came into full flower. The forms of Buddhism that emerged at that time - Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren - were largely responsible for the dissemination of Buddhist beliefs and practices throughout Japanese society. The success of this movement lay in tailoring the ideas and goals of Buddhism to the concerns of the populace at large. Hence, Kamakura Buddhism, as the entire religious movement is called, has left an indelible mark on Japanese history and has made Buddhism a lasting and pervasive component of Japanese culture.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_213_JpKamak][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'From the end of the twelfth century through the middle of the thirteenth - that is, in the first half of the Kamakura period - some of Japan's foremost religious figures appeared, in quick succession. The schools of Buddhism that today claim them as their founders have long had considerable influence in Japan. From their inception in the Kamakura period, these schools stood as a separate religious movement from the eight schools that existed before them. These new schools came to be known collectively as Kamakura Buddhism. The establishment of Kamakura Buddhism was a pivotal event in Japanese history, because through it Buddhism was adapted to Japanese ways and thus made accessible to the common people.'[MAJIDBENAM_BR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_214_JpKamak]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpKamak&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ matsuri ♥</b> NOTE: Though normally Seshat policy is to code a specific ritual rather than a "type" of ritual, it does not seem that a particular one of the traditional Japanese festivals was more widespread than the others. Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_215_JpKamak] For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson [MAJIDBENAM_REF_216_JpKamak], that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai.

Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts.

[...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_257_JpKamak] For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson [MAJIDBENAM_REF_258_JpKamak], that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai.

[...] It must be added, however, that few of the ‘old rituals’ survived intact after the Meiji government’s radical revamping and restructuring of Shinto so that it could serve as a national creed (see Hardacre 1989)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_300_JpKamak] "In large shrines, the routine and rituals of the day are fixed throughout the year; whether or not visitors come to the shrine, these are followed. [...] At [8 a.m. every morning] the act of morning worship (<i>cho-hai</i>) takes place, involving all the shrine priests and staff. The <i>norito</i> is recited, the staff purified for the day, and announcements made about the day's events and duties." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_301_JpKamak] "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami."

Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_337_JpKamak] For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson [MAJIDBENAM_REF_338_JpKamak], that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai.

[...] According to custom, the heads of respectable samurai were cleaned and the hair combed before being examined. The cleaning of the decapitated heads sometimes fell to samurai women. A rare eyewitness account, recorded by the daughter of a samurai living in the castle during a battle, yields a description of this repugnant operation. The young girl, later known as Oan, the daughter of the respectable samurai Yamada Kyoreki, experienced the horror of sleeping beside a collection of severed heads in the Ogaki Castle of Mino during the great Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Although Oan’s experience was written down in a much later period, I cite from it because samurai women’s memoirs detailing the practice of wars are so uncommon: ‘My mother and I, as well as the wives and daughters of the other retainers, were in the tenshu [the highest building in the castle] casting bullets. Severed heads taken by our allies were also gathered up in this area of the castle. We attached a tag to each head in order to identify them properly. Then we repeatedly blackened their teeth. Why did we do that? A long time ago, blackened teeth were admired as the sign of a distinguished man. So, we were asked to apply a generous coat of ohaguro [a black dental dye] to any heads with white teeth. [Tooth-dyeing, a popular practice among the ladies of the court in the Heian period, was also affected by male aristocrats and warriors from the late Heian through the Muromachi periods.] Even these severed heads no longer held any terror for me. I used to sleep enveloped by the bloody odor of those old heads.’ [...] Here it is important to note that, even in the face of imminent defeat, the cosmetic beautifictation of the heads was regularly carried out. This act of cleaning the heads was in part a sign of respect for fallen warriors. More to the point, it represented a tribute to the victors’ honorific pride as men who could defeat heroic enemies. And the tangible proof of one’s prowess, in the form of a pile of severed heads, would certainly result in better rewards from one’s lord.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_379_JpKamak] Turnbull [MAJIDBENAM_REF_380_JpKamak] adds that “Head collecting is a tradition found throughout samurai history” and that “It was a practice that probably has roots in folk tradition because the handling of a corpse went wholly against the purity dictated by Shinto.”</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_463_JpKamak] Because polygyny was common among the Japanese aristocracy, it seems reasonable to assume that the above quote applies to this polity as well. “Polygamy by both genders was common in the early period, but as time went on, only males were still able to take on ‘other’ wives.

Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_465_JpKamak]  According to Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_466_JpKamak] “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_467_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

This point is captured in one of the central Buddhist virtues: dana, which is ‘giving’ or ‘generosity’. ‘Giving’ creates a win-win situation. Not only is the gift’s recipient benefited but also the gift’s donor - particularly from a Buddhist point of view, since through giving one counters attachment in its deep-seated form of greedy grasping, of not letting-go.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_469_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake.

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_520_JpKamak] “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_534_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions. Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_535_JpKamak]  According to Buddhism: “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_536_JpKamak] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended.

In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_543_JpKamak]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other supernatural enforcement ♣ present ♥</b> Piety.

The paradigmatic act was performed by Izanagi-no-mikoto when he has escaped from Yomi-nokuni where, according to the mythology recorded in the Nihon Shōki (720), he was visiting his deceased wife. The purpose of purification is to remove tsumi (impurity) and kegare (impurity caused by various human conditions) and restore human nature to its primal and pure state. Thus the idea that human nature can in some sense return to its divine origins lies behind all other related concepts. [...] Human beings are born able to live in harmony with the divine and with nature, but because of the various forms of impurity that overtake life, purification becomes necessary. Hence the importance of purification to effect restoration.// The goal to be achieved by the performance of misogi shuho , purification using water, is the cultivation of reisei , the Shinto ideal of spirituality. As the spirit is purified again and again, it can rise to the level of the divine as its spiritual sensitivity is heightened.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them.
