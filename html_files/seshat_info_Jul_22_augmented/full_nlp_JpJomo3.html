Water flooded low valleys, and some Kanto sites are as much as fifty kilometers from the present shore. [...].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The shell mounds of this stage contain chiefly freshwater clams (<i>Yamato shijimi</i> or <i>Corbicula japonica</i>, and marine haigai or <i>Anada granosa</i>) and oysters (magaki or <i>Crossostrea gigas</i>). Animal bones - not numerous - are chiefly those of deer, boars, flying squirrels, and Siberian mountain lions. Investigations indicate that mainly older deer were hunted, that the fast-breeding wild boars were killed indiscriminately, and that mountain lions were dying out. In the more isolated areas of western Japan, animal life was reduced, leaving fewer resources for human survival. The higher temperature encouraged the growth of the evergreen oak forests (Quercus) that covered much of west Japan.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The warmer temperature was also conducive to the growth of warm-water <i>Anadara granosa</i> as far north as the Daigi shell mound near Matsushima Bay, although its habitat is now south of Tokyo. On the other hand, the coldwater mollusk (Pecten yesoensis), now thriving in northeast Honshu, could not stand the warmth and is therefore missing from the Early Jomon shell mounds of that area.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Around the middle of the Early Jomon, reliable food sources and somewhat longer stays near the coast produced a dramatic increase in population. According to Koyama's calculations, the Early Jomon population numbered around 106,000, or five times that of the Earliest Jomon, an increase unmatched at any other stage of the Jomon period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Small Early Jomon villages, developed on bluffs, had pit houses grouped in the form of a horseshoe. The presence of pottery of several successive types at a single site indicates continuous habitation. As this occurred, family demands fostered advances in house construction. The older, poorer shelters or huts were now transformed by the introduction of substantial inner posts strong enough to hold a roof over a rectanguloid floor. Rainwater shed by the pitched roof was drained off through surrounding ditches. Kaya (a miscanthus) was probably the roofing grass, fifteen centimeters of which would have been enough to keep the interior dry. Toward the end of the Early Jomon, the inner space took the form of a square with rounded corners. Some fireplaces were moved inside, though rarely were placed in the middle of the floor. Indoor living now offered more attractions.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Houses were occasionally extended to accommodate growing families, but archaeological evidence reveals few repairs and almost no overlapped houses so often found at Middle Jomon sites. The forty-eight houses of the Minabori shell mound, located on a rather level plateau in Yokohama and distributed to form a rough arc, had doors facing an open space to the north. Because successive rebuilding did not alter this fundamental plan, it is thought that use of the common area had become well established. An improving economy is suggested by storage pits found both inside and outside houses. Such pits were lined by alternating layers of leaves and nuts in order to keep most of the pit's contents dry, allowing cupboard raids to expose only a little at a time.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Most of the house pits of Minabori contained Kurohama-type pottery belonging to the middle years of the Early Jomon. These flat-bottomed pots were designed for cooking, and their new shapes made them more practical for indoor living on intensely used floors that were tamped hard. A short-lived spell of tempering the clay with small fibers - a practice that perhaps started in the Tohoku and moved south - may have been connected with attempts to strengthen the walls of the pots when increasing their size and experimenting with flat bottoms. Heavy cord marking is typical, and before the Early Jomon phase was over, Moroiso-type pottery appeared, bearing imprinted and incised decorative arcs and parallel lines made with the end of a small split bamboo stick.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Recent excavations at the Torihama shell mound in Mikata-cho of Fukui Prefecture point up hitherto unknown advances in the Early Jomon. One of the rather few kitchen middens found on the west side of Japan, it lies beside the Hasu River in a laurel (laurilignosa) forest area dominated by oak. These excavations show that boars, deer, monkeys, raccoon-dogs, bear, serows, otters, martens, and badgers were hunted; several kinds of fish were caught; and a variety of freshwater shellfish, saltwater mollusks, clams, oysters, and ark shells were collected. Walnuts, hazelnuts, and acorns were also gathered. But of special interest are the bottle gourds {Lagenaria siceraria) and "green beans" (Phaseolus sp.) that were pea shaped and found in long narrow pods averaging eleven centimeters in length and thirteen beans to a pod. Many Japanese archaeologists regard both as cultivated plants, indeed suggesting that pollen changes indicate environmental alterations caused by clearing and that trees of foothill forests were cut and used for building materials, wooden tools, and firewood.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Preserved remarkably well are ropes, reed baskets, and many wooden objects, including oars, boards, adzes, bows, and carved bowls and a comb which are the oldest pieces of lacquer ever found in Japan. Other innovations were polished stone axes, bone needles, and thimblelike bone rings. Vertically angled blades were changed to adze-shaped tools by the use of right-angled tree forks, probably for better hacking and digging of new forms of vegetation.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Torihama is no longer an isolated case. Gourd seeds have also been found in the Early and Latest Jomon sites of Gifu and Saitama. The Middle Jomon Idojiri "bread," which has long defied analysis, is now thought to have contained some eight skins of beans. The Middle Jomon Tsurune settlement site in Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture, yielded two carbonized beans (Leguminosae) that are reportedly similar to a cultivated continental Asian bean for which there was nothing comparable in Japan." <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpJomo3&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣  ♥</b> in squared kilometers.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]310,783 This is the sum of the following Jomon-occupied regions: Tohoku, Kanto, Hokoriku, Chubu, Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku, Kyushu <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [400-1000] ♥</b> People.

From the Middle Jomon onwards, it is likely that these ceremonies also included drinking, as suggested by the finding of wild grape berries in vessels ideally suited for fermentation at a number of sites starting from the Middle Jomon <sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup>.

Though religious practices were changed during the succeeding Burial Mound period, many elements of early nature worship were retained. In this first period, people venerated spirits of the mountains, the fields, and streams near their villages, and they related tales that pertained to nature and the origins of the most remarkable features of their environment. People of this period developed magical rites to aid them in hunting, fishing, and farming, and they told tales that explained the origin of these rites.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"[...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Scholars have advanced a variety of theories to explain how the concept of kami originated and developed. The most likely explanation places the roots of kami worship in animistic forms of nature worship. [...] Some scholars maintain that the origin of Shinto lies in cults that venerated heroes or worshiped ancestors, that kami were originally human beings. Indeed, one aspect of Shinto as it developed in later ages was the veneration of historical and legendary figures, or ancestors of powerful families and clans. But as I shall demonstrate later in this chapter, elements of hero and ancestor worship were added at a later time. [...] Finally, Shinto was not an entirely indigenous development. The Shinto view of the cosmos, for example, is a complex and not wholly integrated view that contains influences from various parts of Asia and even Oceania. [...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The search for Shinto's beginnings leads us to the prehistoric Jomon and Yayoi periods. Though there is considerable discontinuity between the beliefs of these early periods and later ones, certain primitive strains were preserved in later religious practices. Our understanding of this prehistoric era is based primarily on archaeological evidence. The difficulty of interpreting such evidence makes it difficult, however, to reach a firm understanding of prehistoric rituals, myths, or concepts of the cosmos and divinity. But archaeologists have uncovered many artifacts that seem to have been used for religious purposes in very early times. For a somewhat later time, fragmentary historical evidence appears in Chinese chronicles, amplifying and clarifying the archaeological data.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The neolithic Jomon culture was supported by hunting, fishing, and gathering and later by primitive forms of agriculture. The succeeding Yayoi culture, on the other hand, was an agrarian culture in which bronze and iron implements were used and rice was grown as a staple food. It is likely that religious practices during these periods reflected, in part, the methods that people used to make their living. Jomon culture artifacts suggest that people of those days carried out magical-religious rites to guarantee the fertility of human beings as well as the fertility of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered. After primitive forms of agriculture were introduced, probably from abroad, some of these rites took on an agrarian nature.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Perhaps the most striking of Jomon artifacts are the dogu, human figurines that nearly all represent women whose exaggerated breasts and distended bellies indicate pregnancy. Some were even shown with a child protruding from the womb. Many have been unearthed near residential sites, and their placement within stone enclosures or on top of stone piles suggests that they were deliberately set apart, perhaps as objects of worship. This has led scholars such as Kokubu Naoichi to believe that the figurines were maimed, buried, and exhumed in magical rites that symbolized death and resurrection. Many archaeologists have surmised that the dogu represent female deities who managed the procreation of the earth and of human beings. The folklorist Hotta Yoshio identified primitive forms of the worship of fertility-mother deities called yama no kami (mountain kami) in hunters' and woodcutters' rituals that linger in the folk beliefs of northeastern Japan. Hotta suggests that the figure of the yama no kami in present-day folk beliefs originated from the prehistoric fertility goddesses represented by dogu. Other Jomon artifacts, probably used in fertility rites, are stone rods shaped like the male phallus. These rods have been found in the centers or corners of rooms at the sites of Jomon period houses and seem to have been objects of worship.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The functions of other items from the Jomon period are somewhat more difficult to identify. Pottery is often decorated with images of serpents, and in later times, at least, serpents were believed to be the spirit of the water that was necessary for cultivation. Other artifacts that may have been used in some form of magical-religious ritual were clay and stone masks, and wooden plaques incised with human forms or carved in the shape of human faces.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Some of the archaeological evidence from the middle of this period demonstrates the transmission of elements from south Asian, southeast Asian, and south Pacific island cultures. Jomon initiation rites that involved ritual tooth extraction and the custom of tattooing - apparent in the design of the dogu - were also practiced by southern peoples. In addition, it seems that the cultivation of taro root was introduced from these areas.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The importation of taro root cultivation may have given rise to the belief in a 'guest' kami or spirit (marebito), who was given credit for introducing this early form of agriculture. In prehistoric times, according to Orikuchi Shinobu, each village probably conducted yearly rites on a set day to welcome the guest kami from Tokoyo no Kuni, the Utopian land of boundless fertility across the sea. As a gift, the guest kami would bring a bountiful harvest, and he was also responsible for introducing and conducting coming-of-age ceremonies. Orikuchi finds evidence for his hypothesis in literary works of later times such as the Kojiki and the Man'yoshu, in extant New Year customs in the Tohoku region of Honshu, and in Okinawan harvest festivals hailing a visitor deity. Oka Masao points out the resemblance of these rites to those practiced in Melanesia, New Guinea, and elsewhere in the south Pacific. The masks unearthed from Middle Jomon sites might have been used by people who assumed the guest's role at festival times. In sum, the religious practices of the Jomon period probably involved fertility rites that acquired agrarian elements, many from other Asian and Pacific cultures, when cultivation was introduced." <sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-273">[273]</a></sup></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpJomo3&amp;action=edit&amp;section=66" title="Edit section: Deification of Rulers">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The following is relevant, but not enough to code this variable.

Is there any reason why similar status distinctions should not have developed within Jomon Japan, where economic conditions similar to those on the northwest coast prevailed? The high degree of organisational potential exhibited by Jomon societies, exemplified by the construction of large-scale features such as the ditch at Shizukawa, and the strength of what we might call Jomon cultural power, certainly provided the conditions for the appearance of a degree of social ranking and the accrual of individual status differences within the framework of Jomon society.//For example, in the middle of a community cemetery at the Late Jomon Yamaga shell midden in Fukuoka Prefecture, lies a woman with twenty shell armlets on her wrists [...]. Because of their fragility, she would not have been able to undertake any serious everyday work without considerable inconvenience. We should consider this woman as being of high status who avoided any manual labour. It is possible, although we have no evidence for this, that labour was undertaken for her by slaves. In addition, a man buried with a pattern-engraved deer antler hip ornament may also have been a person of high status. Watanabe Hitoshi pioneered discussions of the existence of stratification in Jomon society, and was supported by the eminent archaeologist Sahara Makoto in the view that social differences in the Jomon were institutionalised. Thinking this way, it is possible to interpret examples of adult women being buried with a slave who was responsible for seeing the child safely to the other world. Perhaps the tradition which includes the slaves described as attending and protecting the mythical Queen Himiko in the Yayoi period extends back deep in time to the Jomon.//There is one more component to the story of personal ranking; ear ornaments. Appearing around the end of the Initial Jomon and the beginning of the Early Jomon, these distinctive artefacts are suddenly found all over the archipelago. Although the distribution of these objects is very widespread, the numbers of ear ornaments from any particular site are very few. Typically less than one-tenth of burials from Jomon community cemeteries have earrings, and it seems that only certain people within these communities were allowed to wear them. Perhaps these people belonged to an elite class, at the top of the hierarchical social order, above ordinary people who in turn had more social status than our postulated slaves, who made up the lowest Jomon social group. Jomon archaeology continues to produce surprises, though, such as the recent excavations at Kuwano, a community cemetery in Fukui Prefecture, where many of the graves contained slit-stone earrings, a timely reminder that we need to be cautious in our interpretations regarding the precise nature of Jomon society, and that we are well-advised to keep an open mind on the social significance of particular types of artefact." <sup id="cite_ref-289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-289">[289]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery for co-religionists ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "Several ethnographic accounts of the native peoples of the northwest coast of North America report the existence of a class of person described as slaves, suggesting a high degree of social differentiation.
