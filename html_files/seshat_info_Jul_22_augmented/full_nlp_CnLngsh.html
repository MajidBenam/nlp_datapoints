the third millennium B.C., which has been defined by Yan Wenming (1992b) as the Longshan era (Longshan shidai, 2600-2000 B.C.) and by K. C. Chang as the Lungshan or Lungshanoid horizon (Chang 1977: 144-184, 1986: 238), is often indicated as the beginning of Chinese civilization, complex political organization, and, possibly, writing. Due to the incipient emergence of copper and bronze technology, and its chronological position between the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of the Bronze Age in the Xia-Shang, it has also been suggested that Longshan be termed Chalcolithic (Yan Wenming 1986). The existence of a sophisticated technology for the production of jade artifacts and the comparative wealth of jade finds dating to this period and slightly earlier have prompted some scholars to suggest that the term "Jade Age," a term first found in the text Yuejueshu "Waijuan Ji Baojian" (juan II, vol. 2) (1966: 3), may also be appropriate. 1 The concepts of stone, bronze, and iron ages were devised within the tradition of Western prehistory, and as they are problematic even within that framework, they should not be uncritically applied to other parts of the world." <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 3000-1900 BCE ♥</b> "The earlier part of this trajectory is associated with the so-called Henan and Shanxi Longshan (龙山) cultures, also known by other more localized names and dating to c. 3000-1900 BC."  <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> "Even in the area of the middle Yellow River, the trajectory is not the same for all subregions.

However, Taosi was not abandoned altogether, and evidence, including radiocarbon dates, suggests that it remained occupied until around 1700 BC (Zhongguo 2003, pp. 566, 838)."  <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> "In most regions, population growth during the Late Neolithic was coupled with the clustering of sites and the formation of site hierarchies.

The relatively regular spacing of these sites, at a distance of some 30-50 km from one another (Guojia 2006, 2007; Liu 2004), suggests that they were central nodes of small-scale polities each covering some 1,500-2,000 km2.

"When the chronologies of the various cultural types and systems are carefully traced, it becomes apparent that by approximately 4000 B.C. some of the adjacent regional cultures had come into contact as an inevitable result of expansion and that a number of ceramic styles began to assume a sphere-wide instead of merely a region-wide distribution. For example, among pottery vessel types, the ding and the dou are found in every region, often in large numbers, suggesting the wide distribution of a style of cooking formerly prevailing only in the Dawenkou and Daxi cultures. The perforated slate rectangular and semilunar knives represent another horizon marker, as do some pottery and jade art motifs that, as pointed out earlier, may reflect deeper substratal commonalities than recent contact. With the definition of "interaction spheres," for the first time we can discuss the issue of the name "China." I suggest that from this point on, as the regions with which we are concerned came to be joined together in archaeological terms and exhibit increasing similarities, the interaction sphere may be referred to as "Chinese."

Regardless of the exact number of hierarchical tiers (which in any case may be impossible to determine based on current data), the range in size, the more-or-less even distribution of the largest sites, and the association between labor investment and the largest site (Taosi) do suggest the development of a regional settlement hierarchy and the ability of the center(s) to recruit labor and accumulate resources." <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At the same time, there was an increase in the size of settlements.

I believe these remains are due to rituals for “political retribution,” a characteristic of state societies. This was the practice of a new political power to smash, destroy, curse, and make profane the ideological core of the previous power that it had vanquished. It represented the complete subjugation and annihilation of the old power, ensuring that it would never rise again. Common actions with the goal of political retribution are razing city walls, digging up burial mounds of ancestors, and destroying palaces and temples. The middle-period wall at Taosi had been utterly leveled before a new late-period wall was constructed. The large and medium-sized burials in the middle-period royal cemetery had all been destroyed and the corpses exhumed. The palace of the middle period had been razed to the ground, and it is clear that the key building IFJT3 was destroyed. The ditch we call IHG8 was dug in this area and filled with female corpses with cattle horns stuck in their private parts, with scattered human bones, with refuse and garbage, and with broken pieces of the toppled palace building. The former dignified palace district that used to be taboo for common people was ritually destroyed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the late period, moreover, the middle-period observatory was razed to the ground, and the corpse of a person who met a violent death was interred at its core (Zhongguo et al. 2004a). This was probably done to profane the sacred area that must have served as an altar to heaven. A pit (IIH24) with a diameter of 6.35 m and a depth of 1.2m had been dug into the third layer of the structure and filled with water (Zhongguo et al. 2007). I believe this was an attempt to ritually destroy the powers of the observatory linked to the sun and sky." <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Exclusiveness of rituals:"The middle-period small enclosure in quadrant II contains almost no remains from daily life, so it probably was not a palace area. It should be considered a ritual zone monopolized by the Taosi royalty because the small enclosure’s wall forms a protective ring around this special, sacred area. Commoners did not have the right to use the ritual observatory facilities here, which was the intention of building a wall around the special ritual area. As is stated in the Shangshu Yaodian 尚书·尧典, “recording time at Yao’s observatory was entrusted to the official astronomers of names Xi 羲 and He 和.”2 Issuing the calendar would have been the duty of the king. Associated ritual activities also would have taken place at the observatory. It is likely the king held ceremonies there by himself or entrusted officials to perform rituals on his behalf.

Below some of the platforms are pits filled with skeletons from human sacrifices. The largest sacrificial pit contains the remains of seven people, including young men, women, and children.

Based on the pottery typology and stratigraphic sequence (Anonymous 1985&nbsp;: 33, 81-82), the site of Hougang has been assigned to three Longshan oc- cupation intervals, which, following 14C dating, have been placed at approximately 2700-2500 B.C.

The resources needed for building a large walled settlement were far more than those used in ordinary settlements, thus requiring a very powerful central authority to organize the necessary labor. In addition, there is evidence at some sites for sacrifice of humans in rituals associated with the construction of wall foundations. For instance, in the western walled portion of Wangchenggang, 13 sacrificial pits filled with at least 17 human skeletons were found. The original number would have been more than this because of selective excavation." <sup id="cite_ref-184" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In Dinggong (Shandong): "Within the walls are houses, kilns, tombs, and ash- pits, as well as evidence of violent deaths (human remains were found in disused storage pits) and human sacrifices of both adults and children at the foundation of large buildings (He Deliang 1993: 2)." <sup id="cite_ref-185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Standardized rituals throughout the Longshan-influenced region?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The presence of several altar sites, and a whole array of ritual jade and pottery objects of comparable shapes over a good part of the Chinese territory, appear to indicate that by the Longshan era the standardization of ritual and religious practices and the formation of iconographic formulae was already well in place (Wu Hung 1990). This would include the finds of recognizable ritual objects, such as hi discs and cong tubes, beyond the Liangzhu nuclear culture to an area that ranges north-south from Inner Mongolia to Guangdong, and east-west from Shandong to Gansu (Huang 1992:78-80,[MAJIDBENAM_BR]figs. 9-10), and the existence of an established set of ritual vessel types (li pitchers, dou cups, ding tripods, etc.), which were to have a paramount religious importance throughout the early dynastic period." <sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Religious Beliefs.

They also were found at two major sites in the south: the large site of Wadian and the walled site of Haojiatai. One ox scapula found at Xiaopangou had more than 30 heating marks, presumably made for divination.Finally, earlier and simpler forms of rituals known in the later historical period seem to have begun during the Wangwan III period. A good example is the pottery lie gu 列觚, a ranked set of gu 觚 goblets excavated at the large site of Wadian.

To answer this question we need to turn to ethnographic analogy. The feasting activities of the Akha people in Northern Thailand have been documented by Clarke (2001), as summarized below, showing some parallels to the Kangjia situation. "The Akha have a transegalitarian society (i.e. between egalitarian and chiefdom). The people practice agriculture, relying on a fluctuating, somewhat unpredictable, but labor-intensive resource base. This economic condition underlies the collaborative nature of the social structure. In Akha society differences in wealth and power exist between individuals and family groups, but socio-economic inequity, competition, and aggrandizing behavior emerges primarily between the lineages and clans as a whole, rather than between individuals. Feasting, which is integral to the dynamics of clan/lineage relations in this society, indicates the need for a structured and dependable life-crisis support network (Clarke 2001: 144-149). "Akha life is replete with feasting. Their many types of feasts include ancestor offering, newborn naming, harvest, and life-cycle crisis. The scale of feasts also varies markedly, ranging from a few people and the ritualized consumption of food to enormous gatherings involving up to 1,000 participants, who may consume several water buffalos, pigs, and chickens over a period of weeks. The functions of feastings are primarily to provide solidarity and promote the prestige of social groups at various social levels from family to village. It is notable that the most elaborate feasts are often associated with weddings, building new houses, and funerals. These are the types of feasts intended to be grandiose and promotional (Clarke 2001: 151-153). "The Neolithic Kangjia community in several respects is similar to the Akha. Kangjia people relied on millet agriculture and animal husbandry, which were perhaps fluctuating resources during the post-climatic optimum period. This is suggested by the high infant mortality rate in the Kangjia pig population. The Kangjia social organization may be similar to that of the Akha, as the Kangjia settlement shows differentiation among house groups (a unique feature in T26 is paintings on several house floors) but without marked social stratification. The decline of domestic animals means that a large portion of protein in the human diet had to come from hunted animals, which required skill and teamwork to obtain them. In such ecological conditions, creating and maintaining alliance and cooperation between social groups, especially kinship related ones, would have been essential for the community’s survival. "[...] "Kangjia was apparently situated in an environment with abundant natural resources, which could have provided a basis for surplus production used by self-interested aggrandizers to gain prestige and power through conducting ritual feasting. "Feasting would have functioned as a social mechanism that created and maintained a life-crisis support group; it could also be an avenue for people to negotiate for power within their greater support group and a medium of competition for status between social groups. The ability to provide wild animals for feasting is an important condition for the families to gain political and religious prestige. Since it is usually the elite households that host and frequent large-scale feasting, the house group in T26 may have been the residence of the elite in the community, at least for a period of time." <sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ 1,000 ♥</b> Among the Akha of Northern Thailand, a reasonable ethnographic analogue for certain Longshan communities, "[t]he scale of feasts also varies markedly, ranging from a few people and the ritualized consumption of food to enormous gatherings involving up to 1,000 participants, who may consume several water buffalos, pigs, and chickens over a period of weeks." <sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "Feasting would have functioned as a social mechanism that created and maintained a life-crisis support group; it could also be an avenue for people to negotiate for power within their greater support group and a medium of competition for status between social groups.

To answer this question we need to turn to ethnographic analogy. The feasting activities of the Akha people in Northern Thailand have been documented by Clarke (2001), as summarized below, showing some parallels to the Kangjia situation. "The Akha have a transegalitarian society (i.e. between egalitarian and chiefdom). The people practice agriculture, relying on a fluctuating, somewhat unpredictable, but labor-intensive resource base. This economic condition underlies the collabora- tive nature of the social structure. In Akha society differences in wealth and power exist between individuals and family groups, but socio-economic inequity, compe- tition, and aggrandizing behavior emerges primarily between the lineages and clans as a whole, rather than between individuals. Feasting, which is integral to the dy- namics of clan/lineage relations in this society, indicates the need for a structured and dependable life-crisis support network (Clarke 2001: 144-149). "Akha life is replete with feasting. Their many types of feasts include ancestor offering, newborn naming, harvest, and life-cycle crisis. The scale of feasts also varies markedly, ranging from a few people and the ritualized consumption of food to enormous gatherings involving up to 1,000 participants, who may consume several water buffalos, pigs, and chickens over a period of weeks. The functions of feastings are primarily to provide solidarity and promote the prestige of social groups at various social levels from family to village. It is notable that the most elaborate feasts are often associated with weddings, building new houses, and funerals. These are the types of feasts intended to be grandiose and promotional (Clarke 2001: 151-153). "The Neolithic Kangjia community in several respects is similar to the Akha. Kangjia people relied on millet agriculture and animal husbandry, which were perhaps fluctuating resources during the post-climatic optimum period. This is suggested by the high infant mortality rate in the Kangjia pig population. The Kangjia social organization may be similar to that of the Akha, as the Kangjia settlement shows differentiation among house groups (a unique feature in T26 is paintings on several house floors) but without marked social stratification. The decline of domestic animals means that a large portion of protein in the human diet had to come from hunted animals, which required skill and teamwork to obtain them. In such ecological conditions, creating and maintaining alliance and cooperation be- tween social groups, especially kinship related ones, would have been essential for the community’s survival. "[...] "Kangjia was apparently situated in an environment with abundant natural resources, which could have provided a basis for surplus production used by self-interested aggrandizers to gain prestige and power through conducting ritual feasting. "Feasting would have functioned as a social mechanism that created and maintained a life-crisis support group; it could also be an avenue for people to negotiate for power within their greater support group and a medium of competition for status between social groups. The ability to provide wild animals for feasting is an important condition for the families to gain political and religious prestige. Since it is usually the elite households that host and frequent large-scale feasting, the house group in T26 may have been the residence of the elite in the community, at least for a period of time." <sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ 1000 ♥</b> Among the Akha of Northern Thailand, a reasonable ethnographic analogue for certain Longshan communities, "[t]he scale of feasts also varies markedly, ranging from a few people and the ritualized consumption of food to enormous gatherings involving up to 1,000 participants, who may consume several water buffalos, pigs, and chickens over a period of weeks." &lt;/ref&gt;</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "Feasting would have functioned as a social mechanism that created and maintained a life-crisis support group; it could also be an avenue for people to negotiate for power within their greater support group and a medium of competition for status between social groups.

"Meat is always the principal food in feasts. Since meat is not a daily component of the diet in agricultural communities, the offering of an expensive animal for sacrifice is reason enough to gain prestige (cf. Clarke 2001: 160). Therefore, skilled hunters would have greater opportunities to promote their social status in a community. This may have been the situation applying to the household in T26 [at the late Longshan site of Kangjia], which yielded evidence for specialized hunting (H79). In addition, hunting animals may carry symbolic meanings other than merely obtaining protein. Hunting in many complex societies is a strongly ritualized activity and success in hunting frequently is taken as evidence of supernatural approval and support (Helms 1992a). Therefore, successful hunting would ideologically reinforce the prestige of individuals and social groups. "This symbolic aspect of hunting may be observed in the late Shang dynasty, in which hunting was one of the significant ritual activities of the royal court. The animals, used as ritual sacrifice, played a role to link the kings with supernatural power (Fiskesjö 2001; Keightley 2000: 107-113). It is notable that the Shang kings’ favorite game include buffalo and deer (Lefeuvre 1990-1991; Yang Zhongjian and Liu 1949). More interestingly, Shang kings even traveled to the lower Wei River valley to hunt. As recorded by Sima Qian in 'Yin benji' in Shiji, King Wuyi was killed by lightning during a hunt in an area between the Wei and Yellow rivers. Hunting associated with economic, political and symbolic power may have had a long tradition back to the Neolithic period in this region, and the consumption of wild animals in ritual feasting was a tangible medium materializing the intangible symbolic power." <sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup> "Hunts that involved killing dangerous animals (as opposed to more docile animals such as domesticates, less aggressive herbivores, or smaller animals) and that also involved displays of people’s courage, prowess, and strength may have been both euphoric and dysphoric, involving such aspects as pride (in displaying prowess), exhilaration (surely a dramatic chase would be exhilarating), but also fear/terror depending on circumstances, such as the hunter being chased by the game or other scenes of danger." <sup id="cite_ref-257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (participants) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (audience) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b><b>Dysphoric elements</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fasting ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ vigil/sleep deprivation ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fear ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "Hunts that involved killing dangerous animals (as opposed to more docile animals such as domesticates, less aggressive herbivores, or smaller animals) and that also involved displays of people’s courage, prowess, and strength may have been both euphoric and dysphoric, involving such aspects as pride (in displaying prowess), exhilaration (surely a dramatic chase would be exhilarating), but also fear/terror depending on circumstances, such as the hunter being chased by the game or other scenes of danger." <sup id="cite_ref-258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-258">[258]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ humiliation ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ disgust ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ poisoning/dysphoria-causing drugs ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ pain ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Especially when the quarry is dangerous.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ mutilation ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ risk of death ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Especially when the quarry is dangerous.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other ♣ ♥</b></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Euphoric elements</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ feasting ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> If we consider the act of hunting itself as the ritual, it almost certainly did not include feasting--though a feast is a likely result of a successful hunt.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ alcohol ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ euphoria-inducing drugs (other than alcohol) ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ sex ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> If we consider the act of hunting itself as the ritual, it almost certainly did not include sex.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ dancing ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ synchronous movement ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Hunting large and/or dangerous quarry may well have required coordinated, and possibly synchronised movement on the part of the hunters, though of course there is no evidence for this.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ singing ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ entertainment ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "Unusual artifacts, including alligator-sklin drums and chime-stones, at sites such as Taosi in Shanxi suggest the importance of music in rituals." <sup id="cite_ref-259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup> Though music was certainly part of Longshan rituals, the evidence suggests that it was not mere entertainment, but used by shamans <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup> Elements of the hunt may well have been sport- or game-like.

"Meat is always the principal food in feasts. Since meat is not a daily component of the diet in agricultural communities, the offering of an expensive animal for sacrifice is reason enough to gain prestige (cf. Clarke 2001: 160). Therefore, skilled hunters would have greater opportunities to promote their social status in a community. This may have been the situation applying to the household in T26 [at the late Longshan site of Kangjia], which yielded evidence for specialized hunting (H79).

Based on the pottery typology and stratigraphic sequence (Anonymous 1985&nbsp;: 33, 81-82), the site of Hougang has been assigned to three Longshan occupation intervals, which, following 14C dating, have been placed at approximately 2700-2500 B.C. (early Longshan), 2500-2300 B.C. (middle Longshan), and 2300-2100 B.C. (late Longshan). <sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-273">[273]</a></sup> "The walls indicate social differentiation in Longshan society for more than one reason. The resources needed for building a large walled settlement were far more than those used in ordinary settlements, thus requiring a very powerful central authority to organize the necessary labor. In addition, there is evidence at some sites for sacrifice of humans in rituals associated with the construction of wall foundations. For instance, in the western walled portion of Wangchenggang, 13 sacrificial pits filled with at least 17 human skeletons were found. The original number would have been more than this because of selective excavation." <sup id="cite_ref-274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-274">[274]</a></sup> In Dinggong (Shandong): "Within the walls are houses, kilns, tombs, and ash- pits, as well as evidence of violent deaths (human remains were found in disused storage pits) and human sacrifices of both adults and children at the foundation of large buildings (He Deliang 1993: 2)." <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Maximum known number of victims in a HS event ♣ [6-8] ♥</b> "Wangchenggang (Fig. 7), the smallest Longshan walled settlement, measuring 0.8-1.0 ha, is characterized by the presence of several hangtu platforms (Anonymous 1983c: 8-20; Dengfeng Wangchenggang Yu Yangcheng 1992). Below some of the platforms are pits filled with skeletons from human sacrifices. The largest sacrificial pit contains the remains of seven people, including young men, women, and children.
