After his death in 104 BCE, his sons and grandsons engaged in frequent intrigues and civil wars involving much loss of life. While Alexander Jannaeus briefly conquered additional territory in the Transjordan, he soon lost it and much of Hyrcanus' earlier conquests following the disastrous Battle of Gadara in 93 BCE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣141-63 BCE ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ {vassalage; nominal allegiance}: 141-116 BCE; none: 115-63 BCE ♥</b> While Judea was technically a vassalage of the Seleucids in the earlier period, Jonathan and Simon assiduously played both sides of the Seleucid succession struggles against the middle, at times winning considerable practical autonomy. Circa 116 or 115 BCE, John Hyrcanus I broke away from the crippled Seleucid Empire and followed an independent policy, which lasted until his feuding descendants invited Pompey in.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Seleucid Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> This coding is arguable. The code book doesn't have a good descriptor for "successful political rebellion"; the new elites who ejected the Seleucids, the Hasmonean dynasty, were native to Judea, so "elite migration" doesn't really fit either. "Cultural assimilation" might fit, perhaps. At any rate, in 153 BCE the Hasmonean leader Jonathan "Apphus," having led a years-long guerrilla war against the Seleucids after the death of his brother (Judah the Maccabbi), was confirmed as High Priest and ruler of the Jews as a vassal of the Seleucid claimant Alexander Balas. In the swirl of conflict over the Seleucid throne, Jonathan fell into a trap and was executed in 142 BCE; he was succeeded by his brother Simon, who achieved a measure of quasi-independence from the Seleucids—though he remained a vassal and the population retained strong elements of Hellenism. Simon was confirmed as High King and Prince in a popular assembly in 141 BCE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Late Roman Republic ♥</b> Two brothers of the Hasmonean dynasty, King Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, contended for the throne in continual civil wars and intrigues from 67-63 BCE. Finally each appealed to the Romans in Syria under Pompey the Great to intervene on his side.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IlJudea] Pompey, seeing the opportunity, intervened on the side of the ineffectual Hyrcanus, besieged Jerusalem and took it in 63 BCE, and absorbed Judea into the Roman Empire as a protectorate.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Jewish diaspora ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣ 100,000 ♥</b>km squared.

It had once been believed by scholars that Aramaic had replaced Hebrew altogether (outside of religious contexts), but newer archaeological evidence has shown that view to be mistaken.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IlJudea] Greek, meanwhile, was introduced by the Macedonian Empire and reinforced during the rule of the Ptolemies and the Seleucids, and was additionally important as a trade language.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Semitic; Indo-European ♥</b>This map is representative of several maps that vary slightly; the precise borders cannot be determined from the records available. Note that Hasmonean control did not extend down into the Negev Desert.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Judea (originally Yehuda) polity of 141 - 63 BCE was formed when Simon Thassi, brother of the executed Jonathan Apphus who had waged war against the Seleucids, was elected as High King and Prince in a popular assembly in 141 BCE. Simon achieved a measure of quasi-independence from the Seleucids—though he remained a vassal and the population retained strong elements of Hellenism.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to archaeologists, it seems that Galilee was only sparsely settled before this period, and that the conquering of territories and increase in Jewish communities coming into the area contributed to the rise in permanent settlements and population during this time. However, agreements over the population differs widely, with estimates on the largest settlement, Jerusalem, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IlJudea][MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IlJudea][MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IlJudea][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Judea was a sophisticated, well-organised and equipped society, with markets, established trade routes, water transportation infrastructure, aqueducts and cisterns, temples and palaces, sporting arenas, libraries, and many other modern features.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IlJudea] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IlJudea] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IlJudea]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Oren Litwin ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IlJudea&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [5,000-10,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers. Very rough estimate from the varying descriptions of Judean territory. Records are not precise enough to provide finer-grained estimates by king.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Leibner,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IlJudea] in his archaeological survey of the Southeastern Galilee exclusively, estimates a population of some 10,000 people based on the distribution of pottery fragments, but acknowledges a possible range from 4,000 to 17,000. From the archaeological record, it seems that prior to the Hasmoneans, the Galilee was sparsely settled; the Hasmoneans conquered the territory and began a massive wave of Jewish settlement, suggesting strong demographic pressures within the Judean heartland.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IlJudea]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [10,000-100,000] ♥</b> Inhabitants. The population size of Jerusalem is the subject of wildly different views. Tacitus believed that during the Jewish revolt of 66-73 CE (some years after the Hasmonean period ended), Jerusalem had some 600,000 inhabitants; archaeological estimates of the population within the defensive walls range between 80,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IlJudea] and 20,000[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IlJudea] (which is almost certainly far too low; Geva assumes that much of the enclosed territory of Jerusalem was actually uninhabited, being royal or Temple precincts, but it is hard to imagine that such extensive buildings and fortifications could have been produced by so few people). Both estimates are based on population-density coefficients; however, it is not clear that the coefficients in use are reasonable. "Some of the densities recently put forward for area coefficients have been based on unwalled, premodern villages…. How similar is such a village to a walled Bronze or Iron Age town or city? Although this is not a case of comparing apples and oranges (more like oranges and grapefruit), it seems probable that the economic constraints of building a defensive system put a permanent physical limit on the settlement area," leading to higher population densities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IlJudea] (Another possibility that I have seen noted, but not in the scholarly literature, is that much of the population associated with a given ANE city might not have lived inside its walls at all, but would be semi-nomadic pastoralists circulating within its economic orbit. Such pastoralists would leave little trace archaeologically, which would pose problems for conventional population estimates.)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In any event, Jerusalem is generally believed to have grown significantly under the rule of Herod Antipas, immediately after the Hasmonean era ended.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ [150-190] ♥</b> in kilometers. We are basing ourselves on the distance between Jerusalem and Gamla (east of the Sea of Galilee), the capital of the Golan region.

In addition to these, there are a few small settlements [of less than 10 dunams area], mostly in fortified locations, with no small farms at all in the agricultural areas."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IlJudea][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

However, the winter-palace complex near Jericho has been partly excavated,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IlJudea] and was a remarkable achievement for its time; notably, it featured several large swimming pools more than 3 meters deep, filled with water conveyed by conduit from springs to the north, at a time when swimming pools were extremely rare. The complex also featured a large formal garden and paved plazas. During the reign of Alexander Yannai, the palace at the center of the complex was built over with a "fortified palace," defended with thick walls and tall towers; it would have been meant only to hold off a minor disturbance until troops from the nearby fortresses could be summoned. During the reign of Alexandra Salome, the "Twin Palaces" were built south of the pools, perhaps to accommodate each of her sons Yochanan Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II (who would later fight a series of wars with each other).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ height ♣ 8-12 ♥</b> in m.

Simon Maccabeus, brother of the murdered Jonathan, is appointed High Priest and <i>ethnarch</i> by Demetrius II, and is acclaimed by the people as <i>Nasi</i> (prince) in 141 BCE. 2. Simon and his two eldest sons are assassinated in 135 BCE by his son-in-law; Simon's third son, John Hyrcanus I, escapes assassination and becomes High Priest and <i>ethnarch</i>. 3. Hyrcanus I dies c. 104 BCE; he wanted the leadership to pass to his wife, with his eldest son, Aristobulus I becoming High Priest only; but Aristobulus jails his mother (who starves to death) and his brothers and declares himself <i>basileus</i>, i.e. king. 4. Aristobulus dies in 103 BCE of a painful illness; his brothers are released and Alexander Jannaeus becomes king. 5. Alexander Jannaeus dies during the siege of Ragaba in 76 BCE, and is succeeded by his wife, Queen Salome Alexandra. Her son Hyrcanus II becomes High Priest and is designated as Salome's successor. 6. Salome dies in 67 BCE and is succeeded by Hyrcanus II. 7. Hyrcanus rules for only 3 months before his brother, Aristobulus II, leads a rebellion. His forces defeat those of Hyrcanus, and the latter is stripped of the kingship and the High Priesthood. 8. Pompey the Great intervenes on the side of Hyrcanus II in 63 BCE; Hyrcanus II is restored to the throne, but this marks the effective end of Judea as an independent power.</div><div

bce and ends with its destruction in 70 ce. It was a time of momentous change in Judaism and of remarkable richness for Jewish literature, thought, and religion. The entire Hebrew Bible was written or assembled at this time, as was a large corpus of extra-canonical literature in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. The Temple in Jerusalem, destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 bce, was rebuilt and was the center of Jewish religion. [...] The written Torah came into being in the Second Temple period, and by the end of the period there was a collection of sacred texts that were becoming a fixed canon."

Simon was granted the power to mint his own coins, which amounted to granting Judah independence. That same year, Simon succeeded in expelling the Seleucid garrison from the Akra, a move that was both symbolic and substantive in overthrowing Seleucid hegemony. 1 Macc. 14 contains a declaration by the priests, elders, and people of Judah proclaiming Simon leader and high priest and allowing him to wear royal apparel 'until a trustworthy prophet should arise' (14:41). This qualification may indicate that although the Hasmoneans were accepted as kings and high priests, there was a consciousness that things were not as they should be. It is possible that there were some supporters of Hasmonean rule who thought that God would eventually restore the Davidic monarchy and the Zadokite high priesthood."

Polygyny, as the marriage of the same man to two or more wives with the same legal status, is distinct in scripture from concubinage, in which a man took secondary wives (usually foreigners or women of lower social standing). It is distinct, too, from a sexual relationship between a free man and a slave woman of his household, which seems to have been unrestricted. Lamech is the first polygamist named in the scriptures (Gen 4:19-24). Others include Esau (Gen 26:34; 28:9; 36:1-5), Elkanah (1 Sam 1:2), and Jacob (Gen 29:15-30).//Although the scriptures presuppose that polygyny is valid, they invite the reader to regard it with suspicion. Some unspecified doom is attached to the brief narrative about Lamech, a descendant of Cain, although nothing in the text attributes his misfortune to his having had two wives. Deuteronomy 17:17 counsels that a king should not have many wives lest his heart be distracted. Solomon’s downfall is attributed to his having many wives and concubines, although his attachment to foreign women may have been the chief source of his troubles (1 Kgs 11:1-6). The polygamous marriages of Esau, Elkanah, and Jacob were marred by favoritism and by discord among wives. The story of Abraham, his wife Sarah, and her foreign handmaid Hagar (Gen 16) drives that message home, although Hagar was presumably only a sexual partner, and not Abraham’s wife in the proper sense (notwithstanding Gen 16:3). But these negative associations fall short of opprobrium. Every family has it dysfunctional aspects, and the Jewish scriptures do not idealize the human condition."

Some impurities require simple purification rituals (washing, sacrifice), while others have the most dire consequences not only for individuals but for the entire nation. Leviticus 15:19-24, on the impurity of menstruation, illustrates ritual impurity: menstruation is an entirely natural process, no kind of moral stigma attaches to it, but it causes a mild impurity that requires abstention from sexual relations, bathing, and putting on clean clothes. Leviticus 18:24-30, on the other hand, speaks of the 'defilement' caused by engaging in the 'abominable' practices of pagan nations, which is so powerful that it will cause the land to 'vomit the inhabitants out', and the offenders to be 'cut off'.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_107_IlJudea] As for loss of seizure of property or wealth, in the "case of theft, biblical law codes, as also other law codes from the ancient Near East, require financial compensation in excess of the loss. Thus, for example, theft and slaughter of an ox require five oxen as restitution; a sheep necessitates four in return (Exod 22:1; cf. 2 Sam 12:6). [...] In the case of nonfatal injury, the perpetrator pays for the loss of time and arranges for complete recovery (Exod 21:18-19; cf. HL 10). In the event that an owner causes the loss of an eye or the tooth of his slave, the slave is set free—which represents a significant financial loss to the owner (Exod 21:26-27). In a discussion of personal injuries, Exodus 21:22 requires a punishment determined by the husband—with judicial consent—for the one who strikes a pregnant woman resulting in a miscarriage. [...] Exodus 22:16-17 mandates that a man who deflowers a virgin to whom he is not engaged must pay her father the bride-price and, if her father is willing, marry the woman (cf. Deut 22:28-29; MAL A 55-56). Leviticus 19:20-21 requires a man who has sex with a slave woman engaged to another man to bring a ram as an offering of compensation."
