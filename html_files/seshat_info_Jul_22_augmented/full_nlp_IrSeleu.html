A second peak in territory and population size occurred during the reign of Antiochus III 'The Great' (223 BCE - 187 BCE), who reconquered lost territory and reaffirmed the status of the empire [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 312-63 BCE ♥</b> The rule of the first king of the Seleucid Empire, Seleucus I, began when he was apportioned the satrapy of Babylonia in 319 BCE after the death of Alexander the Great [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrSeleu]. However, in 315 BCE Seleucus was overthrown by Antigonus,  but regained power in 312 BCE and began to extend the kingdom. The beginning of the empire is therefore generally agreed to start from Seleucus' return to power in 312 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrSeleu] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrSeleu].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The end of the empire was characterized by a decline from the former power of the kings, to the extent that Aperghis (2004, p27, 298) argues that after 129 BCE, when King Antiochus VII committed suicide in Media, the Seleucid Empire had degraded to the Seleucid Kingdom, and would only decline further. Opposition from the indigenous population and from growing rival states (the Parthians and Romans) culminated in irreversible decline for the Seleucids.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrSeleu] The remaining polity was eventually overtaken by the growing Roman empire in 64/63 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrSeleu] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state; confederate state ♥</b>The Seleucid kings kept as much power as possible in their own hands, and had the final authority over decisions of the state, including the appointment of regional governors [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrSeleu] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrSeleu].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Prior to the Parthians, political systems in Southwest Asia were for the most part relatively loose confederations in which central government ruled their 'empires' through unstable alliances with vassals and satraps.

The city grew to a population of 50,000-100,000 inhabitants in an area of roughly 550 hectares [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Greek ♥</b> Greek was used for most written documents.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrSeleu] Local languages presumably continued to be spoken (as the Seleucids allowed local religious cults to continue practicing without imposed Hellenistic influences [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrSeleu], but the textual bias is towards Greek written documents.<b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Hellenistic Religions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ Seleucid Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The Seleucid Empire arose in the years following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and the subsequent division of his empire. Alexander’s generals each ruled part of the empire, including Seleucus I who became leader of the Babylonian territory in 319 BCE as a reward for having helped Alexander eliminate the regent Perdiccas [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrSeleu]. This date does not however mark the start of the Seleucid Empire as Seleucus was ousted by the rival Antigonus in 315 BCE and did not return to power until 312 BCE, after which the Seleucid Empire truly began as Seleucus began to extent his domain to create an empire large enough to include territories in the Central Asian steppe to European Thrace [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrSeleu]. Seleucus’ territorial achievements were matched by only one of his successors, Antiochus III, whose rule began 60 years later. The last rulers of the empire could not match the charisma and drive of these earlier rulers, especially in the face of growing powers to the west and east of the empire (Rome and Parthia respectively). The empire declined in size and influence until it was taken over by Rome in 63 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Seleucid Empire continued to exert the Hellenistic influences of Alexander the Great’s empire, but like Alexander, the rulers of the Seleucid Empire generally allowed other religions and languages to continue and flourish (a notable exception being the persecution of the Jews by Antiochus IV) [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IrSeleu]. Most written documents are in Greek and contain valuable information about the empire, the battles fought and the kings who ruled. The documents are however far from complete and many aspects of the empire are either inferred from other sources or remain unknown. Overall it can be surmised that the Seleucid Empire was ruled by one king at a time who held central authority, but who exerted that authority through his commanders, or satraps, in the various territories of the empire [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrSeleu]. This both gave the king a great amount of power but also made him vulnerable to the ambitions of his satraps, the most notable example being the betrayal of the general Achaios who in 220 BCE took the territories of Asia Minor for himself after conducting campaigns there on behalf of Antiochus III [MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Seleucids ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Seleucid_300BCE: 312BCE-201BCE; Seleucid_200BCE: 200BCE-101BCE; Seleucid_100BCE: 100BCE-63BCE ♥</b>  Seleucid_100BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrSeleu] Seleucid_200BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IrSeleu] Seleucid_300BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IrSeleu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  2742225: 312BCE-201BCE;  2234817: 200BCE-101BCE;  79996: 100BCE-63BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Graeco-Phrygian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Greek ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Ancient Mediterranean Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Ancient Graeco-Phrygian Paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Zoroastrianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Alice Williams; Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IrSeleu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 3,600,000: 312-201 BCE; [2,300,000-475,000]: 200-147 BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers.

EC coded most widespread and most frequent, and edited remaining rituals.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The ritual system of the Seleucid Period is a complicated mix of long standing Mesopotamian tradition and Hellenistic influence from the Seleucid rule, with a significant presence of Zoroastrianism that remained from the time of the Achaemenids. Macedonian Seleucid rulers encouraged the integration of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian gods, while the same families and administrative structures remained in power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_208_IrSeleu] Rituals took place in temples and probably in private dwellings. Temples were homes to gods and their servants and families. They were not open to the whole public but were the home of the larger rituals and festivals. Everyday private ritual probably took place in homes, thus there is much less written information about them. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_IrSeleu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There was a pantheon of gods across Mesopotamia. The most important god, who might be considered the official cult, varied over time and between cities. At Babylon the Esaglia temple complex of the Bel-Marduk cult remained the most important in the Seleucid period, at Uruk Anu became the foremost deity, taking over from Ishtar. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_210_IrSeleu][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Rituals were carried out by a number of priests with specialised roles. There was the exorcist (asipu) who was in charge of averting evil and purifying rituals. Further priests include the singer (naru) and the lamentation priest (kalu).

There is not enough information to suggest whether the ritual changed in any major or minor way in the Seleucid period compared to previous times, but due to the limited availability of information the ritual is coded using sources from earlier times. The ceremony included celebratory feasting, elaborate parades of the gods through the city and singing. It probably focused around the sacred wedding of the king, possibly to one of the gods, and was a ritualised legitimisation of kingship. There is no evidence to confirm this occurred in the Seleucid period, but it would have been a useful tool of cementing Seleucid rule.

There was no higher collective authority, as under the Achaemenid government. We have therefore to imagine regional differences in the practice of the religion. the <i>magi</i> were accordingly responsible for the way in which the religion developed: they had a monopoly on religious tradition. This had far-reaching consequences, for the joyful and affirmative faith which we recognize in Zarathustra's own hymns was altered and made more prescriptive and rigorous. It now became a question of exacting observation of very strict rules, and there were extreme penalties for any violation. [...] It is reasonable for us to conclude that in the course of Seleucid times the <i>magi</i> established an extensive web of temples of fire, even if they have not been found, thereby creating firm centers for the practice of religion; and this must have been important at a time when the prevailing powers were quite unconcerned with the preservation of Iranian religion. The observance of temples of fire had become as far spread as Asia Minor, as we learn, for example, in Strabo (4.1.3a): 'In Cappadocia (for there the seat of the magi, who are also called firekindlers, is large) ... they ... have fire temples, noteworthy enclosures; and in the midst of these there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes, and where the magi keep the fire ever burning. And there, entering daily, they make incantations for about an hour, holding before the fire their bundles of rods and wearing round their heads high turbans of felt (that is, the tiara) which reach down over their cheeks far enough to cover their lips.'" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_252_IrSeleu] The ritual described by Strabo is almost certainly the Yasna, which is the central ritual of Zoroastrianism [MAJIDBENAM_REF_253_IrSeleu]. Schwartz writes that it was "the act of worship par excellence, in which, in addition to the other elements of religious service, the beverage haoma, in Achaemenian times probably still a hallucinogen, was prepared in a mortar, strained and offered. A long liturgy, including recitation of the Gathas, was structured around this act" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_254_IrSeleu]. Though Schwarz does not mention animal sacrifice specifically in connection with the Yasna ritual, he does list it in a preceding paragraph among "[t]he ancient canon of elements of cultic worship", and may therefore be considered to be implied "the other elements of religious service" in the above quote, also because the general consensus is that animal sacrifice was en everyday part of Zoroastrian ritual, since the days of Zarathustra himself [MAJIDBENAM_REF_255_IrSeleu].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "The observance of temples of fire had become as far spread as Asia Minor, as we learn, for example, in Strabo (4.1.3a): 'In Cappadocia (for there the seat of the magi, who are also called firekindlers, is large) ... they ... have fire temples, noteworthy enclosures; and in the midst of these there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes, and where the magi keep the fire ever burning.

Only the barest outlines can be detected from the sources: unlike the Achaemenid and Ptolemaic kings, the Seleucids never listed their territorial possessions in royal inscriptions or encomiastic poetry, and historiographical sources privilege the untypical crisis moments of war or revolt. Even so, it is clear that the Seleucid kingdom arranged its political landscape according to an imperial geography largely inherited from Alexander and the Achaemenids. Satrapies (large territorial blocks with some degree of ethnic or cultural identity organized around a capital city), governed by satraps or generals (strategoi), formed the basic administrative reference points. In the third century, the core satrapies east of the Tigris were Susiana, Media, Persis, Parthia-Hyrcania, Carmania, Gedrosia, and Bactria (Bengtson 1944:18). Recall that the easternmost satrapies of Alexander's empire - Gandhara, Paropamisadaa, Areia, and parts of Arachosia - had been handed over to Chandragupta Maurya in the Treaty of the Indus (Mookerji 1995:12 and Foucher 1942: 208 contra Tarn 1951: 100 and Schmitt 1964: 66, n. 4).

Moreover, at various moments Armenia, Media Atropatene, and Parthia were reduced to a state of vassalage.

But clearly adapted traditional Persia /Zoroastrian traditions for their Persian subjects and based rule (at least in part) on adherence to and legitimation from divine authority. Similar phenomenon as ocurred at same time in Ptolemaic Egypt. "The Achaemenians proclaimed that they were Persians, and received the realm from the supreme god Ahuramazda. Later the Sasanian clergy taught that the kingdom and the(true) religion were twins.2 The Seleucids were of Macedonian stock, but they neither ruled over Macedonia nor had any authority over Macedonians abroad,3 and they commanded peoples not "by the grace of God", but by the right of the spear. They were neither native rulers, nor the instruments of a "colonial" power, but just lucky condottieri. Their power was not institutional but personal." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_556_IrSeleu] "In return, the Greeks honored the kings as divine ‘saviors’ (sōtēres), awarding them divine honors accordingly. From the reign of Antiochos III onward, a centralized state cult of the deified king and queen was institutionalized. The Seleucid family claimed descent from the savior god Apollo. For the sake of the non-Greek subjects, Apollo and his twin sister Artemis were equated with the various local Sun and Moon gods worshipped in the multi-polytheistic empire. Starting with the reign of Antiochus IV, the Seleucids associated their rule with the cosmic kingship of Zeus, who could likewise be identified with non-Greek sky gods."

It is possible that the example of Ptolemy II Philadelphus had some influence in the case of Antiochus II whose title Theos cannot have been just an empty word; and although this kind of deification was at first only a local phenomenon (in Miletus), his coins none the less depict Hercules on the rock, Apollo on the omphalos and the horned horse's head - now heraldically stylized. By contrast, Seleucus II Callinicus made virtually no attempt to spread his own cult but was active in encouraging the cult of Apollo and Athene; moreover he combined the cult of the dead queen Stratonice Thea with that ofher protectress Aphrodite. He did not have his own title put on his coins. Neither did Seleucus III Soter and Antiochus III the Great, who stamped the image of Apollo or an elephant on the reverse of their coins - the elephant here having nothing to do with Indian theories of monarchy.2 Even more striking is the absence of any charismatic or mythical references in the consolidation of the dynastic cult under Antiochus III. Only one decree is compiled on the assumption that the kings but not the queens had cults in their lifetime, that from Antioch in Persis3 which lists with their usual titles all the kings from Seleucus I to Antiochus III (together with his eldest son)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_561_IrSeleu] "On the basis of these facts we must give a decidedly negative answer to the question of whether the Seleucid kings adopted charismatic conceptions of monarchy from their subjects for reasons that relate to religion as a political force or even whether they believed themselves to be personally legitimized by the xvarnah through which Achaemenian kings had exercised world dominion on behalf of Ahura Mazda. Of the statements which can be made about the ancient Iranian or Aryan kings, not a single one applies to the Seleucids.

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor - it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_582_IrSeleu]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Slavery">Normative Ideological Aspects of Slavery</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IrSeleu&amp;action=edit&amp;section=69" title="Edit section: Normative Ideological Aspects of Slavery">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery for co-ethnics ♣ absent ♥</b> “I am not aware of any explicit condemnation of slavery as an institution by any ancient philosopher, nor any movement, large or small, to abolish slavery.

It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity.

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor - it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_620_IrSeleu] Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b>  “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_621_IrSeleu] Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “It depends on what kind of authority. The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_622_IrSeleu] Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As I have suggested at the beginning of this paper, the idea that a ritually cleaned body cannot free a person from guilt and cannot be a sufficient requirement for a harmonious relationship between mortals and immortals can be understood as an implicit criticism of rituals. We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_623_IrSeleu] Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Piety required respect for one’s parents, especially in regard to making the annual offerings once they were dead. To mistreat a parent or neglect a parental tomb was a sign of moral depravity. Greek city-states legislated that children owed their parents food, lodging and burial (this goes back to Solon, the first lawgiver at Athens); those who failed in this duty could have their citizenship rights revoked. The worst crimes imaginable were incest with a parent and killing one’s own parent. Killing one’s own child did not carry the same weight of horror, although any kin-murder was considered more serious than murder of non-kin. The expectations for ritual purification after killing made these types of distinctions, and they could be regarded as a form of “regulation.” The Greeks recognized both written and unwritten laws. In general, the need to obey and respect parents was much, much stronger than any parental obligation to a child. Greek fathers throughout antiquity had the right to “expose” offspring they rejected at birth, which meant abandoning the infant either in the wild or in a place known to be used for that purpose, where it might or might not be picked up by slave traders. This did not count as murder, although once the infant was acknowledged by the father and accepted into the household, that would be a different matter. The Kyrene religious law code of the 4th century BCE says that “a man is bound as far as his brother’s children,” meaning that religious obligation (such as paying a fine levied for religious offense on a nephew) extended that far, and only on the paternal side.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_624_IrSeleu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Yes, this was definitely a “promoted value.” The Greeks called it either andreia (lit. “manliness”) or arete(“excellence”). A boy’s first school text was the Iliad, and he had to memorize long passages and write them out (or suffer beatings). As you know, this text is much concerned with the display of manly prowess in combat, which was the ultimate test of andreia. Evidence of cowardice (such as wounds taken in the back, or throwing away a shield in order to run) could ruin a man’s reputation in life or death. Plutarch wrote a book “On the Arete of Women,” in which he describes women who behaved in unexpectedly brave ways (usually by showing physical courage, fighting invaders, or counseling their men against cowardice). Some citations from the Hellenistic author Polybius: 5.111: King Attalus brought Gauls over from Europe as mercenaries because of their reputation for andreia. 6.46: [Citing unnamed sources] ‘For [they say that there are] two things on which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—andreia in the face of the enemy and concord at home.’ 27.8 [Deliberations by the Macedonian general Perseus after a victory]: ‘after this taste of Macedonian andreia, the Romans will be much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or harsh burden upon the Macedonians.’” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_625_IrSeleu]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “I recommend the chapter “Greek law in the Hellenistic period” in M. Gagarin ed. The Cambridge Companion to Greek Law (2005). There is also a chapter on family and property law.

First cousin, half-sibling and uncle-niece marriages were permitted or even required for heiresses, in order to keep property within the paternal family. The Romans noticed this Greek habit of endogamy and disapproved of it. Daniel Ogden’s bookGreek Bastardy may also be of help here.

Much of Iran relied on qanats, underground tunnels to save on evapora- tion, leading from aquifers to the land to be irrigated.34 The Persian king had controlled many of these, if not all, and charged a price for their use (Hdt. 3.117; Polyb. 10.28).

The Thessalian military settlers in Larissa (Syria) received their land from the Seleukid kings “because of their bravery” (ep andreia; Diod. 33.4a). The commander of the Ptolemaic garrison at Philai proudly mentions in a dedication he made that he was given a distinc- tion during the visit of Ptolemy IX (SEG XXVIII 1429). Aristodikides of Assos was one of the “friends” of Antiochos I, to whom the king gave land in the Hellespontine satrapy (ca. 275 BC; Savalli-Lestrade 1998: 11-12; Bagnall and Derow 2004: no. 18). The king explains his motivation in his letters to the governor: “because being our friend he has rendered his services with all goodwill and zeal” (RC 11); “seeing that he is benevolent and zealous in our interest we are anxious to favor the man highly” (RC 12). Such phrases not only honor the recipient of the gift, but also encourage other officers to demonstrate analogous zeal and goodwill. A letter sent by Seleukos IV to Seleukeia in Pieria concerning honors for one of his father’s veterans (RC 45, 186 BC) reinforces this point: “Aristolochos, one of the ‘honored friends,’ has rendered his services with all good-will to our father and our brother and ourself, and has at the most critical times given splendid demonstrations of his attitude towards our affairs”; the “critical times” (anankaiotatoi kairoi) are the uninterrupted wars of Antiochos III, who had recently died before he had a chance to reward Aristolochos.

The mercenaries wanted to make sure that this person would be the next relative or a person designated by the soldier in his will, and not, for example, an officer.

Generals could and did change sides and become governors of provinces (e.g. Ptolemaios, Document 4) and, perhaps, this is an indication of pay scales of senior officials in the Seleukid empire as well.[...] Milns calculates a cost of 2,200-4,800 talents per year for the mixed phalanx and 6,000 talents per year for 100,000 mercenaries, paid at the rate of 1 drachm per day. He also adds 30-50 per cent for food and overheads. This would give a total of more than 10,000-15,000 talents a year (1987: 254). Cavaignac estimates that a 100,000-man army would cost 6,000 talents a year (1951: 142). Cavaignac also puts the cost of a fleet of the period, consisting of eighty or ninety ships, at about 2,000 talents per year (1923: 118). However, for many officials a large part of their earnings, and perhaps even all, may have been indirect, from the land granted to them by the king, while they remained in office or even afterwards. One does not know what services Mnesimachos had rendered, but following the argument in chapter 8.1a and e, his own revenue from the land grant may have amounted to about 30 drachms per day. Aristodikides’ land grant (Document 2) ulti- mately contained 5,500 plethra of mostly cultivable land, or about 500 hectares, roughly equal in fact to the estimated cultivable area of one of Mnesimachos’ two main villages and so perhaps yielding half his revenue. By way of comparison, a governor of the minor Achaemenid province of Judaea earned 40 (Persian) shekels daily from ‘the satrap’s table’ (Nehemiah 5.15-17), equivalent to about 50 drachms.These are isolated rates of pay, which really give only an indication of what some administrative personnel of a satrapy may have cost. So, to arrive at a total cost of the provincial administration, one is reduced to ‘educated speculation’.The financial and, indirectly, civil administration of a satrapy is discussed in chapter 13. Let us assume that the chief officers of a satrapy, the strate ̄gos and the dioike ̄te ̄s, received half of Skopas’ daily pay, namely 500 drachms.50 Each of the twenty or so satrapies of the empire at its peak may have been divided into three or four hyparchies or oikonomiai, on average.51 Let us assume that the hyparch and the oikonomos were each paid 50 drachms per day, half the salary of Skopas’ officers. Garrison commanders are not taken into account, as their pay has been considered part of military expenditure, but there were other senior officials in a satrapy, such as one or more eklogistai (‘tax assessors’), probably an epi to ̄n hiero ̄n (‘supervisor of the sanctuaries’) and certainly epistatai (‘supervisors’) for some cities (ch. 13.4-7). Again, let us assume that each of these middle-level officials earned 50 drachms per day.So, two chief officers and about ten at the next level made up the ‘senior management’ of a satrapy and may have cost up to 1,500 drachms per day or roughly 90 talents per year. At least one large satrapy (Koile Syria) pos- sessed intermediate administrative subdivisions, the meridarchies, with a meridarch and a dioike ̄te ̄s in command of each, which would have increased their cost (ch. 13.5a). So, for twenty satrapies in the empire at its peak, the total annual cost of senior personnel works out at about 2,000 talents, although a substantial part of this may have effectively been covered by land grants (from which the king could even expect taxation revenue in silver). At more junior levels of the administration, individual personnel costs would have been appreciably lower, probably nearer the 0.5-1 drachm daily pay of the average soldier. Taking into account other expenses of the satrapies that could not be met by requisitions or corve ́e labour, the total cost of the provincial administration in silver may have been of the order of 2,000-3,000 talents annually at the empire’s peaks c. 281 or 190 bc, purely based on ‘educated speculation’."

There is no knowing what the prices may have been in the intervening years, but they are also likely to have been high, in the climate of war and uncertainty. If one ignores the affected years, however, one is left with an underlying price trend for barley which is surprisingly flat for 200 years, at about 120 litres for a shekel of silver, equivalent to 60 litres for an Attic drachm, which means that the price of an Attic medimnos of 51.8 litres would have been nearly 0.9 Attic drachms.65" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_691_IrSeleu] "Cereals were the staple of the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean diets, and in the Seleukid empire the main crop, as in mainland Greece at this time, seems to have been barley rather than wheat."

"The Persian king, we are told (Athenaios 4.145a), spent 20 or 30 talents or more a day for his maintenance, for which there is some confirmation in the huge quantities of commodities listed by Polyainos (4.3.32) for the ‘King’s dinner’.52 In both of these cases, it was clearly not only the king and his courtiers who wined and dined, but also that part of the army which was permanently attached to the court and travelled with it. On the assumption that half of the cost was borne by the army, the expenditure of the Persian king and his court would have amounted to about 5,000 talents annually. One cannot apply this directly to the court of the Seleukid king,53 of course, even if the figures were accurate. Nevertheless, to consider that the king spent 2,000-3,000 talents a year on himself and his entourage does not appear unreasonable, since, as part of the ideology of kingship, he was expected to give the impression of great wealth.54 For example, even at a time of financial strain after Magnesia (ch. 12.4), Antiochos IV could be regarded as surpassing all previous kings in his public displays (Livy 41.20)."
