This poverty of information probably suggests that no local Muslim chronicles were written, for the historian Ebn-e Bibi (d. after 1285) remarked that it was impossible to find information about Anatolia before the reign of Ḡiāṯ-al-Din Kayḵosrow (Ebn-e Bibi, 1956, p. 11)."

[...] This ideology accommodated three important elements according to which the Great Seljuq sultan was an autocratic monarch, the guardian of Islam and the Muslims, and the loyal ally and deputy of the Abbasid caliph. The resulting duties of the sultan were the support of the Sunni Abbasid caliph and the protection of Islam and Muslims against heresy and unbelievers. He was obliged to uphold Islamic law, ascertain that the Muslim lands prospered and that justice prevailed in them.

"Of Persian origin, Nawruz (No Roz; new day), the ancient Iranian festival of the New Year, survived the Arab conquest and continued to be celebrated in Islamic lands many centuries thereafter. Originally the first day of the Persian solar year, it corresponded with the spring vernal equinox, and the duration of its celebration was six days. Medieval Islamic sources give various (folkloric) explanations for the origins of Nawruz, which involve the mythical Persian Jamshid or the biblical patriarchs Abraham and King Solomon. No Roz was the day to wear new clothes and serve food of the new season. People used to rise early in the morning, go to wells and streams, draw water in vases, and pour it over them- selves or sprinkle it on each other. Explanations for these customs varied, from considering them a good omen and a means to ward off harm to the cleansing of the smoke off of those attending the rituals of the fire of the preceding winter nights. Shi‘i explanation of the significance of Nawruz, which is ascribed to the Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq, sees in it the day of God’s primal covenant with mankind, the day of the first rising of the sun, the day of the defeat of the Antichrist, and the day of a number of other important events."

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives.

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives.

This can make polygamy necessary and practicable as a prevention and solution of the social problems which these unfortunate events would otherwise create. When these circumstances do not exist, polygamy ceases to flourish and monogamy is, as now, the norm. Moreover, even in these conditions, there is a further requirement of equity or justice mentioned in the Qur’an: ‘if you fear that you cannot deal justly (‘’with so many’’), then one only’ (4:3). Furthermore, we read in the same chapter of the Qur’an: ‘You will never be able to deal equally between (‘’your’’) wives, however much you may desire (‘’to do so’’)’ (4:129).’” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_254_TrRum**]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat).

[...] In the history of Islam, the first religious waqf was the mosque of Quba' in Medina. It was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad in 622. Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar.

Throughout human history, societal violence has been as prevalent as military violence, and in early seventh-century Arabia one finds numerous forms of societal violence. These included, for instance, female infanticide, along with the abuse of orphans, the poor, and marginal. Against such forms of societal violence, the revelations mediated through Muhammad were clear, incontrovertible challenges to the social order of tribal Mecca.

We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2; 8). In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice. This could be termed an advance in civilization. The Islamic interpretation comes close to this interpretation, as it makes this a founding myth for el eid.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_274_TrRum**] “If we begin in 611 rather than 9/11, the first expression of violence and Islam is not violence directed by or sanctified through Islam but rather violence against Muslims. Often that violence was a response to efforts by early Muslims to curtail pre-Islamic forms of violence. Throughout human history, societal violence has been as prevalent as military violence, and in early seventh-century Arabia one finds numerous forms of societal violence. These included, for instance, female infanticide, along with the abuse of orphans, the poor, and marginal. Against such forms of societal violence, the revelations mediated through Muhammad were clear, incontrovertible challenges to the social order of tribal Mecca. For instance, they prohibit the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of female infanticide as well as other bodily and social abuses through directives set down, transmitted, and encoded in the Qur’an."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_298_TrRum**][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Human Enforcement of Morality</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to care for the needy. "Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_299_TrRum**] "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_300_TrRum**] "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_301_TrRum**] "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_303_TrRum**] Moreover, justice is one of the key Islamic virtues: <i>In all their dealings, Muslims are required to stand firmly for justice even if it be against themselves or their kith and kin: 'O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)."

The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_308_TrRum**] In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void.

Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_310_TrRum**]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft. Traditional Islamic penal ordinances (hudud) distinguish between two kinds: al-sariqah al-sughra (simple theft), requiring amputation of the right hand, and al-sariqah al-kubra, the meaning of which is contested but which requires the amputation of the right hand and left foot. Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty. Hudud ordinances are considered primarily deterrant and, due to their strict evidentiary requirements, are rarely invoked."

The town qadi (appointed from jurists) at the mosque was the chief justice official. A market inspector, muhtasib, "was in law a subordinate of the qadi with special responsibility for public morals, the control of the non-Muslims, and above all for the smooth course of trade. This was the case throughout the Muslim world in the Seljukid period, and it is not surprising that the state of Rum adopted the institution." Towns, especially trade ones (e.g. ports) often had different quarters for different peoples (e.g. Greeks, Jews, Turks) but this was not always the case. The ikdish "formed a special corps under the command of a Muslim idisbasi or amir-i akadish, often the son of a native convert" who "carried out military operations of a local character. From this has arisen the belief that they were a military corps; but it seems that they were no more so than any police force or militia normally assigned simply to the maintenance of order in the city." They also collected and assessed urban taxes so were likely agents of general administration of a town. The term Ikdish meant crossbreed and referred to people who were half-Turkish and speculatively possibly also foreign converts and Christians trained to be soldiers (but this is not mentioned by Christians of the time). ”From the fourteenth century the word ikdis disappears in its social sense ... the ahis alone remained as the local police force.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_325_TrRum**]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Police levels ♣ [3-4] ♥</b>Sultan (1) Amir-i akadish or Idisbasi (2) Ikdish (3-4?).
