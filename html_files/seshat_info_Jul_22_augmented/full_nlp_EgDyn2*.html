[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_EgDyn2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣  ♥</b>The Second Dynasty of Egypt (c. 2900‒2687 BCE) was a relatively geographically constricted state, centred near the Nile delta of Egypt and extending as far south as Aswan and the First Cataract of the Nile. Founded by Hotepsekhemwy, the kings of the Second Dynasty initially ruled over a centralized state, but as the period progressed they had to contend with disorder and civil war that lasted until the last ruler, Khasekhemwy (c. 2714‒2687 BCE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_EgDyn2*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_EgDyn2*] The restoration of central authority after this period ushered in the classic Old Kingdom period, widely considered a high point of ancient civilization.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Controlled by a god-king who presided over an administration with specialized overseers,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_EgDyn2*] Memphis is considered the main administrative centre of the Early Dynastic period because tombs of administrative officials are located nearby.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_EgDyn2*] Also known as the White Walls,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_EgDyn2*] apparently after the colour of the palace enclosure walls,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_EgDyn2*] Memphis probably had at least 6,000 residents at a population density of 193 per hectare.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_EgDyn2*] The government of the Early Dynasties is thought to have developed significant divisions of labour and a more hierarchical structure under King Djer, who introduced permanent institutions,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_EgDyn2*] although Egyptologist Hratch Papazian stresses that a true hierarchical bureaucracy emerged 'only during the latter parts of the Old Kingdom'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_EgDyn2*] Writing in this period was now well established; it had been present since the late Predynastic period ('Dynasty 0'),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_EgDyn2*] when hieroglyphs were used for labels such as those found in the tomb of U-j at Abydos, dating to around 3150 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_EgDyn2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Regional centres of the Second Dynasty included Hierakonpolis, Abydos, and minor centres further south at Naga-el-Deir and Aswan. Evidence for a system of territorial organization comes from thousands of seal stamps discovered in the tomb of Khasekhemwy, the last king of the dynasty; they mention some historical provinces along with 'administrative titles and the names of the king'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_EgDyn2*] However, Second-Dynasty Egypt was likely not yet divided into the clearly demarcated provinces, controlled by local governors, that we find in later periods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_EgDyn2*] Abydos appears to have been the most significant cult centre. Its royal cemetery reveals the increasing elaboration of the ideology of kingship through the mortuary cult, and its monumental architecture has been interpreted as the expression of a 'state religion' on a grander scale than in previous periods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_EgDyn2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Egyptian population during the Early Dynastic period is difficult to determine, but the archaeologist Bruce Trigger estimated that there could have been over 2 million people living in the Nile Valley at this time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_EgDyn2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b> <i>these codes were reviewed at at the Seshat Workshop on Egyptian History, Oxford 2014</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgDyn2*&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 100,000: 2900-2801 BCE; 267,000: 2800-2701 BCE; 300,000: 2700-2651 BCE ♥</b> 100,000: 2900 BCE; 250,000: 2850 BCE; 267,000: 2800 BCE; 283,000: 2750 BCE; 300,000: 2700 BCE; 317,000: 2650 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_EgDyn2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]This includes only habitable area. we will have another that includes the desert (John Baines)JGM: We should bring up, somewhere, theories on the rise of the first state in Egypt in relations to the oases, western desert.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_EgDyn2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Ink inscriptions on vessels from the funerary complex of Pharaoh Djoser (about 2686-2667 BCE) and seal stamps from Elephantine dating from Dynasty III, reveal the existence of a network of royal agricultural centers(the Hwt-aAt being the most frequently attested whereas the Hwt are also mentioned) which coexisted with the pr “domains” of some individuals." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_EgDyn2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "The ink texts from another enormous set of vessels, recovered at Abydos and dating from the Second Dynasty, confirm this model as they mention institutions named after the element Hwt, like the Hwt-nbw or the Hwt-wr(t) (Regulski 2004). It seems that the territorial organization of the kingdom consisted of a duality of agricultural centers belonging to the crown. The first of these were the Hwt-aAt and Hwt, which were administered by royal officials called HoA Hwt-aAt and HoA Hwt. The second were the pr domains administered by individuals whose links to the royal administration are poorly understood, since it is impossible to determine if they were local magnates who exercised a personal control over the territorial units called pr or if they were royal agents in charge of the administration of these circumscriptions."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_EgDyn2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Another problem is our ignorance of the exact geographical distribution of these centers and circumscriptions: were they evenly scattered over the country or were they only prevalent in specific regions because of their strategic and/or economic importance? As regards this important question, our understanding of the role of provincial governors or of specific nome leaders is rather limited. Only the sSm tA played an active role as can be inferred from their frequent mention in the ink inscriptions, but it is impossible to ascertain the geographical extent of their authority or the scope of their activities (Moreno García 1999:233-38)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_EgDyn2*][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Other towns must have developed or been founded as administrative centres of the state throughout Egypt. ...

A successful hunt qualified the hunter as a leader and it especially legitimized the power of the ruler or king (as, for example, the royal hunts portrayed on the chest of Tutankhamun or the hunting scenes of Ramesses III in Medinet Habu). The importance of the hunt in qualifying the powers of Egypt's ruler resulted in an eventual reservation of the hunt as a privilege for the king. For example, during the height of the Old Kingdom, only the king was allowed to go hunting equipped with bow and arrow, and he had the reserved right to hunt specific game animals—above all the wild bull and the lion. Other instances of royal hunting privileges included the harpooning of the hippopotamus in the Nile Delta's marshes, bird-hunting with throw sticks in the papyrus thicket, and the spear-hunting of fish with two-pronged spears. "In the hunting scenes of private tombs from the Old Kingdom, the tomb owner was not shown as the hunter. He participated in the hunt only as a spectator, while the members of his household joined as helpers (for example, in leading the hounds, handling the bent sticks, or lassoing game). Only during the fifth dynasty do nonroyal tomb owners join actively in the hunt (the first documented examples being Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep in Saqqara), where the first depictions of fishing and of bird-hunting in the papyrus thicket were also found. The nonroyal tomb owner in his role as hunter was then given the same qualifying symbols as the ruler. The adaptation of royal hunting privileges for nonroyal tomb owners became evident toward the end of the Old Kingdom, when they were shown hunting with bow and arrow (the first known depiction is the rock tomb of Ankehtifi in Moʿalla). "The ritualistic interpretation of the hunt in ancient Egypt means that hunting was not considered a sport or recreation. An evaluation of hunting as a sport is possible only after the rituals have lost meaning; thus, during the Middle Kingdom, the king and his noble officials went hunting for the first time as a recreation. The concept of open and closed seasons for hunting was unknown to the Egyptians. In depictions of hunting scenes from the Old and the Middle Kingdom, the hunt was portrayed mostly in spring—in the mating season and when the young are born. "[...] "There is very little documentation for trapping in the historic period, in which animals were caught either dead or alive in traps, nets, pits, tight enclosures, and other manmade structures. In an Old Kingdom tomb, two lions were shown being transported in cages on sleighs, and they were probably caught by trapping. In the historic period, most hunts took place as a single-file ambush, in which hunters with varying types of equipment participated. Hounds (and probably hunting leopards) were also used. Many depictions document that the ambush took place in the flat, open landscape of the desert. Fences and nets were erected to close off the area on two sides, with lateral barricades set up parallel. From the opposite open sides, the hunters and beaters would approach with their hounds, herding the game with cries and by beating sticks. While the royal hunter shot the choicest game (wild bull and lion) with bow and arrow, the other participants fell upon the game with bent clubs, axes, or lassos; some caught it with bare hands. "[...] "The exaggerated accounts of royal prowess in the hunt cannot be taken as 'huntsman's slang,' because such accounts were written in order to praise the king. The victorious hunt of the king metaphorically made 'game' of Egypt's enemies, and they fled in horror from the attacking king. They also ran like 'herds of game' from the attacking ruler, it was said."

"The concept of imakhu ['honoured'] (which can also be translated as 'being provided for') was an expression of a remarkable moral dictum that ran through all levels of Egyptian society and that corrected the extreme cases of social inequality: it was the duty of a more influential and richer person to take care of the poor and socially disadvantaged in the same way the head of a family was responsible for all its members."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_260_EgDyn2*] "the association between ma'at and the just society finds expression in the Instructions of the vizier Ptah-hetep of the Fifth Dynasy: 'Justice (ma'at) is great, its value enduring. It has not been disturbed since the days of him who created it. He who transgresses the laws is punished."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_261_EgDyn2*] "But, perhaps, the most definitive expression of the king's acting like Ra is that he puts Maat in the place of isfet, its opposite. As the texts say: 'Heaven is at peace; earth is in joy. For they have heard the king has set right (in the place of wrong) (PT 1775) and 'Unas has come forth from the Island of Fire. Unas has set Maat in it in the place of isfet' (PT 265). The putting of Maat in the place of isfet or replacing evil with good is fundamental to both royal and later general human responsibility. Thus the Pyramid Texts establish the basis of moral justification. ... In the Pyramid Texts, then, Maat is a moral claim for justification before history and heaven, humanity and God by the king. This moral claim is at the same time the core of the claim which legitimates the king's rule ... Bergman calls Maat 'the fundamental state myth'".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_262_EgDyn2*] In the Old Kingdom: "First, Maat is established as a moral order with divine, natural and social dimensions. Secondly, Maat is counterposed with isft (evil, chaos, wrong-doing) as well as with dw (evil), grg (falsehood) and 3bt (wrong-doing). Thirdly, Maat is a standard and measure of both moral life on the personal and social level. Fourthly, Maat is tied to the concept of moral and social excellence (ikr, mnh) and resultant worthiness (im3h). Finally, the ground of Maat is that it's God's will, and thus the king's will and that it is good, effective and life-giving."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_263_EgDyn2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ unknown ♥</b>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_EgDyn2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ communal dining ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ morality ♣ inferred present ♥</b> In Old Kingdom clearly present. "Central to the Egyptians' views of kingship was the concept of ma'at which, whilst sometimes translatable as 'justice' or 'truth', is a term whose meaning goes far beyond legal fairness or factual accuracy. It was used to refer to the ideal state of the universe and society, and was personified as the goddess Ma'at. Although of eternal existence its operation in the world of men was the responsibility of the king, and as such must have acted as a constraint on the arbitrary exercise of power: a 'natural' morality in place of institutional checks."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_265_EgDyn2*] These ideas seem to have existed by beginning of the 3rd millenium [MAJIDBENAM_REF_266_EgDyn2*]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Slavery">Normative Ideological Aspects of Slavery</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgDyn2*&amp;action=edit&amp;section=68" title="Edit section: Normative Ideological Aspects of Slavery">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery for co-ethnics ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> 'No evidence for ideological against slavery'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_267_EgDyn2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery for co-religionists ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> 'No evidence for ideological against slavery'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_268_EgDyn2*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> 'No evidence for ideological against slavery'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_269_EgDyn2*]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Human_Sacrifice">Normative Ideological Aspects of Human Sacrifice</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgDyn2*&amp;action=edit&amp;section=69" title="Edit section: Normative Ideological Aspects of Human Sacrifice">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ [4-5] ♥</b> Inferred continuity from the 1st Dynasty: "The next tomb in which there is any sacrificial servant burial evidence is that of the last king of the Second Dynasty, Khasekhemwy. When it was excavated, the state of preservation in his Abydos Tomb 5 was poor, and it had been looted extensively. Nevertheless, it is apparent that it had contained between ten and fifteen subsidiary burials.59 Reisner found two individuals that he felt were probably examples of sacrificial servant burials, noting that the state of the tomb made it impossible to locate other specific burials.60 As with Abydos Tomb 10, the weight of the pattern in other rulers’ tombs forces historians to conclude that Tomb 5 was at least possibly the site of sacrificial servant burials. Khasekhemwy Khasekhemwy is the final king for whom we find evidence of sacrificial servant burial.61 Thus, our task is to now summarize the findings and draw conclusions. Of the fifteen tombs containing subsidiary graves as part of the original structure, six include nearly irrefutable evidence that retainers were buried with the tomb owner. Two others contain almost certain evidence that retainers were buried simultaneously with the tomb owners, and two more hold very likely evidence of such burials. In three cases, the architecture yields inconclusive indications, and the state of preservation of two others makes an estimation impossible. This gives us eight solid examples of sacrificial servant burial, and seven which may or may not be. While the array of numbers representing sacrificial servant burial is somewhat confusing (Kemp’s numbers will be used in the charts in chapter 9), the cumulative weight of the evidence definitely indicates that sacrificial servant burial was a real and consistent part of royal burial practice. The recent work by O’Connor greatly strengthens this conclusion: since decisive evidence for sacrificial servant burial stems from the first two and nearly last two tombs with subsidiary burials, it very strongly suggests— indeed, almost mandates—that the subsidiary graves between the two temporal terminals would also have been part of this practice. This conclusion is further augmented by scholarly reasoning about the Egyptian ideological basis for conducting such a practice.

Fate in one’s afterlife was judged based on how well one followed the code of maat (“what is right”; e.g. protecting the weak, no cheating/theft). "Re is the sun god. His Egyptian name, rʿ, is usually written with the sun disk. He is often called “Re-Horakhty” (“Re [is] Horus of the Horizon”); this should be understood as a surname describing the character of the god. Re was the most important god of the Egyptian pantheon because he created the world. [...] For the Egyptians, the course of the sun was the measurement of time. After its nightly absence, it rose again on the horizon with absolute regularity. The rising sun was the symbol for the creation of the world, and the daily course of the sun the symbol of the world's cyclical renewal; hence the paramount importance of Re as creator and master of life."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_300_EgDyn2*] "In all levels of the divine hierarchy and throughout Egyptian society there existed the unifying concept of balance and harmony. The creation myths describe the earliest periods in the memory of humankind as pure chaos.
