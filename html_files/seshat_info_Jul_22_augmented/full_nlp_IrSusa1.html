Khuzistan, Susiana, the Soghun Valley of the southeastern plateau, and perhaps elsewhere, Late Chalcolithic society may have been made up of a series of small localized chiefdoms similar to the

These chiefdoms would have been based on a system of staple finance rather than on the unequal distribution of prestige items. In this case, power would have been based on the control over water, land, and labor. Elsewhere, especially in the more isolated regions of the highlands, relatively small, self-sufficient, autonomous villages probably continued to exist throughout the Late Chalcolithic."

Whatever the raison d’être behind Susa’s foundation, and it may have been very mundane indeed, the site’s subsequent development was soon distinguished by a number of architectural developments which would seem to exceed the scope of activities normally associated with village life (Dollfus 1985: 18-19)."

However, the basic mode of living at this time was in agricultural villages and herding camps so the urban aspect should not be exaggerated. The "Urban Revolution" was to come c3800-3000 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrSusa1] This was a time when centers developed to a larger scale than before[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrSusa1], and increased - if still incipient - centralization with the emergence of elite houses, whilst the societies as a whole maintained a "strong egalitarian appearance".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Prior to the foundation of Susa part of the existing site of Choga Mish was burned and villages surrounding Susa were abandoned, but archaeologists have not yet settled on an explanation why this occurred.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrSusa1] Susa, which replaced Choga Mish as the biggest settlement in the region, is noted for its comparatively great size compared to surrounding settlements with about 1000 people in the 15-18 hectare urban area, which consisted of non-contiguous groups of houses.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrSusa1] Hole (1987) estimates there were 10,000 people in the region of Susiana.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Despite the low population density Susa soon after its foundation became "distinguished by a number of architectural developments which would seem to exceed the scope of activities normally associated with village life".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IrSusa1] most notably a stepped platform.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrSusa1] Many archaeologists are, however, reluctant to infer from the impressive temple constructions that Susa was a 'ceremonial centre' or to suggest it was politically organized as a chiefdom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrSusa1] Administrative conventions and writing are known to have developed in the later Uruk period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]There is nevertheless obvious evidence of a central authority in terms of the organization and hoarding of goods. Excavations at Susa discovered may stamp seals and sealings from the Susa I period, some of which may have been used on locked doors. This implies an authority existed "to control the flow of goods in and out of one or more offices or centres of redistribution."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Earliest and latest radiocarbon 14 dates for Susa are about 4400-3900 BCE and 3700-3500 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrSusa1] Tepe Jaffarabad, which is analogue in terms of ceramics, has been radiocarbon dated 4100-3900 BCE and 3900-3700 BCE and "thus generally consistent with the Susa dates"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrSusa1] - at least for the period from 4100-3700 BCE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner; Agathe Dupeyron ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IrSusa1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 1 ♥</b> in squared kilometers. ha based on calculation with value of 200 persons per hectare. “By various estimates, the size of the settled population in the Late Village Period is between 8,500 and 25,000.

For practical purposes these regions both appear to have been essentially emptied of people by the end of this period. By now, the mordern climatic regime was established, giving, if anything, enhanced opportunity for the spread of villages into newly favorable areas. But what we see is not expansion, but a general contraction as it is expressed in the numbers of sites."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR] “By various estimates, the size of the settled population in the Late Village Period is between 8,500 and 25,000.

First, it implies that estimates of population based on total numbers of sites on the plain are inherently suspect and probably too high, because sites are founded and abandoned through time and not all sites of a phase are occupied simultaneously.  […] Even at peak density during  the Susiana Period, there were probably fewer than ten inhabitants per square kilometre, an area that might support several times that many by agriculture (Adams and Nissen 1972: 29)" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IrSusa1][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "Since Susa stood alone, perforce it must have possessed sole responsibility for all of Susiana, a region in which 10,000 or more people may have resided in a multitude of separate communities."

Other sites, for the most part, are therefore residential and nonelite.

A site of this type would be Jaffarabad during the Choga Mish Phase when it consisted solely of ceramic kilns.  Depending on the distribution of raw products and the development of market proclivities, there might have been a large number of such specialist sites which could, of course, have occurred at residential villages and herding camps as well. Finally, we must consider the pastoral component.

The walls of the building, which were only preserved to a height of 1.15 m, were nevertheless 2.10 m thick. The thickness of the walls (compare this with the .4-.6 m thick walls at the ‘rural hamlet’ of Tepe Djafarrabad, Wright and Johnson 1985: 25) and the unusual interior lay- out of the rooms have led Steve and Gasche to interpret the Susa I Building as something more than a ‘simple private habitation’. On the other hand, the fact that a grave of the following Susa II period was dug into the building suggests that neither it nor the immediate environs were part of a religious precinct. Rather, Steve and Gasche are more inclined to view this as the residence of a ‘chief’ of the settlement of Susa, a seat of civil authority, in contrast to what they interpret as a seat of religious power on the Acropole (Steve and Gasche 1990: 22). Whatever its function, it is clear that the Susa I building was not founded when Susa itself was established, for it stood on c. 2.5 m of earlier archaeological strata of the Susa I period.

In Uruk phase development could be linked to the emergence of large-scale activities of great organizations in relation to surplus, wages, services and commodities which "easily superceded interactions on a village and family level. The enlarged scale of these interactions made the older means of interaction through habit and personal acquaintances inadequate. In other words, a more objective and impersonal system was needed in order ensure and guarantee that exchange would remain constant in every direction. This brought to the development of counting and measuring systems, and systems meant to give a concrete value to commodities, labour, time and land."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_IrSusa1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Geometrical ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Other ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Nonwritten records ♣ present ♥</b> Excavations at Susa have discovered many stamp seals and sealings dating from the Susa I period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_IrSusa1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Written records ♣ absent ♥</b> "The great organisations of the first phase of urbanisation rose to prominence without writing.

When selecting the relevant ritual do keep in mind that we are foremost interested in rituals containing the highest intensity of dysphoria even though they may contain other elements that are less emotional or even euphoric. Furthermore, we are interested in peak levels of dysphoria for participants or ritual specialists (not the audience or sacrificial victims). Also, as we are interested in how these dysphoric moments are remembered it is necessary for the participants not normally to die during the rituals. If there are several collective rituals with the same high levels of peak dysphoria, code the best documented one.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ ♥</b> In the narrative part, also give a brief description of the ritual</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ ♥</b> daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/once per generation/once in a lifetime.
