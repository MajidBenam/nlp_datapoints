For one thing, this region was something of a backwater for most of its prehistory, which means that whatever evidence there is for ritual activity is usually too scarce to be very useful from a Seshat point of view. Secondly, even if we coded generic "Hopewell" rituals (which is what we're doing, on the basis that the Havana Hopewell neighboured the American Bottom at this time [MAJIDBENAM_REF_212_USMisMW]), most of what is known about Hopewell ritual is heavily skewed towards mortuary customs. However, based on their size, the likely high status of the people buried underneath them, and the likely evidence for feasting associated with them, it does seem reasonable to infer that the rituals the Hopewell people carried out on or near mounds were sufficiently large-scale and culturally important to be of interest to Seshat.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Charnel houses were designed both to shelter the dead and the burial activities associated with them. The bodies of the deceased were subjected to considerable preparation, preparation that may have reflected the status of the dead. These structures and the rituals associated with them required the status of the dead. These structures and the rituals associated with them required much more effort by the communities associated with them. [...] Once the charnel houses had fulfilled their role, they were burnt to the ground and an earthen mound erected over them [...].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"[...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"We know almost nothing about Hopewell funerary rituals, for archaeological traces of such activities have not been preserved, except in frequent scatters of broken animal bones associated with the charnel houses, perhaps the remains of meals consumed nearby. Our only analogies are far-removed at best, and come from European-influenced Southeastern societies of centuries later.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Charnel houses were in widespread use in the Southeast as European contact, some of them restricted in use to the elite. Those of the Choctaw, however, were accessible to all members of society. Choctaw chiefs were often buried in a special house, but there were others for everyone else, probably controlled by different kin groups (Swanton, 1931). Among the Choctaw, the dead were placed on covered platforms in the open with special food offerings. When the flesh had decomposed some months later, the deceased's relatives called in fellow clan members, priestly specialists who defleshed the bones and placed them in a chest. A communal feast followed, a ceremony when the bones were deposited in the charnel house. The burial remained in the charnel house for some time, commemorated at regular ceremonies and feasts. Eventually, sometimes when the charnel house was full, the bones were ceremonially removed and interred. The regular feasts associated with mortuary ceremonies and charnel houses may have served a practical role in Choctaw society, to ensure redistribution of game meat and other foods throughout society, to compensate for periods of scarcity, perhaps to stimulate production.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Superficially, Choctaw burial customs seem to parallel those found under Hopewell mounds quite closely (Seeman, 1979b). Both sets of customs involved a sequence of exposure, defleshing, sometimes cremation, redepositing of the dead in charnel houses, and reinterment in burial mounds. If the animal bones found under many Hopewell mounds are the remains of meals, then mortuary customs may also have provided a context for redistribution of food supplies. But there are significant differences as well. Hopewell people relied more heavily on cremation, placed great importance on exotic artefacts and materials in burial furniture, and destroyed their charnel houses when they were full.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"To suggest that Hopewell and Choctaw burial customs were identical, that we can use historic custom in a straightforward manner to interpret mortuary remains from much earlier times, is the height of folly. Rather, as Mark Seeman argues (1979b), Hopewell charnel houses may have served as a catalyst for local chieftains to manage food resources, not only the increasing yield from native plant gardens, but also game meat, food that flowed into the charnel house as offerings and was redistributed at feasts and other ceremonies. Perhaps, too, local Hopewell leaders were reinforced in their political and ritual authority, for, as is well known from societies all over the world, chiefdoms obtain their political power from their spiritual authority, perhaps, in this case, an authority intimately associated with game animals, the wild creatures depicted so frequently  in Hopewell art and commemorated with dance masks and other artifacts.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"It should be stressed, however, that Hopewell is a phenomenon rather than a widespread culture within finite boundaries. There may have been ritual and exchange links between neighboring population concentrations in Ohio, Illinois, and further afield. The underlying culture was always local, displaying a variety of adaptations and local variations, many of them in communities that had never seen a Hopewell earthwork or given support to a 'Big Man.'"

For one thing, this region was something of a backwater for most of its prehistory, which means that whatever evidence there is for ritual activity is usually too scarce to be very useful from a Seshat point of view. Secondly, even if we coded generic "Hopewell" rituals (which is what we're doing, on the basis that the Havana Hopewell neighboured the American Bottom at this time [MAJIDBENAM_REF_223_USMisMW]), most of what is known about Hopewell ritual is heavily skewed towards mortuary customs. However, based on their size, and the likely high status of the people buried underneath them, it does seem reasonable to infer that the rituals the Hopewell people carried out on or near mounds were sufficiently culturally important to be of interest to Seshat--and the likely evidence for feasting associated with them does make them the most euphoric Hopewell rituals that we are aware of today.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Charnel houses were designed both to shelter the dead and the burial activities associated with them. The bodies of the deceased were subjected to considerable preparation, preparation that may have reflected the status of the dead. These structures and the rituals associated with them required the status of the dead. These structures and the rituals associated with them required much more effort by the communities associated with them. [...] Once the charnel houses had fulfilled their role, they were burnt to the ground and an earthen mound erected over them [...].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"[...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"We know almost nothing about Hopewell funerary rituals, for archaeological traces of such activities have not been preserved, except in frequent scatters of broken animal bones associated with the charnel houses, perhaps the remains of meals consumed nearby. Our only analogies are far-removed at best, and come from European-influenced Southeastern societies of centuries later.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Charnel houses were in widespread use in the Southeast as European contact, some of them restricted in use to the elite. Those of the Choctaw, however, were accessible to all members of society. Choctaw chiefs were often buried in a special house, but there were others for everyone else, probably controlled by different kin groups (Swanton, 1931). Among the Choctaw, the dead were placed on covered platforms in the open with special food offerings. When the flesh had decomposed some months later, the deceased's relatives called in fellow clan members, priestly specialists who defleshed the bones and placed them in a chest. A communal feast followed, a ceremony when the bones were deposited in the charnel house. The burial remained in the charnel house for some time, commemorated at regular ceremonies and feasts. Eventually, sometimes when the charnel house was full, the bones were ceremonially removed and interred. The regular feasts associated with mortuary ceremonies and charnel houses may have served a practical role in Choctaw society, to ensure redistribution of game meat and other foods throughout society, to compensate for periods of scarcity, perhaps to stimulate production.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Superficially, Choctaw burial customs seem to parallel those found under Hopewell mounds quite closely (Seeman, 1979b). Both sets of customs involved a sequence of exposure, defleshing, sometimes cremation, redepositing of the dead in charnel houses, and reinterment in burial mounds. If the animal bones found under many Hopewell mounds are the remains of meals, then mortuary customs may also have provided a context for redistribution of food supplies. But there are significant differences as well. Hopewell people relied more heavily on cremation, placed great importance on exotic artefacts and materials in burial furniture, and destroyed their charnel houses when they were full.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"To suggest that Hopewell and Choctaw burial customs were identical, that we can use historic custom in a straightforward manner to interpret mortuary remains from much earlier times, is the height of folly. Rather, as Mark Seeman argues (1979b), Hopewell charnel houses may have served as a catalyst for local chieftains to manage food resources, not only the increasing yield from native plant gardens, but also game meat, food that flowed into the charnel house as offerings and was redistributed at feasts and other ceremonies. Perhaps, too, local Hopewell leaders were reinforced in their political and ritual authority, for, as is well known from societies all over the world, chiefdoms obtain their political power from their spiritual authority, perhaps, in this case, an authority intimately associated with game animals, the wild creatures depicted so frequently  in Hopewell art and commemorated with dance masks and other artifacts.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"It should be stressed, however, that Hopewell is a phenomenon rather than a widespread culture within finite boundaries. There may have been ritual and exchange links between neighboring population concentrations in Ohio, Illinois, and further afield. The underlying culture was always local, displaying a variety of adaptations and local variations, many of them in communities that had never seen a Hopewell earthwork or given support to a 'Big Man.'"
