The Himyarites appear to have been clients of the Aksumites at least until about 298 and therefore enemies of Rome but they appear to have thrown off the Aksumite yoke at least temporarily after that, or at least their independent embassy to Persia, in about AD 300 would seem to suggest this, but ... the alliances were unstable".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_YeHmyr2] "the Himyarites seem to have recognized the Aksumites as their overlords by at least about 296-298, which suggests a defeat, but the situation fluctuated."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_YeHmyr2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ YeHmyr2 ♥</b> and before that Kingdom of Saba and Dhu-Raydan.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> The major change in this period from polytheistic to monotheistic religion occurred gradually.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ EtAksm1 ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Himyarite ♥</b> Himayrite is repeated referred to as a civilization.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_YeHmyr2] "The South Arabia civilizations were literate during most of the first millennium BC and AD".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_YeHmyr2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Zarfar ♥</b> The Himyarite capital was Zarfar.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_YeHmyr2] Also known as Dhu-Raydan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_YeHmyr2] "The last of the great pre-Islamic kingdoms, that of Himyar, was the only one ruled from the central highlands rather than the desert's edge."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_YeHmyr2] When Zarfar became the capital it displaced Marib of the Sabaeans and Qarnaw of the Minaeans.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Language</b><b>♠ Language ♣ Sab ♥</b>  The spoken language may have been slightly different to the written language. The Himyarites used Sabaic in their inscriptions "yet frequently made mistakes and introduced alien words and foreign grammatical features which presumably derived from their own spoken languages."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_YeHmyr2] "Sab. became the official language of the Himyarites, and its use was expanded to most parts of the southern highlands. There is no doubt, however, that Sab. was not the Himyarites' vernacular."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_YeHmyr2] "Sab. is the only ESA language for which a widely acknowledge periodization was established. Its history may be subdivided into archaic (1st millennium B.C.E.), middle (1st c. B.C.E.-late 4th c. C.E.). and late or monotheistic, up to late 6th c. C.E.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_YeHmyr2] Hitti says the Himyarite language "was practically the same as that of the Sabaeans and Minaeans before them."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_YeHmyr2] The Himyarite's "linguistic cousins" were Ethiopian. This is in contrast to the northern Arab nomads.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_YeHmyr2] "South Arabian (or South Arabian Epigraphic) is the term used to designate the South Arabian inscriptions. It was comprised of four dialects: Sabaean was spoken in the Marib region, Minean spoken in the Wadi al-Jawf, Qatabanian in the Wadi Bayhan, and Hadramautic in the Wadi Hadhramawt. While they are usually classified as a Semitic language with close ties to Arabic and the languages of Ethiopia, they also show affinities with Ugaritic and Aramaic, ancient languages spoken in the Levant. The phonological system is nearly identical to Arabic (with the addition of one or more phonemes), and like Hebrew and Arabic, it is formed morphologically on consonantal root patterns. The origins of the Sabaean alphabet are now thought to be in the Fertile Crescent, though why or how it spread to South Arabia remains a mystery. With the arrival of Islam to South Arabia in the seventh century CE, Classical Arabic replaced these written languages, and spoken Arabic generally survived in only a few isolated pockets in what are today known as the regions of Mahrah (in southern Yemen and Oman) and the island of Socotra."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_YeHmyr2]<b>♠ Linguistic Family ♣ Semitic ♥</b><b>♠ Language Genus ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b><b>Religion</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious Tradition ♣ Judaism ♥</b> The religion of the Himyarites was pagan and polytheistic in the period 270-375 CE and Jewish or Judaistic monotheism in the period 375-525 CE when they "fell under the influence of Jewish proselytizers"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_YeHmyr2] and by the late 4th century CE were rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_YeHmyr2] "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_YeHmyr2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Sect ♣ ♥</b>In 115 BCE the Himyarites were a tribe from the southwestern highlands of Yemen.

For a time the Himyarites were a subject tribe of the Romans[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_YeHmyr2] and they possessed colonies which seeded the Abyssinian Kingdom in Ethiopia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_YeHmyr2] The wealth of the Himyar state, similarly acquired as other local kingdoms from the trade of incense and spices, came from trading overseas routes. While during the second millennium CE Saba split from Himyar the Himyarites later benefited immensely at the expense of their rival kingdoms as the overland routes became increasingly less efficient and disrupted by warfare, especially in the third century CE, which involved Himyar, Saba, Hadramawt and Aksum.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Himyarites had a much more centralized polity than Saba throughout the early first millennium[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_YeHmyr2] but could not hold back the Abyssinians who invaded and occupied the tihama (Red Sea littoral) from the 2nd century CE; the Ethiopians conquered the Himyarite capital in 240 CE, but agreeing an alliance with Himyar withdraw from the Arabian peninsular[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_YeHmyr2] in about 270 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_YeHmyr2] The Himyar-Abyssinain alliance or vassalage ended about 298 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_YeHmyr2] Himyar "reached the peak of its power in the third century as a result of a successful series of wars against the local heathen tribes and the African realm of Ethiopia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_YeHmyr2] Between 270-280 CE the Sabaean Kingdom was annexed by the Himyarites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_YeHmyr2] Hadramawt was conquered by 300 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_YeHmyr2] Throughout this period the profits from the incense trade were in a progressive decline as the rise of Christianity in the west had reduced demand for a product that was most commonly used in pagan rituals. When in 395 CE the Roman emperor Theodosius declared Christianity to be the official state religion of the Roman Empire the trade ceased entirely.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At this same time Himyarites also were undergoing their own seismic shift in religious belief system - rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines by the late 4th century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_YeHmyr2] "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_YeHmyr2] "From the 4th century on the Himyarite kings were either full members or sympathizers of Judaism" and the Jewish faith became "the dominant religion" in South Arabia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_YeHmyr2] In the later fourth century there was a Jewish dynasty of kings known as the Tabbai'a.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_YeHmyr2] A list of Himyarite's known Jewish kings include: Yassirum Yohre'am (from 270 CE); 'Amr-Shlomo ben David (325-330 CE); Malki Kariba Juha'min (378-385 CE); Abu Kariba As'as (385-420 or 445 CE); Shurihbi'il Yakkuf (468-480 CE); Martad Ilan ('Judaized' 495-515 CE); Yusuf Ash'ar Dhu Nuwas (515-525 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_YeHmyr2] The Himyarite army adopted Judaism as its official religion at the start of the fifth century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Christianity also was present in Himyar at least from the first half of the 4th century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_YeHmyr2] when the Christian missionary Theophilus arrived and "complained that he found a great number of Jews".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_YeHmyr2] By 350 CE Christian communities were becoming established and over the next 100 years, "missionaries systematically converted many Arabian tribes from their traditional polytheistic practices to monotheistic Christianity".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_YeHmyr2] It is also suggested that the rulers were not Jewish but Monophysite Christians. According to Friedman (2006) Himyarite colonists, the Axumites, in the land of Cush (Ethiopia) "which they renamed Axum ... converted to Monophysite Christianity at the beginning of the fourth century. Between 340 to 378, the Axumites returned to Yemen and imposed their rule and religion over the Himyarites. Although the interregnum was short-lived, the impact of the Axumites was very profound. Yemen was a Christian land, with churches and a cathedral in San'a, and all but one of the restored Himyarite monarchs (378-525) were Monophysite Christians. The lone heretic was Dhu-Nuwas who, for unknown reasons, hated Christians and converted to Judaism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_YeHmyr2] However, Christians appear to have been repressed due to a perceived association with influence of the Byzantine Empire: "in the 470s ... a priest named Azqir was executed for active proselytisation in Najran".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_54_YeHmyr2] Hitti also mentions the 340-378 CE period of Abyssinian rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]An inscription dated to 378 CE claimed "the completion of buildings by a Himyar monarch had been accomplished 'through the power of their lord of sky and heaven,' and phrases such as 'the owner of the sky and earth,' and the expression 'the Merciful' also were used.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_YeHmyr2] It has been suggested that the Himyarite "profession of monotheism, and later full-fledged Judaism, distanced the Himyarites from the Christianity of the Byzantines and their Ethiopian allies and the Zoroastrianism of the Persians"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_YeHmyr2] so that their strategically located state had an independent or neutral identity.

The Byzantine Empire in alliance with the Aksumite Kingdom invaded the Himyarite kingdom and Dhu Nuwas was removed. Himyar and the Red Sea Coast was thereafter ruled directly by the Christian Ethiopians until the Persian conquest in 570 CE, interrupted by the Christian Ethiopian governor-general Abraha's declaration of independence between 550-553 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_YeHmyr2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Himyar ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Himyar_400CE: 378CE-499CE; Himyar_500CE: 500CE-525CE ♥</b>  Himyar_400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_YeHmyr2] Himyar_500CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_62_YeHmyr2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  226274: 378CE-499CE;  650623: 500CE-525CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Semitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Sabaic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Judaism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Christianity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Ancient Arabic Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family2 ♣ Almaqah paganism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=YeHmyr2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [250,000-350,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At their heights, the Sabean and Himyarite kingdoms embraced much of historic Yemen."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_63_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the fourth century Himyar covered the lands of former Saba, Hadramawt, the mountains and the Tihamah (Red Sea coast) and Yamanat (probably the entire southern coast).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_YeHmyr2]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [300,000-500,000] ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]A population estimate for the kingdom of Saba at its height could be used for the Himyarite kingdom which must have covered the same area, if not more.

"'Athtar almost always occupies first place in lists and his cult was spread throughout the region."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_YeHmyr2] Different polities/people had their own god. "The patron deity (shym) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of 'Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), 'Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the 'chrildren of their respective patron deity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_81_YeHmyr2] The pagan religion of South Arabia "was in its essence a planetary astral system in which the cult of the moon-god prevailed. The moon, known in Hadramawt as Sin, to the Minaeans as Wadd (love or lover, father), to the Sabaeans as Almaqah (the health-giving god?) and to the Qatabanians as 'Amm (paternal uncle), stood at the head of the pantheon. He was conceived of as a masculine deity and took precedence over the sun, Shams, who was his consort. 'Athtar (Venus, corresponding to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, Phoenician 'Ashtart), their son, was the third member of the triad. From this celestial pair sprang the many other heavenly bodies considered divine."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pagan Himyarites likely worshipped Almaqah from the time the kingdom was combined with Saba. Hitti writes that the "Himyarites were close kinsmen of the Sabaeans and, as the youngest branch of the sock, became the inheritors of the Minaeo-Sabaean culture and trade."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_YeHmyr2] The Himyarites worshipped Almaqah, 'Athtar and other deities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_YeHmyr2] Philostorgius said of the Himyarites: 'They sacrifice to the sun and moon and spirits of the land.'"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The pagan Himyarites practiced dedications to temples[MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_YeHmyr2] which were likely sufficiently complex to archive papyrus legal statements concerning the usage of tombs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_YeHmyr2] Minaean carvings in the temple ruins of al-Hazm, from the first millennium BCE, suggest dancing girls may have been included among the temple servants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_88_YeHmyr2] Sabaean temples are known to have received tithes at the federal and local levels and its financing may been the "divine assistance" behind construction projects. "Some Middle 'Sabaean' temples may have acted as 'insurance companies' ... Hence the presence of some kind of insurance company which would provide assistance (to build, say, a house after it had been destroyed) was really very practical and useful for most clans. By paying their tithe ('s2r) to the local temples, the tribesmen paid a sort of 'premium' to this insurance company', whereby they could expect to get their 'compensation' when they needed it."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The religion of the Himyarites was pagan and polytheistic in the period 270-375 CE and Jewish or Judaistic monotheism in the period 375-525 CE when they "fell under the influence of Jewish proselytizers"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_YeHmyr2] and by the late 4th century CE were rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_91_YeHmyr2] "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_92_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"From the 4th century on the Himyarite kings were either full members or sympathizers of Judaism" and the Jewish faith became "the dominant religion" in South Arabia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_93_YeHmyr2] "Rome's destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70 brought Jewish emigrants to South Arabia, as well as the Christian message."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_94_YeHmyr2] Jews also may have emigrated to Yemen after the destruction of the First Temple of Jerusalem in 587 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_95_YeHmyr2] In the later fourth century there was a Jewish dynasty of kings known as the Tabbai'a.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_96_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A list of Himyarite's known Jewish kings include: Yassirum Yohre'am (from 270 CE); 'Amr-Shlomo ben David (325-330 CE); Malki Kariba Juha'min (378-385 CE); Abu Kariba As'as (385-420 or 445 CE); Shurihbi'il Yakkuf (468-480 CE); Martad Ilan ('Judaized' 495-515 CE); Yusuf Ash'ar Dhu Nuwas (515-525 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_97_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_YeHmyr2] The Himyarite army adopted Judaism as its official religion at the start of the fifth century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_99_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Christianity also was present in Himyar at least from the first half of the 4th century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_100_YeHmyr2] when the Christian missionary Theophilus arrived and "complained that he found a great number of Jews".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_101_YeHmyr2] The Christian message was probably first carried to Arabia by hermits and traders; and, "since there was a significant Jewish presence in southern Arabia, especially in Najran, Jewish converts to Christianity could have brought the Christian message to Arabia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_102_YeHmyr2] "By the year 350 Christian communities were established. During the fourth and fifth centuries AD, missionaries systematically converted many Arabian tribes from their traditional polytheistic practices to monotheistic Christianity, which spread throughout the area later known as Yemen."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_103_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is also suggested that the rulers were not Jewish but Monophysite Christians. According to Friedman (2006) Himyarite colonists, the Axumites, in the land of Cush (Ethiopia) "which they renamed Axum ... converted to Monophysite Christianity at the beginning of the fourth century. Between 340 to 378, the Axumites returned to Yemen and imposed their rule and religion over the Himyarites. Although the interregnum was short-lived, the impact of the Axumites was very profound. Yemen was a Christian land, with churches and a cathedral in San'a, and all but one of the restored Himyarite monarchs (378-525) were Monophysite Christians. The lone heretic was Dhu-Nuwas who, for unknown reasons, hated Christians and converted to Judaism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_104_YeHmyr2] Hitti also mentions the 340-378 CE period of Abyssinian rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_105_YeHmyr2] Evans (2000) writes: "Christianity and Judaism both struggled for the allegiance of the Himyarite kings, and at Justin's accession [518 CE], Christianity with the support of Axum had the upper hand. The king was a Christian and an Axumite vassal."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_106_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, most scholars call the early monotheistic Himyarites Jewish or Judaistic. Christians were repressed due to a perceived association with influence of the Byzantine Empire: "in the 470s ... a priest named Azqir was executed for active proselytisation in Najran".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_107_YeHmyr2] "Dhu Nuwas (515-25), a Himyarite king, changed the state religion to -&gt; Judaism and began to massacre Christians."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_108_YeHmyr2] McLaughlin (2007) says "the last Himyarite king changed it to Judaism and killed thousands of Christians at Najran."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_109_YeHmyr2] Orlin (2016 writes that the process through which Himyar converted to Judaism is unclear - some have speculated that the influence of agents from the Palestinian Jewish community was at work - but the epigraphic proof of a transformation of the public official religion of the state is undeniable.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_110_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]An inscription dated to 378 CE claimed "the completion of buildings by a Himyar monarch had been accomplished 'through the power of their lord of sky and heaven,' and phrases such as 'the owner of the sky and earth,' and the expression 'the Merciful' also were used.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_111_YeHmyr2] It has been suggested that the Himyarite "profession of monotheism, and later full-fledged Judaism, distanced the Himyarites from the Christianity of the Byzantines and their Ethiopian allies and the Zoroastrianism of the Persians"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_112_YeHmyr2] so that their strategically located state had an independent or neutral identity.

♥</b><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The religion of the Himyarites was pagan and polytheistic in the period 270-375 CE and Jewish or Judaistic monotheism in the period 375-525 CE when they "fell under the influence of Jewish proselytizers"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_YeHmyr2] and by the late 4th century CE were rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_247_YeHmyr2] "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_248_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"From the 4th century on the Himyarite kings were either full members or sympathizers of Judaism" and the Jewish faith became "the dominant religion" in South Arabia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_249_YeHmyr2] "Rome's destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70 brought Jewish emigrants to South Arabia, as well as the Christian message."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_250_YeHmyr2] Jews also may have emigrated to Yemen after the destruction of the First Temple of Jerusalem in 587 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_251_YeHmyr2] In the later fourth century there was a Jewish dynasty of kings known as the Tabbai'a.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_252_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]A list of Himyarite's known Jewish kings include: Yassirum Yohre'am (from 270 CE); 'Amr-Shlomo ben David (325-330 CE); Malki Kariba Juha'min (378-385 CE); Abu Kariba As'as (385-420 or 445 CE); Shurihbi'il Yakkuf (468-480 CE); Martad Ilan ('Judaized' 495-515 CE); Yusuf Ash'ar Dhu Nuwas (515-525 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_253_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_REF_254_YeHmyr2] The Himyarite army adopted Judaism as its official religion at the start of the fifth century CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_255_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Christianity also was present in Himyar at least from the first half of the 4th century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_256_YeHmyr2] when the Christian missionary Theophilus arrived and "complained that he found a great number of Jews".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_257_YeHmyr2] The Christian message was probably first carried to Arabia by hermits and traders; and, "since there was a significant Jewish presence in southern Arabia, especially in Najran, Jewish converts to Christianity could have brought the Christian message to Arabia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_258_YeHmyr2] "By the year 350 Christian communities were established. During the fourth and fifth centuries AD, missionaries systematically converted many Arabian tribes from their traditional polytheistic practices to monotheistic Christianity, which spread throughout the area later known as Yemen."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_259_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is also suggested that the rulers were not Jewish but Monophysite Christians. According to Friedman (2006) Himyarite colonists, the Axumites, in the land of Cush (Ethiopia) "which they renamed Axum ... converted to Monophysite Christianity at the beginning of the fourth century. Between 340 to 378, the Axumites returned to Yemen and imposed their rule and religion over the Himyarites. Although the interregnum was short-lived, the impact of the Axumites was very profound. Yemen was a Christian land, with churches and a cathedral in San'a, and all but one of the restored Himyarite monarchs (378-525) were Monophysite Christians. The lone heretic was Dhu-Nuwas who, for unknown reasons, hated Christians and converted to Judaism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_260_YeHmyr2] Hitti also mentions the 340-378 CE period of Abyssinian rule.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_261_YeHmyr2] Evans (2000) writes: "Christianity and Judaism both struggled for the allegiance of the Himyarite kings, and at Justin's accession [518 CE], Christianity with the support of Axum had the upper hand. The king was a Christian and an Axumite vassal."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_262_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, most scholars call the early monotheistic Himyarites Jewish or Judaistic. Christians were repressed due to a perceived association with influence of the Byzantine Empire: "in the 470s ... a priest named Azqir was executed for active proselytisation in Najran".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_263_YeHmyr2] "Dhu Nuwas (515-25), a Himyarite king, changed the state religion to -&gt; Judaism and began to massacre Christians."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_YeHmyr2] McLaughlin (2007) says "the last Himyarite king changed it to Judaism and killed thousands of Christians at Najran."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_265_YeHmyr2] Orlin (2016 writes that the process through which Himyar converted to Judaism is unclear - some have speculated that the influence of agents from the Palestinian Jewish community was at work - but the epigraphic proof of a transformation of the public official religion of the state is undeniable.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_266_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]An inscription dated to 378 CE claimed "the completion of buildings by a Himyar monarch had been accomplished 'through the power of their lord of sky and heaven,' and phrases such as 'the owner of the sky and earth,' and the expression 'the Merciful' also were used.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_267_YeHmyr2] It has been suggested that the Himyarite "profession of monotheism, and later full-fledged Judaism, distanced the Himyarites from the Christianity of the Byzantines and their Ethiopian allies and the Zoroastrianism of the Persians"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_268_YeHmyr2] so that their strategically located state had an independent or neutral identity. Written sources mention the presence of synagogues in Zafar and Najran.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_269_YeHmyr2][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br><i>Judaistic religion</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In all these three cases [quoted from I Maccabees] the Temple [in Jerusalem] is the main Jewish identity marker, together with the Law/Torah. Although the centrality of Temple and Torah in ancient Judaism is obvious, the fact that the Temple shares equal prominence with the Torah attests to its prominence. The juxtaposition of the Temple to the Torah in its entirety, as if these were two separate entities of equal value, demonstrates the centrality of the Temple. It also shows that the author found it necessary to present Simon as a religious leader, the savior and protector of the Jewish religion and its institutions."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_270_YeHmyr2]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=YeHmyr2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div>Code the variables below for the collective ritual of the official cult that is performed on the largest scale.

The manner in which Jews observed this requirement was highly inconsistent. Some went up to the Temple [in Jerusalem] several times in a year, or at least once a year… some several times in a lifetime, some once in a lifetime, and many probably did not practice pilgrimage at all. The pilgrimage to Jerusalem was made on the feasts of Passover, Pentecost [<i>Shavuot</i>] and Tabernacles [<i>Sukkot</i>]. At each feast, tens of thousands of Jews from Judaea, Galilee, and the Diaspora went up to the Temple and offered sacrifices. The pilgrims needed to provide themselves with a substantial amount of money to defray the expenses of the journey and the prescribed sacrifices."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_271_YeHmyr2] However, by the fourth and fifth centuries, it would no longer have been possible for Jews to make pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem, as it had been destroyed. All the same, pilgrimage had been an important form of worship in pre-Judaic Arabia: "To a number of these holy places pilgrimages would be made at certain fixed times of the year. The Sabaeans were, for example, cemented by an annual procession to the temple of Almaqah in Marib at the time of the summer rains. Not only did the people of Saba attend, but also all their allies were at least expected to send delegations, as the tribe of Sam‘ay were reminded in an edict of their patron god Ta’lab (RES 4176). The Tal’ab was also an object of pilgrimage at his mountain abode in the land of Hamdan (Gl 1361; Hamdani 8.82- 83). And people went in honour of Dhu Samawi at Yathill (CIS 4.547) and of Sayin at Shabwa (Ir app. B3). For as long as these ceremonies lasted pilgrims were obliged to set aside their weapons (CIS 4.548) and to abstain from sexual relations (CIS 4.533), and they would don special garments or adornments to advertise that they were temporarily exempt from the usual rules of tribal behaviour."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_272_YeHmyr2] "Throughout pre-Islamic Arabia, “truces of God” allowed people to attend in security the yearly pilgrimages to important shrines. The rites included purification and the wearing of ritual clothing, sexual abstinence, abstention from shedding blood, and circuits performed (ṭawaf, dawar) around the sacred object; they were concluded by the slaughter of animals, which were eaten in collective feasts. Today such practices still form the core of the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. The classical, Nabataean, Liḥyanite, and Sabaean sources mention pilgrimages."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_273_YeHmyr2] Overall, it seems reasonable to infer some hybrid mixture of Judaic and Ancient Arabian pilgrimage rituals here.

(A third prayer, to be recited in the evening yet not corresponding to any sacrifice, was recommended but not required.) The regularity of the sacrificial system was transferred to prayer. The rabbis also determined the content of the central prayers, fixing their themes and structure.

"From all regions of Arabia we have evidence, sometimes archaeological and sometimes literary, for communal meals ... These might be joyous affairs, such as circumcision and marriage feasts, when whole communities came together to witness the rites and share in the repast. Others were more sombre, such as funerary banquets ... But all such occasions of communal consumption served many functions beyond the immediate one of satiation. They often had social aims, for eating and drinking together promotes companionship, so confirming and reinforcing group identity and solidarity. If that group was a cultic entity, then communal meals took on the significance of a declaration of confessional allegiance, and to eat the consecrated food of non-believers might be regarded as an abomination. As the eucharistic meal of Christians, the divinities themselves might be present, and by admitting man to their table they bound him to them in a special relationship. There could also be a political dimension, for it was by sponsoring public feasts that an aspiring leader became a man of influence and renown, his cavalier generosity to others creating obligations of reciprocity as well as earning him repute. A particularly long-lived form of feasting is the ritual banquet (mrzh'), a celebration attended by a select group of colleagues in honour of a particular deity or deities. It is attested as early as the thirteenth century BC in a text from Ugarit, which describes the preparations taken by the chief of the gods for his guests, the slaughtering of animals and the provision of wine."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_357_YeHmyr2] "Feasts might also be profane affairs, just plain revelry and camraderie. Allusions to gatherings for the purpose of enjoying wine, women and song are common in the poems of the pastoralists of north Arabia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_358_YeHmyr2] "Also in the category of profane feasts are the meals provided for the poor and needy, for the stranger and wayfarer.

Polygyny, as the marriage of the same man to two or more wives with the same legal status, is distinct in scripture from concubinage, in which a man took secondary wives (usually foreigners or women of lower social standing). It is distinct, too, from a sexual relationship between a free man and a slave woman of his household, which seems to have been unrestricted. Lamech is the first polygamist named in the scriptures (Gen 4:19-24). Others include Esau (Gen 26:34; 28:9; 36:1-5), Elkanah (1 Sam 1:2), and Jacob (Gen 29:15-30).//Although the scriptures presuppose that polygyny is valid, they invite the reader to regard it with suspicion. Some unspecified doom is attached to the brief narrative about Lamech, a descendant of Cain, although nothing in the text attributes his misfortune to his having had two wives. Deuteronomy 17:17 counsels that a king should not have many wives lest his heart be distracted. Solomon’s downfall is attributed to his having many wives and concubines, although his attachment to foreign women may have been the chief source of his troubles (1 Kgs 11:1-6). The polygamous marriages of Esau, Elkanah, and Jacob were marred by favoritism and by discord among wives. The story of Abraham, his wife Sarah, and her foreign handmaid Hagar (Gen 16) drives that message home, although Hagar was presumably only a sexual partner, and not Abraham’s wife in the proper sense (notwithstanding Gen 16:3). But these negative associations fall short of opprobrium. Every family has it dysfunctional aspects, and the Jewish scriptures do not idealize the human condition."

These were combined with the almost ubiquitous exhortation to remember what it was like to be a slave, repeated more than any other phrase in the Bible, and the command to look after the widow and the orphan, the second most repeated phrase.

Marriage within the clan was preferable, and marriage outside the people was highly suspect, in part because it risked contamination from alien laws and cults. The reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah after the return from exile extended a prohibition against miscegenation with other peoples, which had formerly applied only to priests and Levites, to all Israelites (Ezra 9:1-2; 10:1-5; Neh 10:28-30; 13:23-27), although the story of Ruth is a touching exception to such stringency (Eskenazi, 2011)."

It is the use of the same term (tame') for both that leads to the mistaken impression that they are variants of the same phenomenon. In fact, he maintains, the distinction is fully recognized. Some impurities require simple purification rituals (washing, sacrifice), while others have the most dire consequences not only for individuals but for the entire nation. Leviticus 15:19-24, on the impurity of menstruation, illustrates ritual impurity: menstruation is an entirely natural process, no kind of moral stigma attaches to it, but it causes a mild impurity that requires abstention from sexual relations, bathing, and putting on clean clothes. Leviticus 18:24-30, on the other hand, speaks of the 'defilement' caused by engaging in the 'abominable' practices of pagan nations, which is so powerful that it will cause the land to 'vomit the inhabitants out', and the offenders to be 'cut off'.
