Later Jin (also known as the Jin Dynasty, Great Jin or Jurchen Dynasty) ruled north China from 1115 to 1234 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_CnLrJin] The dynasty was founded by a confederation of Jurchen tribes from around Manchuria that defeated the Liao in 1115 CE and then ousted the Northern Song.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_CnLrJin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Jin forces captured the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng and forced the Song south in 1127 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CnLrJin] The Jin territory included part of Korea in northeast Asia, and Uighur and Tibetan land in western China. In 1153 CE, the Jurchen government moved its capital from Manchuria to modern-day Beijing.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]This period was marked by conflict with the Southern Song and the Mongols. The Jurchen government also struggled with economic inflation and flooding.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_CnLrJin] In 1233 CE, the dynasty was conquered by Mongol forces, who then ruled as the Yuan dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_CnLrJin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The traditional Jurchen system of hereditary military chieftains was maintained by the first Jin ruler, Emperor Taizu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CnLrJin] After conquering the Liao and Northern Song, later rulers adopted a Chinese-style imperial central government, which was accepted as legitimate by Chinese Confucian scholars.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnLrJin] The Jin imperial government copied a number of Song institutions, including the nine-rank system for officials and recruitment by civil service examinations.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CnLrJin][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Jin Dynasty was the first period in Chinese history in which large populations of ethnic Han citizens were ruled by an outsider government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CnLrJin] While many Jurchen people moved from Manchuria into China during Jin rule,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnLrJin] they still only made up about 10 percent of the population of Jin Dynasty China.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnLrJin] The population of the Jin dynasty was between 45 million and 54 million people in 1200 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnLrJin][MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnLrJin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Jurchen Dynasty ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Jurchen_1100CE: 1115CE-1199CE; Jurchen_1200CE: 1200CE-1243CE ♥</b>  Jurchen_1100CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnLrJin] Jurchen_1200CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnLrJin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  328324: 1115CE-1199CE;  2258107: 1200CE-1243CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Sino-Tibetan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Sinitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Middle Chinese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Imperial Confucianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Daoism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Po-Ju Tuan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=CnLrJin&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 3,600,000 ♥</b> in squared kilometers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [45,000,000-54,000,000]: 1200 CE ♥</b> People. 32,700,000: 1142 CE; {44,705,086; 39,663,400; 36,989,014}: 1187 CE; 45,447,900: 1190 CE; 48,490,400: 1195 CE; {45,816,079; 53,532,151}: 1207 CE; 53,720,000: 1210 CE.

Those in charge of states, fiefs, and families were privileged and obliged to officiate at rites; those not so privileged were expected to assist in whatever capacity was appropriate to them. The chief sacrificer had to purify himself in advance through abstinence of varying duration. At the appointed time, he would enter the consecrated ancestral shrine, bow, prostrate himself, and make offerings of food and wine. He was assisted by a variety of attendants, including those who prepared the food, took charge of the utensils, performed divinations, and pronounced prayers. During major sacrifices, one boy or man, preferably a son of the chief sacrificer, would act as a vessel for the spirit of the ancestors. This impersonator also needed to undergo purification before the rite. During the rite he would drink the wine offered to the ancestors and in trancelike fashion passively allow the spirits to animate him. A ritual expert would interpret the ancestors' wishes, which in the standard liturgy of the <i>I-Ii</i> was to convey blessings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_147_CnLrJin] NOTE: It seems more sensible, here, to exclude "major sacrifices" and only consider the simpler types of ancestor worship: it seems reasonable to infer that the latter occurred more frequently than the former. However, it would be quite easy to change a few key variables from "absent" to "present" should it be decided to incorporate the major sacrifices in this ritual--Cho-Yun and Linduff (1988), in particular, offer a detailed description of these rites. Commoner families started to have their own shrines for ancestor worship starting in the 12th century.

The following is an account of how the New Year was celebrated during the Song Dynasty, both predecessors and contemporaries of the Jin. Given the latter's comprehensive sinicization, it seems reasonable to infer that they would have celebrated the New Year in a similar way. Rituals connected to the New Year lasted for about two weeks, and mostly involved visits and feasts and among relatives, as well as exorcistic rites. At the end of this two-week period, the Lantern Festival was celebrated, mostly in the cities. "The festival in the Song included three distinct events: (1) the hanging of large and elaborate lanterns of various descriptions at the <i>yamens</i> and major Buddhist monasteries within the city; (2) a vibrant fair that drew large numbers of local prostitutes; and (3) a party thrown by the prefect for the subordinate officials under his command, with candles, dancing girls, performances of various kinds, and parades to the large monasteries where the lanterns were displayed. 'The officials and common people watch and enjoy the spectacle. The powerful families and prominent lineages set up positions from which to watch outside the east and west <i>yamen</i> walkways. Along the thoroughfares and larger streets, there are spectators at every house.' The festival was celebrated primarily in the city, but 'from the distant rural areas and subordinate counties, visitors come throughout the night without a break.' A well-known story of Song Fuzhou, found in the gazetteer and also in many other sources, suggests that the popular celebration of the Lantern Festival was sponsored and even prescribed by local officials. In the late eleventh century, the story goes, the prefect ordered every household to purchase and hang ten lanterns to contribute to the overall spectacle."

"The anxiety from preparing for the Keju exams and the disappointment of doing poorly on them led to incidents of pathological behavior. Repeatedly failing the Keju exams took a severe psychological toll on the failed candidates. Effects of failure ranged from mild cases of self-doubt to various psychopathologies and, in some cases, to suicide or physical violence directed at others. In her analysis of classic exam-related novels, Judith Zeitlin found that physicians during the Ming dynasty had identified a specific form of anxiety-depression, called by these physicians <i>siyu</i> and referred to as 'male anxiety' by Benjamin Elman, that is associated with repeatedly failing the Keju exams. [...] What is more, these psychological and behavioral phenomena are not unique to a certain period of time. Rather, cases like those mentioned were documented throughout the history of the exam and were particularly prevalent after the Song dynasty when the exam became available to the general public and even more highly competitive." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_CnLrJin] "Severe punishments were meted out for people caught cheating, including being caned or being placed in stocks for a month. There were occasional cases of actual executions of cheaters. By the time of the Song dynasty, large prisonlike exam compounds that could accommodate up to 22,000 or more examinees, complete with armed guards and with thorny bushes planted around the outer walls, were built. During the exams, very strict personal search (including body searches) procedures and very strict exam procedures were followed. Candidates were grouped into small groups responsible for each other’s behavior. Watchtowers were built over and dispersed around the exam compounds. Other measures included strict and precise rules and specifications regarding clothing and very detailed specifications of what items could be brought to the exam compounds. Also included were the sequestering of examiners prior to exams, restricting examinee movements during exams, physically separating exam scorers from exam compound administrators and other staff to prevent the influencing of the scorers’ judgment, forbidding the use of any words or phrases in the essays and poems that would reveal an examinee’s identity, and the separation of the responsibilities for exam administration (Department of Rites) and for subsequent official appointments of successful examinees (Department of Personnel) to minimize corruption. These measures were in addition to the widely known practice of covering the examinees’ name to keep scoring anonymous and employing copyists to copy the examinees’ answers and scoring only the copy to avoid the recognition of handwriting.

So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_369_CnLrJin] </i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_370_CnLrJin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

[...] It must be admitted that the Chinese hardly contributed anything to the structure or the punishments of purgatory, but simply took over literally the ideas that had arrived from India."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_377_CnLrJin] <i>In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_378_CnLrJin]</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Human Enforcement of Morality</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (śīla): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_379_CnLrJin] According to Confucianism, one should care for one’s immediate family [MAJIDBENAM_REF_380_CnLrJin].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ present ♥</b> Confucianism: “Other virtues that Confucius emphasized are honesty and sincerity. Honesty is more than telling the truth, though that, of course, is required. Honesty is living up to what one says one will do. It means keeping your promises. [...] Sincerity, or integrity, is closely allied to honesty. It means there should be no distance between what we think, what we say, and what we do. In many situations we can find ourselves busy analyzing a situation and what we are looking for is how this situation will harm or benefit ourselves. While we are thinking of how to benefit ourselves, we may say things or do things that do not reflect what we are really thinking. A sincere person does not have this split. Rather, they think, say, and do, the same thing, not calculating their own advantage.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_381_CnLrJin] Buddhism: “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). In standardised canonical descriptions (DN 22, MN 141, etc.) these are frequently explained indirectly - by stating which behaviour should be avoided. ‘Right speech’ means to abstain from lying, from malicious, divisive, or harsh speech and from frivolous or idle talk. [...] ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_382_CnLrJin] Daoism: “The Xiang’er jie or Xiang’er precepts are a set of thirty-six rules (*’’jie’’), nine expressed as positive imperatives and twenty-seven that are expressed as negative injunctions. [...] [The] first of the nine (in Boenkamp’s interpretation of the ‘’wei’’ of *’’wuwei’’ being taken as ‘artificial, contrived, fabricated, false,” 1997, 51) insists on lacking falseness, while the sixth of the twenty-seven prohibits practicing false arts.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_383_CnLrJin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ uncertain_absent_present ♥</b> Confucianism: the importance of adherence to a particular school of thought, such as Confucian versus Legalist, became important part of training of officials, especially after reforms of Wudi and Tung Chung-shu’s principles derived from the ‘5 Classics’.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_384_CnLrJin] Traditions also stressed loyalty to lineage group, but many traditions (esp. Legalist) warned against lineage connections becoming more powerful than connections to the state, leaving elite family heads in a position to threaten the ruler's authority[MAJIDBENAM_REF_385_CnLrJin] However, Buddhism taught to cultivate equanity toward all, including enemies [MAJIDBENAM_REF_386_CnLrJin].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> Confucianism: “Dutifulness, like filial piety, was meant to teach people to put the interests of their superior, whether father or ruler, before their own. Private ambitions must be subordinated to the loyalty one feels. Like filial piety, loyalty could include criticism. Confucius argued that it is one’s duty to object if a ruler is wrong. He said that if one is really loyal, really doing one’s duty, ‘how could you not instruct your ruler?’ As we have seen with filial piety above, criticism is permitted, if done reverently, though the results may be hard on the son or government minister. In a later text, the Book of Ritual, it is noted that a filial son may speak up to criticize his parents three times, but, if ignored, he is to follow their wishes. Similarly, it says, a government minister should speak to his ruler and offer advice and criticism. If after three attempts the ruler continues to ignore the min- ister, the minister should resign. The son cannot escape his relation to his parents, but a government minister is not related by blood to the ruler and so is permitted to leave the relationship if his advice is not taken.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_387_CnLrJin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “Even a first and superficial glance makes it clear that purifying, purification and actions or things that are considered pure play a decisive role in virtually all Chinese religions.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_388_CnLrJin] Some brief notes on purity in Chinese Daoism. In Bley, M., N. Jaspert and S. Kock (eds) ‘’Discourses of purity in transcultural perspective (300-1600)’’ pp. 42-53. Boston: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> “The privileged place of the family in the process of moral development is highlighted by the virtue of ‘’xiao’’, “filial piety”. The term goes back to the Bronze Age (and is not exclusive to Confucianism - indeed, virtually every Chinese ethical tradition had a concept of filial piety), but before Confucius it had referred to reverence for all ancestors, and mostly had to do with due sacrifice on their behalf. As with so many other moral and religious terms, Confucius and his followers radically reinterpreted it 5 to mean appropriate behaviour visà-vis one’s parents, and not only after their death. Merely providing sustenance was immediately disparaged as grotesquely inadequate: ‘Ziyou [i.e. the disciple Yan Yan, b. 506 bce] asked about filial piety. The Master said: “What is ‘filial’ nowadays refers to the ability to feed [one’s parents]. Even dogs and horses can be fed. If one is not reverent, wherein lies the difference?’ ( Analects 2.7) If one thinks filial piety consists primarily of feeding one’s parents, and not in cultivating one’s reverence, one is treating them like dogs and horses.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_389_CnLrJin] “Filial piety achieves intellectual prominence as a Confucian concept, but it also informs Daoism and Chinese Buddhism.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_390_CnLrJin]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> In Buddhism, physical conflict was seen as undesirable, but, at the same time, an often necessary evil. “As we saw in the chapter on Buddhist Ethics (see Chapter 7) right conduct in thought, word and deed is characterised as peaceful and non-harming behaviour. That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_391_CnLrJin] In Daoism: “From the very beginning of the written tradition of Taoism, there existed a close relation between it and Chinese military and practice. The ‘’Daode jing’’ contains passages that propounded ideas about the nature of warfare (that weapons are inauspicious implements; desolation follows an army) and the proper way for the ruler to engage in combat (conquer strength by manifesting weakness; do not value victory; do not attempt to dominate the world by force of arms) that were immensely influential in later times. [...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_392_CnLrJin] Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures.
