While Vishnuvardhana's (r. 1108-1152) incessant attempts to overthrow the yoke of Chalukya suzerainty proved a failure, he raised his territory to the dignity of a kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InHoysa]. Ballala's time (r.1173-1120) saw the achievement of independence from Chalukyas[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_InHoysa] as their rule fell in 1191 [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_InHoysa]. In 1310, the Hoysala ruler submitted to the Delhi Sultan's army, and the following decades were a struggle of resistance against the Delhi Sultans and the allegiance they had forced on Hoysala [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_InHoysa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Chalukyas of Kalyani ♥</b> Western Chalukya Empire[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> feudal subordinate The Hoysalas began their rule as the feudatories of the Chalukyas and when their power was on the wane, the Hoysalas asserted their independence and established their supremacy over Karnataka as it stands today[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Vijayanagara Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Sosavur; Dvarasamudram; Kannanur ♥</b> Originally, the Hoysalas had their capital at Sosavur or the Sanskrit Shashakapura, and later it was transferred to Halebid or Dorasamudra [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_InHoysa]. Dvarasamudram (or Dorasamudra) was the capital until the late fourteenth century, established in the hill-bounded area of modern Halebid in Hassan district by an eleventh-century Hoysala chief. Dvarasamudram was over 35 miles from the major area of agricultural production and settlement of the kingdom, on the Hemavati River, and 42 miles north of the Kaveri, which formed the boundary with Gangavadi and its ancient Ganga kings to the south [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_InHoysa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ramanatha was expulsed from Kannanur - the loss of that capital city naturally increased Ramanatha’s interes in the plateau. From 1281 his administration on the plateau expanded, and almost certainly in the tear 1283-84, the seat of government was removed to a place called Kunadni. This was the new capital from which Ramanatha chose to survey the collapse of his riparian kingdom [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_InHoysa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The later Hoysala capital Kannanur was established where the Kaveri delta began, between the centres of Chola and Pandya power in the south. Established in the uplands over the gateway to the Kaveri delta, the capital resembled the capitals of other masters of river valleys more than it did Dvarasamudram and thus reflected the now divided character of the Hoysala kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_InHoysa].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Kannada; Sanskrit ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Dravidian; Indo-European ♥</b> Kannada is a Dravidian language[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_InHoysa], and Sanskrit is an Indo-European language[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_InHoysa].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Hoysala dynasty ruled over a territory roughly equivalent to the southern Indian state of Karnataka, plus the eastern and southeastern margins of Andhra Pradesh and the northwest corner of Tamil Nadu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_InHoysa] For much of the 12th century CE, the Hoysalas were mere provincial rulers within the wider Chalukya empire,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_InHoysa] but they rebelled and wrested control over the region from the Chalukyas in 1191.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_InHoysa] They lost their empire with the death of Emperor Vira Virupaksha in 1346.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_InHoysa] Under Hoysala rule, literature and the arts flourished, particularly architecture, as testified by the Hoysala temples at Halebidu, Belur and Somanathapura.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_InHoysa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As with most preceding South Indian polities, the Hoysala ruler held judiciary, executive and legislative powers[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_InHoysa] and was also the polity's supreme military leader.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_InHoysa] He was assisted at court by several ministers[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_InHoysa] and in the provinces by governors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_InHoysa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates for this period could be found in the literature.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Katheriin Liibert ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=InHoysa&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [100,000-200,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1184: Ruling over the area bounded by Konkana, Alvakheda, Bayalnad, Talakad and Savimale , area between Kaveri and Kabbani rivers  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_InHoysa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]up to and about the year 1098: 95 miles long at the longest and 70 miles broad at its widest part, represents the entire known area within which the Hoysala enjoyed the revenues[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_InHoysa] -- this reference refers to period before 1108-1346 CE kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_BR]By the end of Vishnuvardhana’s rule: he had broken the bones of Malava, Cera, Kerala, Nolamba, Kadamba, Kalinga, Anga, Bangala, Varala, Cola, Khasa, Barbara, Oddaha and others  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_InHoysa][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1192: Sevuna, it is true, had many Kannada-speaking subjects, but south of the Krishna most of the subjects looked either to the Hoysala or to the rulers in the Konkana as their natural lead.

[...] [the] First reason is that Brāhman scholars, and priests within Brāhmanical temples, generally did not understand or value festival religion. Festival religion had its roots within the non‐Brāhmanical communities that were traditionally not allowed to worship within the Brāhmanical temples; in many ways it represents an alternative religious form to that offered within the Brāhmanical temples. [...] Second, the festivals have been neglected by scholars because in the nineteenth century when western scholars began the study of Hindu religion, they looked primarily at texts." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_155_InHoysa] Therefore, a generic "large-scale festival" has been reconstructed on the basis of data collected by Younger.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_156_InHoysa] Much of this data relates to the present, as well as to regions (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka) located farther South than the chosen NGA. However, Younger appears to imply that his observation would apply to South India more generally, and, regarding the antiquity of certain festivals, he writes: "Each chapter in this study is a description of a particular festival that is still celebrated. Nevertheless, in some festivals participants insisted that the festival had been celebrated in exactly the same way since preagricultural times and that the hunting symbols providing the basic structure of the celebration were taken from the everyday occupation of the early celebrants. While I was skeptical at first, and made determined efforts to find external evidence to date the celebrations, in the end I found the internal evidence convincing, and suspect that the festivals structured around preagricultural ritual symbols might well be quite old." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_157_InHoysa] The following are a number of generic observations that may well apply to large-scale festivals as they were celebrated throughout Indian history: "The deities have been invited to share in the celebration of the community, but there is no certainty that they will come. Stone temples in South India were built like fortresses with a number of concentric walls around the 'seat' of the deity, or 'seats' of the deities. Priests fed, bathed, and worshiped the deities within these temples daily, and landlords or kings who made major donations for building the temples could arrange for worship within one of the corridors. However, for the mass of the people, entry to the temple was restricted and the primary worship of the deity took place on festival occasions. For the deity to come out of the temple into the community was a major event and involved transferring the power of the deity into either an utsava ayūdha (festival instrument) or an utsava mūrti (festival image). Sometimes this transfer itself is a frightening experience, but the utsava form of the deity is thought to have a totally different personality and can be known only in the context of its encounter with the festival crowds. Priests fed, bathed, and worshiped the deities within these temples daily, and landlords or kings who made major donations for building the temples could arrange for worship within one of the corridors. However, for the mass of the people, entry to the temple was restricted and the primary worship of the deity took place on festival occasions." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_158_InHoysa] "In North India the primary form of popular religion is 'pilgrimage', but individual ritual features such as ecstatic behavior, healing, and large excited crowds are common in both North Indian 'pilgrimages' and South Indian 'festivals.' What distinguishes the South Indian form of popular religion from similar North Indian forms is the more elaborate social arrangements that are part of the South Indian festival.' The 'Dravidian' marriage arrangements characteristic of South India permit marriages with first cousins on the mother's side. This arrangement helped keep land within the larger family network and led to the creation of tight endogamous caste groups. To operate in the economic, political, and cultural arenas, these relatively small caste groups needed forms of common social interaction with others, and festivals provided one of the most effective forums for social interaction. Of course, other structures of social interaction define everyday economic and political relations among the castes, and psychological and religious dimensions of festival activity transcend the social, but South Indian 'festivals' have a specific social function in both reflecting and redefining social structures. This distinguishes them from the more diverse 'pilgrimage' traditions so prominent in North India."

While objects were offered into the fire in the Vedic rites, objects were offered to deities on altars in temple Puja. In the Puja system the items were meant for the enjoyment of the deity rather than as offerings tendered for a tangible (or intangible) benefit of the patron or community. As Davis recounts, 'in Puja, a worshipper invokes or invites the deity into some material form, most often an image or icon visually and symbolically representing the deity, and presents to him both material offerings such as food and clothing and devoted services such as the recitation of his praises, music, dance, and songs. Agama texts classify all these material and performatory presentations to the deity as "services" (Upacara). Vishnu and Siva, as gods simultaneously transcendent and immanent, enter into a variety of both anthropomorphic and aniconic objects so that their devotees may see them and make their offerings of homage.' "In Puja the divine service always takes place in reference to an altar upon which are placed statues or images (Murti) requiring regular worship. Puja in temples and shrines gradually developed into a complicated daily service that was enhanced during special monthly and seasonal observances. Puja is generally centered on pleasing the Lord in the temple with offerings of food, water, incense, flowers, fan, sweets, camphor, lamp wick, unguents, and conch. Music and devotional songs were key items in this arsenal of offerings. While many Pujas continued to include unaccompanied Stuti or Stotra (hymns of praise) to the deities in Sanskrit, they also contained more and more vernacular hymns and songs accompanied by musical instruments."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_199_InHoysa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "Many devout Hindus in the modern world still perform Puja once or twice a day.

While objects were offered into the fire in the Vedic rites, objects were offered to deities on altars in temple Puja. In the Puja system the items were meant for the enjoyment of the deity rather than as offerings tendered for a tangible (or intangible) benefit of the patron or community. As Davis recounts, 'in Puja, a worshipper invokes or invites the deity into some material form, most often an image or icon visually and symbolically representing the deity, and presents to him both material offerings such as food and clothing and devoted services such as the recitation of his praises, music, dance, and songs. Agama texts classify all these material and performatory presentations to the deity as "services" (Upacara). Vishnu and Siva, as gods simultaneously transcendent and immanent, enter into a variety of both anthropomorphic and aniconic objects so that their devotees may see them and make their offerings of homage.' "In Puja the divine service always takes place in reference to an altar upon which are placed statues or images (Murti) requiring regular worship. Puja in temples and shrines gradually developed into a complicated daily service that was enhanced during special monthly and seasonal observances. Puja is generally centered on pleasing the Lord in the temple with offerings of food, water, incense, flowers, fan, sweets, camphor, lamp wick, unguents, and conch. Music and devotional songs were key items in this arsenal of offerings. While many Pujas continued to include unaccompanied Stuti or Stotra (hymns of praise) to the deities in Sanskrit, they also contained more and more vernacular hymns and songs accompanied by musical instruments."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_240_InHoysa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "Many devout Hindus in the modern world still perform Puja once or twice a day.

"With respect to the fundamental characteristics of the Vasantotsava as found in the above Sanskrit texts, we can fruitfully focus our attention in four general directions. Firstly, the Spring Festival crosses sectarian boundaries. It is a popular festival celebrated by several sects as well as outside any readily identifiable sectarian context. No main deity or group of deities is here the consistent object of devotion; the Vasantotsava may be celebrated by all, regardless of private or public devotional affiliations. Second, the element of fire appears in some context in almost all descriptions of this festival: it is a symbol of death, renewal, transformation and purification. Third, the significance of the marriage motif with respect to the Vasantotsava is indicated by a number of texts including the Bhavisya Purana (as previously noted). [...] Fourth and finally the rituals of the Vasantotsava revolve, to a greater or lesser extent, around sensuality. The festival is a fertility festival and erotic motifs from both the mortal and the immortal realms are freely combined with fertility motifs. These four components of the Spring Festival will be treated in turn in the sections that follow. "[...] "The eroticism of the spring celebrations as found in the Ratnavali is characterized by a certain amount of social freedom and licentiousness. Thus the Spring Festival is a peculiar mix of control and freedom: the festival occurs within the city under the auspices of kings and Brahmins and at the same time social barriers are purposefully broken down and the erotic permeates the ritual. The breakdown of social relationships is indicated by rituals such as playing 'Holi' (throwing colored powder), mixing of castes and men and women in the streets, sex, licence, and powder. Eroticism and sexual licence as brought out in the throwing of powder and dancing which comprise this festival reflect the sexual potency of the season."

However, the vast majority of the scholarly literature, at least in English, focuses uniquely on dysphoric rituals that are performed by individuals, often in isolation--e.g. particularly extreme forms of Jain fasting rituals, or Aghori corpse meditation. Collective dysphoric rituals exist in contemporary South India, and some of them appear to have particularly ancient origins. Of course, it is problematic to assume that contemporary South Indian rituals have been the same for hundreds, or even thousands, of years. However, at this early stage of the Seshat enterprise, it is acceptable to use "low-hanging fruit", as we wait for experts to look through the data and confirm or deny the validity of our choices. Moreover, this is what anthropologist Paul Younger [MAJIDBENAM_REF_322_InHoysa] writes on the subject of the antiquity of certain rituals: "in some festivals participants insisted that the festival had been celebrated in exactly the same way since preagricultural times and that the hunting symbols providing the basic structure of the celebration were taken from the everyday occupation of the early celebrants. While I was sceptical at first, and made determined efforts to find external evidence to date the celebrations, in the end I found the internal evidence convincing, and suspect that the festivals structured around preagricultural ritual symbols might well be quite old."[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The ritual coded here is loosely based on a contemporary festival celebrating the Goddess Mariyamman, in Tamilnadu (though similar festivals are widespread in South India [MAJIDBENAM_REF_323_InHoysa]). This ritual appears to have medieval origins [MAJIDBENAM_REF_324_InHoysa]. Though it is unlikely that this ritual was performed exactly the same way in medieval India, it seems reasonable to infer that similar rituals were performed, involving an initial stage in which participants kept difficult vows in the hope that a deity would grant them, their family or their community respite from a period of hardship, and a second stage when those who have successfully kept their vows form a public procession to the deity's temple, bringing their dysphoria to a climax with "strenuous forms of worship and ecstacy" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_325_InHoysa]. "The basic pattern of worship is that a worshiper will take a vow (viratam, Sanskrit: vrata) some months before the festival to worship in a particular way at festival time. Worshipers make these vows in the face of a crisis in their personal lives. Often the crisis involves the health of children or the longing for children, but sometimes it involves other problems with disease, the loss of income, fear of sorcery, and a more general anxiety about 'enemies' in the extended family, in the neighbourhood, or in the workplace. Once the vow has been made, it is thought to take on a power of its own, and nonfulfillment would involve severe penalty. Most vows involve months of fasting and sexual abstinence, shaving the head and putting on bright yellow clothes, taking an exhausting walk from home to the temple area, and finally dramatically 'dancing' along the crowded roadway to the temple. The dance takes many forms. Couples carry newborn babes in a yellow cloth hammock suspended on sugar cane stalks. Some women, elderly people, and small children carry only a small pot on their heads filled with the deity's favourite margosa leaves. Many carry a cock for offering. Middle‐aged women carry large pots of burning charcoal, usually dancing wildly and careening in and out of the crowd at the side of the road. A few vow‐keepers have undergone a special ordeal and have a weapon penetrating their tongue or their cheeks. Young men often have a shrine‐like structure or kavati built around them and anchored to their skin by 30 or 40 wires. Skilfully dancing along through the crowd with feathers, flowers, and weapons all flying about, these shrine‐carriers stir the crowd into 'oos' and 'ahs' of reverence. Finally, the heroic champions of the worship are the 'hook swingers,' who come along the road suspended from a long boom and held by a hook through a muscle in the back. Holding a child up to be blessed by one of these heroes, as they are swung about above the crowd, provides the richest benefit of all.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"As the more heroic of these vow‐keepers make their way along the crowded roadway, they have a whole group of people assisting them, much as handlers assist a prizefighter. Usually one person dances gently ahead, leading the party through the crowd. Then come the drummers, who set a beat consistent with the spirit of the vow‐keeper. Then come one or two other people holding up the vow‐keeper, who is often in a semiconscious swoon. Others follow, carrying the water constantly thrown over the vow‐keeper and the fuel for the firepots, and so on. The movement of the worshiper is usually sporadic. Standing in the midst of the crowd in the blazing summer sun, eyes glazing over, he or she seems for a time to collapse into the arms of the handlers, until, suddenly, the body stiffens and the worshiper, as if possessed, points ahead, and the party goes off at a run. Where the dancing is vigorous, there is a less evident sense of dependence on the handlers, but in this case the supernatural state of mind is equally evident in the wild directions the dance takes. As the dancers enter the presence of the deity, they stuff small metallic 'eyes,' 'arms,' 'legs,' clay 'babies,' cocks, money, jewellery, and 'letters' in the direction of the offering box and then go into a final burst of dance, which often ends in a total swoon. [...] "In the inner sanctum of the Tēvi or Ammaṉ, the atmosphere is actually surprisingly quiet. The drummers, the handlers, and sometimes even the dancers have been stopped some distance back, and only the moans of those recovering from their swoons are sometimes heard. A few worshipers go up as close as they can, and a few others have kept aside offerings of food or of flowers (more appropriate for a Brâhmanical temple), which they hand over to the priests. "Before long the worshipers go out one of the back doors into a whole new phase of the worship, the identification of the 'power' that the Tēvi has given them. The central feature of this phase, in contrast to the energetic 'dance' of the first phase, is the 'trance' of possession, which allows some of the worshipers to become mediums for the others. For many of the worshipers, the possession is a brief moment directly following the swoon in which they feel that they have the answer to their own immediate 'problem' and claim to be 'healed,' to be 'free' of an offending evil spirit, to know the course of action they are to follow, or whatever. When the voice in the possessed person continues to speak in an unearthly hoarseness, however, a crowd quickly gathers around, and individuals begin inquiring of the spirit about their own problems."

"There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...] In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_383_InHoysa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought equates rulers and commoners ♣ absent ♥</b> Caste system.

This is confirmed by Mitra (1965: 49) with quotes from earlier sources, to the effect that ‘the fundamental conception of marriage was monogamous and not polygamous’. M. Basu (2001: 28)summarizes the traditional position: ‘Vedic literature generally endorsed monogamy and [it] was considered the best practice of the highest virtue.

Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition.

Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions - Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sīta. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala."

By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them.

Not all Brahmins have been priests and not all Kshatriyas have been rulers. The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_441_InHoysa] "The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled <i>Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications</i>. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste."

The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have "cast off" from the settled world of "this shore."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_445_InHoysa] However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for not giving food to renouncers. Instead, it seems any punishment or reward was believed to occur through reinarnation: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths. According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life.

These rules from Narada are available in all the texts under review, but Varadaraja and Devana have placed them under steya. One may conclude that while Varadaraja and Devaṇa saw dishonesty by these professional as mere financial bungling, Mṇdhava took their misconduct more seriously." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_447_InHoysa] However, it seems that Hindu Law had only a nominal link to Hindu precepts, and does not therefore count as "human enforcement of morality":  "The growth of law in India may be likened to the evolution of disciplines like grammar, poetics, etymology, and prosody etc. Early speculations on these started in the samhitās and gained strength as auxiliaries to the Vedas. Soon, however, these sciences freed themselves from sacerdotal concerns and came to be established as independent subjects of enquiry, paying only lip service to the authority of the Vedas. The same may be said to be true of law which was an appendage to sacred literature only in the period of the sūtras.

It is the husband’s obligation to protect his wife from external predators and temptations and to invest in a relationship that will sustain her commitment to him and his world. At the same time, it is the obligation of the wife to protect her husband by feeding, caring for him, and investing in a relationship that will sustain his commitment." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_453_InHoysa] However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for mistreating one's parents. Instead, it seems any punishment or reward was believed to occur through reinarnation: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths. According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life. Then, after a certain amount of time, the individual would be reborn on earth once again. The mechanism that regulated this system was karman, a word that literally means "action." Every action must have an effect. So, the effects of one’s actions in life determine what one will experience after death, and what kind of life one will have in the next birth. In this way, even if a person does not seem to receive all the rewards or punishments deserved in a particular life, the scales will be balanced in the future."

First, bravery is never mentioned in the literature as one of the main Hindu virtues. Second, it seems that, in Hinduism, punishment or reward for certain behaviours was believed to occur mainly through reincarnation, not through the action of other humans: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_455_InHoysa]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Referring to commentaries on Hindu law between the eighth and fourteenth centuries CE: "The law on theft in the period under review seems to have been already well settled much earlier. Texts of this period exhibit near unanimity in their presentations. [...] Some of the subjects highlighted in these texts are: definition of theft, types of theft, punishments for various types of theft, collaborators, special laws of evidence to prove theft, liability of the state to compensate for theft and so on and so forth."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_456_InHoysa] However, it seems that Hindu Law had only a nominal link to Hindu precepts, and does not therefore count as "human enforcement of morality":  "The growth of law in India may be likened to the evolution of disciplines like grammar, poetics, etymology, and prosody etc. Early speculations on these started in the samhitās and gained strength as auxiliaries to the Vedas. Soon, however, these sciences freed themselves from sacerdotal concerns and came to be established as independent subjects of enquiry, paying only lip service to the authority of the Vedas. The same may be said to be true of law which was an appendage to sacred literature only in the period of the sūtras.
