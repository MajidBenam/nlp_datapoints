The Justinian Plague struck in 541 and reduced the common population, gradually halting the expansion of the Eastern Empire, and culminating in the usurpations and civil wars of the seventh century. This was followed shortly thereafter by collapse in the Arab Conquests."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Justinian died in 565, leaving a vastly expanded but perilously overstretched empire, in financial as well as in military terms.

Meetings of the emperor's council were infused with an atmosphere of sanctity, and the historian H. W. Haussig has pointed out that many important decisions were in fact 'discussed and settled outside this body'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrERom*] The most important religious official in Constantinople was the patriarch, who was chosen by the emperor;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrERom*] the pope in Rome was the most important of the five patriarchs of the Roman Empire as a whole.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Based in the palatial city of Constantinople, the emperor presided over a large professional bureaucracy that sought to intervene in most aspects of its citizens' lives. Departing from the old pattern of relative Roman disinterest in the formal codification of Roman law, the East Roman emperors in the 395‒631 CE period twice brought together and promulgated official legal codes that were sourced from the empire's Christian era (that is, since the time of Constantine the Great). The first of these was the <i>Codex Theodosianus</i> (439 CE), which was followed by the <i>Codex Justinianus</i> (534 CE). The Eastern Roman Empire also maintained a formal alliance with the Western Roman Empire, meaning that laws promulgated in one half of the empire had to be communicated to the other half and applied in both East and West.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Below the god-emperor was the office of praetorian prefect, which came with considerable temporal powers. The governmental reforms of 395 CE gave this official 'unlimited jurisdiction' on economic matters,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrERom*] which he used to plan the Roman economy in a similar way to that of Egypt, which had been functioning well for six centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrERom*] The praetorian prefect also supervised the postal system and public works, managed the guilds, and ran the production of arms and other manufactured goods as a state monopoly. He was responsible for the <i>annona</i> (food distribution) to the cities and army, and was given license to control prices in the cities and order new industrial production.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrERom*] The government had numerous other officials and departments, including a magister officiorum who, in addition to running the departments of protocol and foreign affairs and the palace guard, was also head of the 'political police (<i>schola agentium in rebus</i>)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 6th century, desperate economic times led to the payment of high officials and soldiers in luxury clothes, while manufactured goods and food were used as currency. Coinage was still in circulation but the proportion used as payment for salaries shrank considerably.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrERom*] The number of residents in Constantinople grew from about 300,000 in 400 CE to 500,000 a century later, but then fell back sharply to about 200,000 due to the troubles of the 6th century. The baseline population of the empire was about 15 million, which peaked at 20 million when times were still good in 500 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Fifth-century Constantinople was a monumental city of great splendour and wealth: it possessed five imperial palaces, six <i>domus divinae Augustarum</i> ('mansions of the divine Augustae') belonging to empresses, three <i>domus nobilissimae</i> (mansions for the top nobility) and 4,388 <i>domus</i> mansions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrERom*] The contemporary source (the 5th-century <i>Notitia urbis Constantinopolitanae</i>) also records 322 streets with 153 private baths.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrERom*] Public buildings included squares, baths, underground cisterns, aqueducts, shops, and entertainment buildings including theatres and hippodromes.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrERom*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Gladiatorial combat was banned as part of Constantine's programme of Christian moral reforms in 325 CE and disappeared sometime in the 5th century.

To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_170_TrERom*] "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_171_TrERom*] "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers. A series of individual acts or turns were presented: these included dancers, wild beasts, clowns, and on occasion, some of the spectators themselves. Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor. It is not certain how these activities evolved over the years, but they were recorded as an important and popular part of the festivities during the tenth century."

"Liturgical ceremonies involve the symbolic use of sensible objects such as bread, wine, water, oil, salt, candles, incense, icons, furnishings (altar, baptismal font), vesture (ecclesiastical costume, baptismal robe), edifices (church, baptistery, skeuophylakeion), and ritual gestures, or actions such as anointing, blessing, signing, bathing or washing, imposition of hands, touching, kissing, dressing or stripping, eating, processions, proskynesis, kneeling, and other postures. [...] The liturgy was usually presided over by a minister in priestly orders (bishop or presbyter) and directed by a deacon who regulated the gestures and posture of the congregation via instructions (diakonika) and announced the intentions of their prayer (litany). [...] Liturgical ceremonies contain both fixed and variable elements. The 'ordinary' is the basic skeleton that remains invariable regardless of the day, feast, or season. The texts of the ordinary express a service's changeless purpose; for example, vespers is always evening prayer. The 'proper' comprises those pieces (lections, hymns, psalmody, refrains, etc.) that vary with the day, feast, or season. Christmas Vespers is evening prayer in commemoration of the Nativity.

To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_315_TrERom*] "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_316_TrERom*] "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers. A series of individual acts or turns were presented: these included dancers, wild beasts, clowns, and on occasion, some of the spectators themselves. Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor. It is not certain how these activities evolved over the years, but they were recorded as an important and popular part of the festivities during the tenth century."

It refers, most often, to the restraining of the specifically sexual appetites of the body, reflecting the word’s Latin root, ‘’castus’’ (‘pure’) which also has from ancient times retained a meaning of abstinence from sexual and other sensual activities. [...] With respect to sexual purity, chastity may refer in practical terms either to a complete abstention from all sexual activity (as in the case of monastics, or as the Orthodox Church expects of all persons prior to marriage), or to the right ordering and sacred engagement of the sexual appetites within the sacramental bond of married life. But chastity as a notion is often employed to the whole spiritual and bodily demeanor of purity before God, and is not simply referring to the sexual appetites. The curbing of any and all passionate impulses may be enjoined under the call to chastity (which is why, for example, it is included as the first positive petition in the famous prayer attributed to St. Ephrem and used throughout the Great Fast); thus chastity may relate to a right practice of patience, godly conversation, the fostering of right social attitudes and activities, the refraining from gossip and slander, etc. [...] Chastity may therefore be seen as the overarching virtue of rightly ordering one’s life and activities, bodily as well as spiritually, so that the other virtues might be realized and God’s temple, the human person, made a fitting home for its King.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_472_TrERom*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “The warmth of relations between parents and children is often stressed in Byz. literature—in evident disregard for the demans of some rigorists (e.g. the author of the vita of St. Alexio homo Dei) who praised the dissolution of family ties.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_473_TrERom*] At the influential Synod of Gangra (ca. 340-342), "The council’s anathemas were promulgated against the following beliefs: [...](14) that women should abandon their husbands in contempt of marriage; (15) and (16) that parents should abandon children and children abandon their parents for asceticism; [...]"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_474_TrERom*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> Based on the following quote, it appears that, though bravery in defence of Christianity was seen as praiseworthy, good Christians were not supposed to engage in physical conflict, so that even soldiers, however brave, were sometimes condemned for their actions on the battlefield.  “To the Byz., peace and violence were ideals rooted in the teachings of the New Testament and church fathers (esp.

The epitimion was “a penalty imposed on a penitent by the priest following sacramental confession. The term was already in use by the 4th C. (Basil the Great, PG 32:721A). As a rule these penitential exercises, mentioned in Byz. canonical and ascetical literature, presupposed repentance and consisted of prayer, fasting, Scripture reading, prostrations, almsgiving, and, on occasion, temporary exclusion from the Eucharist. They were distinguished by their largely positive character and relative mildness from such formal punishments (‘’timoriai’’) as excommunication, suspension, or deposition, which were inflicted by the church for more serious transgressions such as heresy or apostasy. Since sin was understood as a disease rather than a legally punishable crime, ‘’epitimia’’ in Byz. penitential practice and theology were viewed as corrective remedies, that is, as a form of spiritual healing.
