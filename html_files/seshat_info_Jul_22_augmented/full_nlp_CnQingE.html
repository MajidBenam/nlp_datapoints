The peak of Early Qing dynasty is generally defined as the period between regime of Kangxi to Qinglong[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Even during the Kangxi reign period the Manchus' military prowess was declining rapidly. As they settled into a peaceful empire, the skills of riding and shooting were hard to maintain."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"China at the end of the eighteenth century was a vast, wealthy empire led by an assured and generally competent ruler. It was not well-integrated, however, making its whole actually less than the sum of its parts."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Conquest was primarily about the Qianlong emperor's personal power, not the state's, and so the heights of power he attained did not continue for long after he died. With the retrospective decline of Qing power from the Qianlong emperor's peak,it seems as if the longest-ruling emperor in Chinese history took his power with him to the grave."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>Temporal bounds</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1644-1796 CE ♥</b>[Reign Title: English Reign Title/ English Personal Name (Chinese Reign Title/ Chinese Personal Name/ Chinese Temple name)]1644 CE- 1661 CE: Shunzhi/Fulin Emperor (順治/福臨/清世祖)1662 CE - 1722 CE: Kangxi/Xuanye Emperor (康熙/玄燁/清聖祖)1723 CE - 1735 CE: Yongzheng/Yinzhen Emperor (雍正/胤禛/清世宗)1736 CE - 1795 CE: Qinglong/Hongli Emperor (乾隆/弘曆/清高宗)1796 CE- 1820 CE: Jiaqing/Yongyan Emperor (嘉慶/顒琰/清仁宗)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The Qianlong emperor ruled for the longest period in Chinese history. He "retired" as emperor in 1796 so as officially not to exceed the length of his grandfather's 61-year reign, but continued to rule in fact until his death in 1799."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In the 1580s power began to shift among the Jurchen tribes, moving away from confederation under the leadership of the chieftain sanctioned by the Ming. A Ming force intervened to attack that chieftain's rival and restore the status quo, in the process also killing a father and son of the Aisin Gioro lieage. The Ming recognized Nurhaci, the eldest male orphan of the son, as the legitimate inheritor of his father's title. Nurhaci immediately set out to revenge himself upon the man who had advised the Ming commander to intervene, effecting his death three years later and establishing himself as a successful leader. In 1589 the Ming officially designated him comander-in-chief of the Yalu region, acknowledging his actual strength. His rise to power did no go unchallenged. A two-year conflict with other Jurchen tribes concluded with Nurhaci's decisive victory at Jaka on the Hun River in 1593. After allying with the Western Mongols, he destroyed or incorporated most of the remaining Jurchen tribes over a 20-year-period."

The founders of the Qing were descendants of Jurchen Jin rulers. The dynasty was founded by Nurhaci and then led by his son Huang Taiji, but did not become an imperial Chinese dynasty until after Huang Taiji's death.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CnQingE] In 1644 CE, Qing forces captured the Ming capital at Beijing from rebels and held a funeral for the last Ming emperor to symbolize Qing inheritance of the Mandate of Heaven.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnQingE][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Qing faced conflict with rebels and loyalist Ming forces for the next two decades.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CnQingE] Ming generals who surrendered were given power over large territories in southern China in exchange for loyalty to the Qing. In 1673 CE, leaders from three major southern feudatories led by Wu Sangui rebelled against Emperor Kangxi when he tried to reduce their power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CnQingE] The Revolt of the Three Feudatories, as this episode is known, lasted eight years.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We divide the Qing Dynasty into two, an Early period (1644-1796 CE) and a Late period (1796-1912 CE). The division is marked by a period of internal turmoil as well as foreign incursions into its territory and economic sphere.

The Old Summer Palace was known for its extensive collection of garden and building architectures and other works of art. Nearby and to the south was an extensive imperial hunting park known as "Nanyuan". In 1860 during the Second Opium War, two British envoys, a journalist for The Times and their small escort of British and Indian troopers met with the Royal Prince under a flag of truce to negotiate.

Year celebrations would have lasted about two weeks, and they were mostly devoted to visiting relatives and sharing meals with them, as well as exorcistic rituals [MAJIDBENAM_REF_346_CnQingE]. They reached their euphoric culmination in the Lantern Festival. "Although the displays associated with the two-week lantern festival in the first month had been shifted to several locations in the Outer City [of Peking], this holiday remained a protracted period of consumption of food, goods, and entertainment. A fair was gradually reconcentrated at Liulichang, the site of a nearly abandoned tile-production workshop for which the area was named. Although 'a hundred goods gathered like clouds' and performers were everywhere, this new year's fair was best known for its status-making antiquities and books--goods for whom buyers were both sufficiently rare and sufficiently numerous to sustain this kind of once-a-year occasion.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Several temples in the Liulichang area took advantage of the new year holiday and opened their courtyards to vendors (for a fee). Stalls selling jewelry and precious stones were located in a small Fire-god temple restored in 1776 by the Gendarmerie because of the dangers of fire in this crowded quarter. An Earth-god shrine rented its space to book and antique dealers. Booksellers from different parts of the empire prayed and gave thanks at the nearby Wenchang lodge, named after their patron."

One could not apply for palace exams without having passed metropolitan exams, for metropolitan exams without having passed provincial exams, and for provincial exams without having passed local exams. All types of exams took place in prison-like compounds designed to curb cheating, all four involved questions regarding Confucian classics, poetry and national policy issues, and all four caused heightened anxiety in candidates [MAJIDBENAM_REF_409_CnQingE]. The palace exam has been chosen as the most dysphoric simply because its stakes were highest. "The exams were state occasions. Held triennially, the <i>jinshi</i> event constituted a high point in the capital's calendar with thousands participating, thousands more providing tutorial support, sustenance and encouragement, and yet more working as invigilators, scrutineers and assessors. To preclude cheating, each candidate was installed in his own wooden cubicle. His desk by day served as his couch by night, and for better supervision the lines of cubicles lay open along one side, like a row of latrines. Responsibility for the exam rested not with the Ministry of Personnel but the Ministry of Rites, and <i>jinshi</i> literally meaning 'presented shi', it included a final viva in the presence of the emperor himself. Once again, ritual underlay the whole system. Scholars, just like tribute-bearers, supposedly conformed to the cosmic pattern of attraction, being drawn into the imperial orbit by its sheer centrality. Their attendance affirmed its legitimacy and their distinction added lustre to its brilliance." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_410_CnQingE] "The anxiety from preparing for the Keju exams [which resulted in a <i>jinshi</i> degree] and the disappointment of doing poorly on them led to incidents of pathological behavior. Repeatedly failing the Keju exams took a severe psychological toll on the failed candidates. Effects of failure ranged from mild cases of self-doubt to various psychopathologies and, in some cases, to suicide or physical violence directed at others. In her analysis of classic exam-related novels, Judith Zeitlin found that physicians during the Ming dynasty had identified a specific form of anxiety-depression, called by these physicians <i>siyu</i> and referred to as 'male anxiety' by Benjamin Elman, that is associated with repeatedly failing the Keju exams. In the general literature, there have been many recorded cases of problems of delusions, illusions, and insanity attributed to failing the Keju exams repeatedly."

However, Elman [MAJIDBENAM_REF_420_CnQingE] also writes that "An unstated gender bias extended to all women and eunuchs" and that the "rhetoric of impartiality and egalitarian classical ideals successfully suppressed the reality of the unequal chances of candidates in the civil service. Success on the civil examinations evolved as a prerogative of the wealthy and powerful in local communities. In the contest for local quotas and examination success, artisans, peasants, and clerks  were poorly equipped to take advantage of the alleged openness of the civil ser vice.

Control Yuan and Nine Gates Infantry Commander reported petitions to the emperor twice every year, while most of the petition did not get through the procedure to the emperor due to local governor’s attempt to patch up a quarrel or seek self-preservation. Filing petition was hence risky and might cause political persecution (being regarded as false accusation).

These expenses were far beyond the magistrate’s nominal salary to cover. The magistrate could meet these expenses by conducting “objectionable practices” or customary fees (lougui). Members of the Chinese bureaucracy tried to collected fees from every imaginable occasion to cover their expenses. Although the fees sounded to be low and irregular, it had become widely accepted and authorized. It was within the tolerance of the law and within the custom of society. But in reality, there was often no distinction between collection of customary fees and corruption. The system had been remained the standard practice to the end of the dynasty. At the provincial levels, there were some attempts made to regulate the practice by listing fees that were permissible. Nevertheless, they never succeeded simply because all levels of officials depended on customary fees which could be charged in numerous ways. The central government had never made any attempt because it hesitated to increase the tax rate. An increase in the tax rate sounded anti-Confucian as the Chinese classical explicitly advocated low taxation to reduce burdens of the Chinese people.

Just which of them were available at the early period (before the T'ang dynasty) in Chinese translation is a subject for another investigation, but there is no doubt that they were fairly numerous. And in any case, aside from the question as to whether a particular sutra would have been known outside of the professional religious community, it seems safe to assume that one of the most effective themes of Buddhist evangelism among the lay people would have been the punishment of evil in purgatory-however literally or psychologically that purgatory was taken. [...] It must be admitted that the Chinese hardly contributed anything to the structure or the punishments of purgatory, but simply took over literally the ideas that had arrived from India."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_594_CnQingE] <i>The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_595_CnQingE] </i>The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_596_CnQingE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of fairness ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_611_CnQingE] </i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_612_CnQingE]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

Similarly, it says, a government minister should speak to his ruler and offer advice and criticism. If after three attempts the ruler continues to ignore the min- ister, the minister should resign.

The term goes back to the Bronze Age (and is not exclusive to Confucianism - indeed, virtually every Chinese ethical tradition had a concept of filial piety), but before Confucius it had referred to reverence for all ancestors, and mostly had to do with due sacrifice on their behalf. As with so many other moral and religious terms, Confucius and his followers radically reinterpreted it 5 to mean appropriate behaviour visà-vis one’s parents, and not only after their death. Merely providing sustenance was immediately disparaged as grotesquely inadequate: ‘Ziyou [i.e. the disciple Yan Yan, b. 506 bce] asked about filial piety. The Master said: “What is ‘filial’ nowadays refers to the ability to feed [one’s parents]. Even dogs and horses can be fed.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_633_CnQingE] In Daoism: “From the very beginning of the written tradition of Taoism, there existed a close relation between it and Chinese military and practice. The ‘’Daode jing’’ contains passages that propounded ideas about the nature of warfare (that weapons are inauspicious implements; desolation follows an army) and the proper way for the ruler to engage in combat (conquer strength by manifesting weakness; do not value victory; do not attempt to dominate the world by force of arms) that were immensely influential in later times. [...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_634_CnQingE] Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures.

In the yahang system inherited from the Ming dynasty, local brokers had to pay for licenses (yatie) issued by the central government. Licenses were in theory the only middlemen authorized to arrange sales for certain widely used commodities- which even varied from regions to regions- generally including grain, wine vegetables, cloth, and livestock. Yahang charged small commission fees, customarily 5&nbsp;% or less of the value of merchandise, divided between buyer and seller. The yahang system provided possibilities for corruption and abuses. Yahang enjoyed monopoly privileges in local markets, as they could in effect fix prices. Licensed brokers were, theoretically speaking, accountable to the state for the rates they charged, and the token tax payments they remitted. As the central government had a limited control over the local level, the system was used to be involved in local market and to strengthen central government surveillance of county-level finance. Through the system, the government was roughly informed of the bureaucratic control over the prices, personnel, and organization of the vast rural marketing systm.
