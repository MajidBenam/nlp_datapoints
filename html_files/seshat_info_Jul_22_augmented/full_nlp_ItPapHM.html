[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Peak Date ♣ 1240 CE ♥</b>   Innocent III was the king maker of Christendom (e.g. Frederick, in 1214 CE): "In the eleventh century, emperors had appointed popes without consulting any Roman prelate. Now the pope had chosen an emperor." "This was not the last "political" conflict, or victory, during Innocent's pontificate. Innocent was involved in disputes with King Philip II of France .... and with King John of England .... He won resounding victories in both cases. ... King John gave England as a fief to the papacy, and Philip was forced to choose Ingeborg as queen. In a short time, Innocent had twice chosen an emperor and won battles with the other two major states in western Europe, as well as victories over smaller states, like Portugal and Castile. To a greater degree than any pontiff before or since, Innocent achieved the dream of Gregory VII and became, in fact as well as in theory, the undisputed leader of Christendom."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItPapHM] "If Gregory saw himself as the agent of Peter, with whom he had a sense of a powerfully intimate kinship, Innocent viewed himself explicitly as the vicar of Christ, priest and king, who possessed unrivaled temporal and religious authority."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItPapHM] "Papal power and control had reached its height" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapHM] - context of discussion Louis IX of France c1240 CE (?).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1198-1309 CE ♥</b>  In this period the Papacy, from Innocent III, extended its power over the temporal realm, and over Christendom. The period ends with the Angevin exile from 1309 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"It would be the job of Roman canonists, legates, and Popes in the wake of Innocent's pontificate to develop just that machinery, to seize traditional local and episcopal power, and even to create business for the pope, thereby making Innocent's dreams real in practice. (Some of these activities were under way by the time of Innocent's pontificate, but they grew after his death, sometimes by orders of magnitude.) Future cannons and popes achieved these dreams primarily by developing the canon law, by convoking western councils, by hearing thousands of cases in Rome from litigants streaming in from all over Europe, by seizing oversight in the canonization of saints, and by taking over appointments to ecclesiastical offices, and by providing other papal benefits. All of this would have been impossible without the general acceptance that the pope was the vicar of Christ and the growing sense of Christians, nourished by the reforms of the eleventh century, that they were part of a supranational entity, Christendom (Christianitas), and that their primary loyalty was to that body and to the pope as head of Christendom, rather than to any local, regional, or even national entity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ nominal; loose; confederated state; unitary state ♥</b>  "The centralization of the church had also resulted in its bureaucratization. The church at its center seemed less like a religious body and more like a governmental institution; the pope was not the spiritual leader of Christendom but a man of business, a lawyer. His aims seemed less governed by a religious agenda than a political one. And, always, he was asking for more and more money."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItPapHM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>RC: The Papal states in this period fluctuated repeatedly between 3, or all 4 degrees of centralization. It had various factions of feudal noble vassals, ecclesiastical bureaucrats, and factions of Roman families, and the power dynamics between these forces and the papacy greatly affected the degree of centralization.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b>Armies of the Papal States were a conglomeration of international allies, friendly towns and nobles, volunteer crusaders, and the forces directly raised by the pope.

By the fifteenth century, the papacy ceased to function as a universal power and more and more like another regional Italian prince jealously guarding his fiefdom."

He initiated several crusades and presided over the Fourth Lateran Council[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItPapHM] that defined an important Catholic ritual, the Eucharist.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Innocent III "viewed himself explicitly as the vicar of Christ, priest and king, who possessed unrivaled temporal and religious authority"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItPapHM] and this combined with a "general acceptance that the pope was the vicar of Christ and the growing sense of Christians, nourished by the reforms of the eleventh century, that they were part of a supranational entity, Christendom (Christianitas), and that their primary loyalty was to that body and to the pope as head of Christendom, rather than to any local, regional, or even national entity."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItPapHM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Armies of the Papal States were a conglomeration of international allies, friendly towns and nobles, volunteer crusaders, and the forces directly raised by the pope.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapHM] The papal state formed many alliances with during this period, held the nominal allegiance of some polities (the Norman duchies to the south are just one good example of both of these), and held vassals of its own (albeit ones that were notoriously difficult to control). War with the Holy Roman Empire characterised the Papal State's international relations.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Based at the Lateran Palace in Rome, the Papal bureaucracy consisted of scribes, archivists, tax collectors, papal messengers, and administrators charged with the upkeep of the city[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItPapHM] which at this time was no greater than the size of a large town, with about 35,000 inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Joe Figliulo-Rosswurm ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=ItPapHM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 44,000 ♥</b> km2.

The urban population was free, and the town walls (often built by the bishops) were refuges.

The aristocratic, land-holding stratum of Byzantine Italy emerged following Justinian's 6th-century reconquests.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_ItPapHM][MAJIDBENAM_BR] By the late seventh century, many sources speaks of this stratum, which Noble has described as forming "the key social class in late Byzantine Italy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_ItPapHM] These landholders, often of eastern origin, acquired land through leasing them from bishops contractually.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_ItPapHM]</div></div></div></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 6 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At time of Concordat of Worms (1122 CE). "Now the clergy were organized in a hierarchical line under the direction of the pope, who could trump the power of local custom, tradition, and even episcopal power. Below the pope stood the bishop. Responsible for maintaining clerical discipline and for overseeing the property of the church, he was answerable only to the pope. Only he could perform all the sacraments; he alone performed the sacrament of confirmation and by the sacrament of ordination passed on his power to others. Theoretically, canon law held that he would be elected by the clergy and people of his diocese. In practice, he was elected only by the canon priests attached to the cathedral. Considered high clergy, the canons aided the bishop in furthering his agenda, administering the diocese and performing rituals at the cathedral church. At their head was the dean, the highest officer in the diocese. A diocesian chancellor supervised the cathedral school and issued licenses allowing clerics to teach and preach in the diocese. A treasurer oversaw finances, while a precentor managed the choir and organized the cathedral's musical program. Each diocese was divided into administrative districts, over which presided the archdeacons. Practically, these were powerful men; they were the bishop's legates, charged with enforcing discipline among the lower clergy, and therefore they were often quite unpopular. ... The parish priests were answerable to them."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_61_ItPapHM][MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Pope[MAJIDBENAM_BR] From Innocent III, title "Vicar for Christ" became standard.

Popes were now without doubt the heads of the churches and the entire body of Christians, called Christendom (Christianitas).

It was a smashing success: the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani estimated that 200,000 pilgrims in Rome for the Jubilee.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_206_ItPapHM][MAJIDBENAM_REF_207_ItPapHM] While Villani's number, like those of all medieval chroniclers, is a estimate, it indicates the widespread popularity of the ritual. There were enough pilgrims in the city that we have several accounts of people being crushed and trampled to death at particularly popular sites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_208_ItPapHM] Pilgrims visited the major cult centers around the city, offering gifts; there is a notorious scene in an anonymous chronicler's account in which two clerks stood outside St. Peter's Beyond the Walls with large rakes, gathering up the coins offered by pilgrims.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_ItPapHM]"The medieval Roman Jubilee was a year-long celebration of penitence during which pilgrims visited Rome's most important churches and gained plenary indulgences. From its inauguration in 1300, the Holy Year developed through the combined interests of late medieval popes, Roman citizens, and pilgrims. Popes sought to amplify Rome's importance in an era of over-confident kings and emperors; Romans battled for their economic welfare and for ownership of the papacy itself; and pilgrims beset by war and pestilence searched for the complete spiritual cleansing that the Jubilee's plenary indulgence offered. "According to the legend recorded by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi, the Holy Year initially drew its inspiration from a Hebrew tradition recorded in Leviticus in which every fifty years the Jews remitted each others' debts. Stefaneschi wrote of how in 1300 a multitude of millenarian-inspired pilgrims thronged to Rome. In response, Boniface VIII's advisors devised a Christian version of the biblical jubilee. On February 22, the pope declared that each one-hundredth year (centesimo) Rome would host a year of penitential pilgrimage. During this solemn celebration, Christians who visited the Roman shrines dedicated to the church's foremost Apostles, Saints Peter and Paul, would be awarded a plenary indulgence. This 'grand pardon' was a thorough remission of the temporal debt a Christian acquired through sinning. The general understanding was that it promised immediate admission into heaven upon death provided that the pilgrim sinned no further. As with all indulgences, the plenary depended upon the Treasury of Merits earned by Christ and the saints, made visible in Rome's multiple relics. Previously, the plenary had been available only to crusaders. At the time, Boniface was embroiled in conflict with the aggressive King Philip IV of France. Offering Jubilee pilgrims the plenary indulgence highlighted the penitential significance of Rome's relics of Peter and Paul, as well as the pope's central authority in spiritual matters. "To gain the Jubilee plenary, a pilgrim was required to have sincere contrition, perform the sacrament of confession, and visit St Peter's basilica and the basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls for a specified term of days -- fifteen for foreigners, thirty for Romans. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani attested to seeing the peaceful throngs of pilgrims from all over Christendom, 'with much patience, and without noises or quarrels,' crowding Rome's streets, all intent on penitential devotion. The biggest attraction was the Veronica Veil, or Sudarium, an ancient cloth imprinted with the 'true likeness' (vera icona) of Christ and housed at St Peter's."

Priests initially gathered children about to be baptized to attend a given church service, on the Saturday before the fifth Sunday of Lent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_252_ItPapHM] The childrens' godparents-elders sworn to educate the children in the rites and precepts of Christianity-attended this ritual with them. This would occur, in cities, at the main cathedral, the Duomo; in the countryside, at the pieve or parish church. During this ritual, priests and their assistants exorcised the unbaptized children, giving them the sign of the cross; these exorcisms were repeated over several weeks.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_253_ItPapHM] Several more stages followed, but the main rite occurred on Easter Sunday. During high Easter service, the bishop blessed the baptismal font's water, and then performed the first three baptisms of the day.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_254_ItPapHM] Those being baptized seem to have been immersed in the baptismal font thrice, invoking the Trinity; upon completing baptism, the children were then confirmed, that is, affirmed their assent to the basic teachings of Christianity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_255_ItPapHM] Baptism remained the fundamental rite, which created new Christians. Baptism was carried out in the cities in the mother-church, the Duomo; in the countryside, parish churches (<i>pievi</i>), staffed by a college of priests, performed the ceremony.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_256_ItPapHM] The ritual made natural-born children into Christians, and thus members of the official cult. So central to the cult was baptism that, in extreme situations, lay people could baptize children, especially if the child was in immediate danger of death. Baptism forgave sin, original or that done by the person in question.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_257_ItPapHM] Baptism was irrevocable, and those who renounced it were ipso facto apostates from Christianity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_258_ItPapHM] Infants dying unbaptized were, according to orthodox Catholicism, doomed to go to Limbo, somewhere between Purgatory and Heaven.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_259_ItPapHM] Because of this, denial of the necessity of efficacy of baptism became an increasingly frequent element in heretical beliefs from the twelfth century onwards. For dissidents' rejection of the necessity of baptism, see:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_260_ItPapHM] note that none of these heretics were in Lazio or Rome. The ritual was, during this period, communal. Priests initially gathered children about to be baptized to attend a given church service, on the Saturday before the fifth Sunday of Lent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_261_ItPapHM] The childrens' godparents-elders sworn to educate the children in the rites and precepts of Christianity-attended this ritual with them. This would occur, in cities, at the main cathedral, the Duomo; in the countryside, at the pieve or parish church. During this ritual, priests and their assistants exorcised the unbaptized children, giving them the sign of the cross; these exorcisms were repeated over several weeks.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_262_ItPapHM] Several more stages followed, but the main rite occurred on Easter Sunday. During high Easter service, the bishop blessed the baptismal font's water, and then performed the first three baptisms of the day.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_263_ItPapHM] Those being baptized seem to have been immersed in the baptismal font thrice, invoking the Trinity; upon completing baptism, the children were then confirmed, that is, affirmed their assent to the basic teachings of Christianity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ monthly ♥</b> This is a rough median between weekly and once a year, i.e., between baptizing all newborns in a given parish and the much more formal baptism ceremony on Easter Sunday.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_265_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Reading "participant" as the person being baptized; counting godparents as participants, it may have been more frequent.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ monthly ♥</b> This is a rough median between weekly and once a year, i.e., between baptizing all newborns in a given parish and the much more formal baptism ceremony on Easter Sunday.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_266_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1 ♥</b> hour.

principle was widely accepted; indeed, its centrality is shown by the variety of dissenting opinions recorded all over Christendom regarding transubstantiation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_304_ItPapHM] and in

these seem to have usually been part of funeral or wedding masses.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_305_ItPapHM] During this emphasis greater emphasis was laid on Christ's presence in the host, as part of the wider

Masses for the dead became a major aspect of late medieval religiosity, with endowments for masses for the dead becoming an important part of testamentary culture. Swanson has argued that, in general, evidence for lay peoples' awareness of what was happening at Mass "suggests an emphasis on the 'magical' and the meditative."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_308_ItPapHM] Mass was the major quotidian ritual of Christendom. The central ritual within the broader ritual of the Mass was the sacrament of the Eucharist. By the canons of Lateran IV, all the laity were required to receive the Eucharist, and thus attend Mass, at least once a year, on Easter.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_309_ItPapHM] Parish priests were supposed to say Mass daily, but the attendance of the laity, as the canon just discussed would indicate, was not required.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_310_ItPapHM] Because of the increasing importance attached to it on the part of the central ecclesiastical authorities during this period, we have more information on it than for the previous polity period. The sacrament of the Eucharist became central to the Mass after Lateran IV upheld the principle of transubstantiation, the principle that when the officiating priest elevated the wine and host, they became the body and blood of Christ.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_311_ItPapHM] This does not mean that the principle was widely accepted; indeed, its centrality is shown by the variety of dissenting opinions recorded all over Christendom regarding transubstantiation.

Thompson cites numerous statutory evidence showing that in central Italy, city-states closed courts and farmers took days off for saints' days.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_370_ItPapHM] Some city-states, such as Florence, gave amnesties to debtors on the city's patron saint day, and other acts of charity were practiced.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_371_ItPapHM] Feast days typically included a ritual procession, mass for the entire community, and feasting, singing and dancing.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_372_ItPapHM] Thompson has noted, writing of the central Italian cities, that patron saints' days usually fell in the summer to provide good weather for outdoor parties. Other activities might include pageant plays, parades, and singing, with some of these organized by religious confraternities, (Thompson 2010) citing evidence from 1208 Piacenza, just to the north-west of the Papal State.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_373_ItPapHM] Generally speaking, these festivals were the occasion for a temporary relaxation of the social order, and marked both religious festivals and changes in the agricultural year, such as Midsummer and Rogationtide.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_374_ItPapHM] Wickham (2015) notes, however, that at least a few of the rituals described in Benedetto's 12th-c. guide to the Roman liturgy had their roots in fourth-century Christian celebrations, or even pre-Christian, pagan roots.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_375_ItPapHM] Suffice to say, the city of Rome was saturated in liturgical events and places.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ monthly ♥</b> Each feast day was celebrated at Rome with a full liturgy, in a given church or papal basilica.

At its peak, this movement attracted up to 10,000 people throughout Europe, though it was disapproved by the authorities, both secular and religious, who threatened flagellants with the death penalty and excommunication. Official disapproval stemmed from the movement's pacifist tendencies. "Con tal nome sono designate sette religiose, diffuse nell'Europa dal sec. XIII al XV, e caratterizzate appunto da un'intensa e continua mortificazione del corpo mediante flagellazione eseguita pubblicamente: accanto all'idea che la flagellazione sia mezzo penitenziale (S. Pier Damiani, S. Domenico il Corazzato) affiora la convinzione che sia anche un mezzo espiatorio per impetrare dal cielo la pace e la cessazione dei malanni come la peste e la guerra. I più noti, e forse i primi, sono i flagellanti che si diffusero, verso la metà del sec. XIII, nell'Italia centrale e settentrionale, a Perugia (1260), Roma, Bologna, Parma, ecc. Folle intere di gente, uomini e donne, vecchi e giovani, si unirono ai primi propagatori del movimento, abbandonando le proprie case per formare lunghe processioni, che andavano da una città all'altra, fra preghiere e battiture, seguendo il clero inferiore che portava croce e sacre insegne. L'esaltazione mistica del sanguinoso rito finì col far credere ai flagellanti che la fustigazione operata direttamente, senza mediazione di sacerdozio, avesse da sola la virtù di dare la salvezza all'infuori dei riti carismatici della Chiesa. Il loro numero salì indubbiamente a cifre molto elevate (qualche decina di migliaia di persone); il movimento assunse allora anche un certo aspetto politico, in quanto i flagellanti, predicando la penitenza, predicavano anche l'abbandono delle contese di partito e la pacificazione nelle città; perciò esso divenne così poco accetto ai governanti, che Uberto Palavicino minacciò la forca ai flagellanti che muovevano verso il Piacentino. L'opposizione dei governi e della Chiesa, preoccupata di un simile movimento in cui effettivamente cominciavano a infiltrarsi vecchi residui delle precedenti eresie, pose così rapida fine al flagellantismo. "Ma una vivace ripresa di esso si ebbe a mezzo il sec. XIV, dopo la grande pestilenza che desolò l'Europa. Questa volta, le bande dei flagellanti iniziarono il loro cammino nell'alta Germania, diffondendosi però ben presto in tutta l'Europa centro-occidentale, e anche in Italia; e questa volta erano irreggimentati secondo norme più precise e più minute di quanto non fosse stato nel secolo precedente. Nel 1333 il beato Venturino da Bergamo condusse a Roma un pellegrinaggio di flagellanti, contenendolo però entro lo schema penitenziale; nel 1348-50 in occasione appunto della peste nera vi fu un nuovo pellegrinaggio; e così nel 1379, nel 1392, nel 1399 per la peste e per il terrore dei Turchi. La flagellazione avveniva di regola due volte al giorno e una volte la notte; per 33 giorni veniva effettuata a torso nudo, tutti i flagellanti in circolo, mentre il capo intonava un cantico, ripreso in coro dagli altri. "Ma anche questa volta la setta ebbe effimera vita. Papa Clemente VI intervenne sin dal 20 ottobre 1349, ordinando di arrestare e imprigionare i flagellanti. Il movimento, nonostante il divieto, risorse ancora, al principio del sec. XV, nell'Aragona e specialmente nella Turingia e nella Bassa Sassonia (1414), dove si complicò con l'adesione a taluni dei postulati di Wycliffe; e qua e là ancora apparvero flagellanti anche dopo la metà del secolo."

In questo contesto tutti gli insegnamenti femminili erano caratterizzati da una rigida praticità, e partivano dal principio che 'il silenzio, la laboriosità, la modestia costituivano quelle basi fondamentali dell’educazione delle bambine, che le donne avrebbero dovuto sviluppare durante le loro vite' (Segura Graiño, 2007: 77)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_476_ItPapHM] Translation (E.C.): Discrimination on the basis of sex was a constant element of everyday life, because, though mothers almost always were their children's first teachers, fathers eventually made sure that their sons' education differed from that of their daughters. Though in the first years of life boys and girls received a fairly similar basic education, starting at the age of six or seven, sons then went on to refine their education and skills outside the home, while daughters often stayed with their mothers and their education did not stretch beyond the requirements of domesticity.

"[I]l pater, oltre ad essere capo indiscusso della casa, era infatti dominus assoluto del patrimonio familiare, che si componeva di diversi cespiti, tra i quali la dote, ossia il vero perno della struttura patrimoniale della famiglia. La dote che la donna recava con sé al momento del matrimonio, e con la quale si contribuiva al sostegno degli onera matrimonii, vale a dire il sostentamento giornaliero della stessa famiglia, sarebbe dovuta essere “congrua”, e tale parametro di valutazione veniva calcolato ricorrendo a due coefficienti, quali la qualitas personarum e la quantitas patrimonii, ovvero, la posizione sociale della famiglia d’origine e della famiglia di destinazione e la consistenza del patrimonio paterno. [...] Ma al contrario, nella realtà, spesso la dote rappresentava una misera porzione del patrimonio di famiglia, il più delle volte caratterizzata da una presunta “inofficiosità”, oppure solamente promessa e mai consegnata, dal momento che per difendere il più possibile l’integrità del patrimonio paterno [...] si cercava di eludere l’obbligo di dotare le figlie, o, in alterativa, di contenerne al massimo il quantitativo; spesso finiva per diventare non solo un’anticipazione delle ragioni ereditarie della sposa, ma per costituire tout court la liquidazione di ogni sua pretesa ereditaria. [...] Le norme statutarie nascevano dall’esigenza di comprimere e limitare, per quanto possibile, i diritti di proprietà della donna allo scopo di riservare i patrimoni ai maschi della famiglia ai quali era affidato il mantenimento dell’onore e del decoro della famiglia stessa."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_477_ItPapHM] "[T]he <i>pater</i> [father], in addition to being the undisputed head of the house, was in fact absolute <i>dominus</i> [master] of the family patrimony, which consisted of various assets, including the dowry, that is, the true pivot of the family's patrimonial structure. The dowry a woman brought with her at the time of her marriage, and which was her contribution to the <i>onera matrimonii</i> [marriage burdens], that is to say the daily needs of the family itself, should have been "congruous" [...]. However, in reality, often the dowry represented a minuscule portion of the family patrimony, more often than not characterized by an alleged "inofficiousness", or only promised and never delivered, since to defend the integrity of the family paternal patrimony as much as possible [...] an attempt was made to evade the obligation to endow the daughters, or, alternatively, to limit the quantity as much as possible; often [the dowry] ended up becoming not only an anticipation of the bride's hereditary claims, but the complete liquidation of all hereditary claims.

Franco Sacchetti, for example, compared th validity of such conversions to the baptism of oxen and argued for a perpetual state of servitude without the possibility of becoming real Christians (‘’Sermoni evangelici’’, 29).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_540_ItPapHM]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Normative_Ideological_Aspects_of_Human_Sacrifice">Normative Ideological Aspects of Human Sacrifice</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=ItPapHM&amp;action=edit&amp;section=69" title="Edit section: Normative Ideological Aspects of Human Sacrifice">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 0 ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human sacrifice of an out-group member ♣ absent ♥</b>  “The [Old Testament] expressly abhors and forbids human sacrifice (Lev. 18:21; 20:2-5; Deut. 12:31-32; 18:10; 1 Kgs. 16:30-34).

Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms. It was taken for granted that the universe was designed in such a way that some of God’s creatures were intended to be at the topand some below them. Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality. Until late in the Middle Ages, few appear to have seen anything wrong with the idea that there should be rulers and ruled, for hierarchical arrangements of parts within wholes were a normal way of making an organism ‘work’. A body needs a head but it also needs feet (I Corinthians 12.20). In fragmentary survivals of the teaching which was given in the cathedral school at Laon at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries, there is a discussion of the passage in Ephesians 6.5 where servants are told to obey their masters. ‘It is no sin to have a servant or to be a servant.’ It was argued at Laon that there are two reasons why ‘servitude is given by God.’ It may be a punishment for the sins of those who are slaves or servants.

Since marriage was a sacrament, the church claimed exclusive jurisdiction over it, appropriating and expanding the laws of nature (Natural Law) and Scripture as well as some of the rules in the early church constitutions and Christianized Roman law. Comprehensive new laws, called canon laws, were promulgated by the papacy and the church councils and enforced by church courts throughout Western Christendom.//”Consistent with the naturalist perspective on marriage, the church’s canon law punished contraception, abortion, and child abuse as violations of the created functions of propagation and child rearing. It also proscribed unnatural sexual acts, such as sodomy and bestiality. Consistent with the contractual perspective, canon law ensured free consnsual unions by dissolving marriages contracted by mistake or under duress, fraud, or coercion. It also granted husband and wife equal rights to enforce conjugal debts that had been voluntarily assumed and emphasized the importance of mutual love among the couple, their children, and their parents.//”Consistent with the sacramental perspective canon law protcted the sanctity and sanctifying purpose of marriage by declaring valid marital bonds to be indissoluble and by annulling invalid unions between Christians and non-Christians or between parties related by various legal, spiritual, blood, or family ties. It supported celibacy by annulling unconsummated vows of marriage if one party made a vow of chastity and by prohibiting clerics on monastics from marriage and concubinage.//”Earlier Christianized Roman and Germanic laws governing the relationships between husband and wife, and parent and child, were liberally appropriated by the canonists and now enforced in the church courts as well as in the confessional (Confession of Sins). Traditional rules and customs of arranged marriages, patriarchal restrictions on the marital estate, male-dominated inheritance laws and primogeniture, protection of the status of the paterfamilias, and restrictions on the wife’s capacity to sue or be sued, to enter into contracts, to give or receive property of her own—all remained firmly in place in canon law.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_580_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> “On the individual level, Augustine counseled nonresistance, hence, nonviolence; he worried that inordinate desires even to preserve one’s own life could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could lead further to evil deeds. augustine knew well the horrors of war and the lusts that war itself incites. Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_581_ItPapHM]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> From the eighth century to the Counter-reformation era, from Scandinavia to France to Italy, Christian penitentials regularly included instructions regarding the kinds of penance clergy should assign to those guilty of the following acts: homicide, perjury, sacrilege, drunkenness, various types of sexual transgressions (including adultery, incest, sodomy and bestiality), sorcery, respect for one's parents, and theft[MAJIDBENAM_REF_582_ItPapHM].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ present ♥</b> E.g. excommunication, inquisition. “In the West excommunication was at the discretion of bishops and the pope until late antiquity.
