The government was headed by a powerful emperor and featured a large central bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnNSong][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Song period saw rapid commercial and industrial expansion.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnNSong] Agriculture, paper-making, printing, and iron-working flourished,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnNSong][MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnNSong] and paper money was first produced in China under the Song.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnNSong] Foreign trade increased as the state expanded its trading networks.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnNSong][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Although it is clear that the Song Dynasty was a period of massive population growth and urbanization,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnNSong] there is some disagreement about exact population numbers.

There were so many torches that it was like daylight. High officials, members of the imperial family and of wealthy and titled families were crowded in serried ranks. When the Emperor mounted his chariot, all lights except those lining the route were extinguished. The imperial procession, led by tame elephants, now came out through the Great Processional Gate and made its way to the altar, near which a host of standards and flags flew. The sound of the imperial guards shouting orders to each other could be heard, and the flicker of torches could be seen against the daybreak. The earth shook with the beat of drums and the solemn sound of trumpets as an immense and silent crowd stood waiting on the open space at the foot of the altar. The court musicians played the ritual music. The Emperor mounted the altar steps, which were covered with yellow gauze (yellow being the colour of the centre and of sovereignty) and sprinkled with pieces of camphor. A victim was sacrificed on the small adjacent altar to the God of the Soil, and then the Emperor, having reached the topmost platform of the altar for the sacrifices to Heaven, offered libations to Heaven, to the August Earth, and finally to his ancestors. To the last, he presented jade tablets along with the ritual wine. He read aloud what was written on these sacred tablets, which were afterwards deposited in the interior of the altar. Then he drank the 'wine of happiness', and, when all was over, he made his way to the buildings that had been erected near the altar in order to change his robes. The officials offered their congratulations. Finally he mounted a ceremonial chariot, different from the one which had brought him to the sacrificial altar.

Those in charge of states, fiefs, and families were privileged and obliged to officiate at rites; those not so privileged were expected to assist in whatever capacity was appropriate to them. The chief sacrificer had to purify himself in advance through abstinence of varying duration. At the appointed time, he would enter the consecrated ancestral shrine, bow, prostrate himself, and make offerings of food and wine. He was assisted by a variety of attendants, including those who prepared the food, took charge of the utensils, performed divinations, and pronounced prayers. During major sacrifices, one boy or man, preferably a son of the chief sacrificer, would act as a vessel for the spirit of the ancestors. This impersonator also needed to undergo purification before the rite. During the rite he would drink the wine offered to the ancestors and in trancelike fashion passively allow the spirits to animate him. A ritual expert would interpret the ancestors' wishes, which in the standard liturgy of the <i>I-Ii</i> was to convey blessings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_392_CnNSong] NOTE: It seems more sensible, here, to exclude "major sacrifices" and only consider the simpler types of ancestor worship: it seems reasonable to infer that the latter occurred more frequently than the former. However, it would be quite easy to change a few key variables from "absent" to "present" should it be decided to incorporate the major sacrifices in this ritual--Cho-Yun and Linduff (1988), in particular, offer a detailed description of these rites.

For the Song, a number of sources provide descriptions of the Lantern Festival, but this was merely the culmination of a period that likely lasted about two weeks, and which involved both rituals that strengthened bonds within families and/or lineages (e.g. visits, feasts), as well as exorcistic rites. The following is a particularly colourful description of the Lantern Festival, as it was celebrated by the Southern Song--it seems reasonable to infer that the Northern Song would have celebrated the New Year similarly. "And indeed, the year had not properly begun, and it was not until the 14th, 15th and 16th of the 1st moon, when the Feast of Lanterns took place, that the beginning of the new year was celebrated in a general overflowing of gaiety and excitement. During this period of three days and three nights, which fell at the time of the full moon, the townspeople [of the capital] ruined themselves by the amount they spent on food and drink. There was a great competition in the matter of decorations and lanterns. [...] From north to south, over a distance of more than eleven miles, the city, seen from the surrounding heights, was like an immense bonfire. "The festival itself had every appearance of a bacchanale. Troupes of dancers, all dressed up, and of acrobats and musicians went about the city. [...] They gave shows in rich people's houses. Twenty-four families who lived near the opening of Officials' Lane and in Su-family Lane gave marionette shows: the actors had new clothes and bead-embroidered caps and wore flowers in their hair. [...] In the big mansions, troupes of children and young musicians played pipes and zither or sang different kinds of songs. It was impossible to move about the streets on account of all the games and shows going on in the open. A shop here or a private house there would be so magnificently decorated with lanterns of all colours that passers-by would form a crowd in the street and block the way. Everywhere could be heard the sound of drums and pipes. [...] Drunkenness was general. And so, when the excitement had calmed down and passers-by had become fewer, before daybreak people with small lanterns in their hands went about the squares, the streets ad the lanes looking for lost property: hairpins, head-ornaments, necklaces, etc. This custom was called 'sweeping the streets'. "In the imperial palace [...] scaffolding was put up which was 150 feet high and was called the 'mountain of the mountain-carrying tortoise'. [...] On top of the scaffolding were official musicians, at the bottom a platform where games and shows of all kinds were performed. The palace women and over a hundred little eunuchs wearing turbans danced in a circle like marionettes. When the show was over, troupes of dancers from the town were allowed in as well as pedlars carefully chosen out by the prefect from among those who had the best street-cries. [...] The palace women scrambled to buy the wares offered by the pedlars, at prices very much higher than they normally were. Some of these pedlars, it was said, had made a fortune in one evening in this way."

"The anxiety from preparing for the Keju exams and the disappointment of doing poorly on them led to incidents of pathological behavior. Repeatedly failing the Keju exams took a severe psychological toll on the failed candidates. Effects of failure ranged from mild cases of self-doubt to various psychopathologies and, in some cases, to suicide or physical violence directed at others. In her analysis of classic exam-related novels, Judith Zeitlin found that physicians during the Ming dynasty had identified a specific form of anxiety-depression, called by these physicians <i>siyu</i> and referred to as 'male anxiety' by Benjamin Elman, that is associated with repeatedly failing the Keju exams. [...] What is more, these psychological and behavioral phenomena are not unique to a certain period of time. Rather, cases like those mentioned were documented throughout the history of the exam and were particularly prevalent after the Song dynasty when the exam became available to the general public and even more highly competitive." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_509_CnNSong] "Severe punishments were meted out for people caught cheating, including being caned or being placed in stocks for a month. There were occasional cases of actual executions of cheaters. By the time of the Song dynasty, large prisonlike exam compounds that could accommodate up to 22,000 or more examinees, complete with armed guards and with thorny bushes planted around the outer walls, were built. During the exams, very strict personal search (including body searches) procedures and very strict exam procedures were followed. Candidates were grouped into small groups responsible for each other’s behavior. Watchtowers were built over and dispersed around the exam compounds. Other measures included strict and precise rules and specifications regarding clothing and very detailed specifications of what items could be brought to the exam compounds. Also included were the sequestering of examiners prior to exams, restricting examinee movements during exams, physically separating exam scorers from exam compound administrators and other staff to prevent the influencing of the scorers’ judgment, forbidding the use of any words or phrases in the essays and poems that would reveal an examinee’s identity, and the separation of the responsibilities for exam administration (Department of Rites) and for subsequent official appointments of successful examinees (Department of Personnel) to minimize corruption. These measures were in addition to the widely known practice of covering the examinees’ name to keep scoring anonymous and employing copyists to copy the examinees’ answers and scoring only the copy to avoid the recognition of handwriting.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_634_CnNSong] <i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_635_CnNSong]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

[...] [The] first of the nine (in Boenkamp’s interpretation of the ‘’wei’’ of *’’wuwei’’ being taken as ‘artificial, contrived, fabricated, false,<i> 1997, 51) insists on lacking falseness, while the sixth of the twenty-seven prohibits practicing false arts.</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_648_CnNSong]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ uncertain_absent_present ♥</b> Confucianism: the importance of adherence to a particular school of thought, such as Confucian versus Legalist, became important part of training of officials, especially after reforms of Wudi and Tung Chung-shu’s principles derived from the ‘5 Classics’.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_649_CnNSong] Traditions also stressed loyalty to lineage group, but many traditions (esp.

Private ambitions must be subordinated to the loyalty one feels. Like filial piety, loyalty could include criticism. Confucius argued that it is one’s duty to object if a ruler is wrong. He said that if one is really loyal, really doing one’s duty, ‘how could you not instruct your ruler?’ As we have seen with filial piety above, criticism is permitted, if done reverently, though the results may be hard on the son or government minister. In a later text, the Book of Ritual, it is noted that a filial son may speak up to criticize his parents three times, but, if ignored, he is to follow their wishes. Similarly, it says, a government minister should speak to his ruler and offer advice and criticism. If after three attempts the ruler continues to ignore the min- ister, the minister should resign. The son cannot escape his relation to his parents, but a government minister is not related by blood to the ruler and so is permitted to leave the relationship if his advice is not taken.<i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_652_CnNSong]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “Even a first and superficial glance makes it clear that purifying, purification and actions or things that are considered pure play a decisive role in virtually all Chinese religions.<i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_653_CnNSong] Some brief notes on purity in Chinese Daoism.

The term goes back to the Bronze Age (and is not exclusive to Confucianism - indeed, virtually every Chinese ethical tradition had a concept of filial piety), but before Confucius it had referred to reverence for all ancestors, and mostly had to do with due sacrifice on their behalf. As with so many other moral and religious terms, Confucius and his followers radically reinterpreted it 5 to mean appropriate behaviour visà-vis one’s parents, and not only after their death. Merely providing sustenance was immediately disparaged as grotesquely inadequate: ‘Ziyou [i.e. the disciple Yan Yan, b. 506 bce] asked about filial piety. The Master said: “What is ‘filial’ nowadays refers to the ability to feed [one’s parents]. Even dogs and horses can be fed. If one is not reverent, wherein lies the difference?’ ( Analects 2.7) If one thinks filial piety consists primarily of feeding one’s parents, and not in cultivating one’s reverence, one is treating them like dogs and horses.</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_654_CnNSong] “Filial piety achieves intellectual prominence as a Confucian concept, but it also informs Daoism and Chinese Buddhism.<i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_655_CnNSong]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> In Buddhism, physical conflict was seen as undesirable, but, at the same time, an often necessary evil. “As we saw in the chapter on Buddhist Ethics (see Chapter 7) right conduct in thought, word and deed is characterised as peaceful and non-harming behaviour. That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.<i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_656_CnNSong] In Daoism: “From the very beginning of the written tradition of Taoism, there existed a close relation between it and Chinese military and practice. The ‘’Daode jing’’ contains passages that propounded ideas about the nature of warfare (that weapons are inauspicious implements; desolation follows an army) and the proper way for the ruler to engage in combat (conquer strength by manifesting weakness; do not value victory; do not attempt to dominate the world by force of arms) that were immensely influential in later times. [...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).</i> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_657_CnNSong] Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures.
