Neither oral traditions nor regional histories compiled in Timbuktu suggest the existence of a Bamana 'king' prior to the 17th century. However, in around 1650, a hunter and warrior called Kaladian Kulibali (or Coulibaly) drew on the indigenous male age-grade associations known as <i>tòn</i> to become the ruler of the first Bamana state,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MlSegou] which briefly included Timbuktu.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MlSegou][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and Political Organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Bamana before the mid-17th century were probably a 'stateless society' — specifically, they may have been divided into independent villages who only banded together in response to a threat.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MlSegou] After a brief period of integration under Kaladian Kulibali, centralized power weakened after his death and an oligarchy of regional rulership by his sons and their successors held sway for some time.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MlSegou] By the time Biton Kulibali rose against the status quo and founded his own Bamana Kingdom in 1712, it seems that the Bamana region was divided into small communities, each ruled by a gerontocracy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MlSegou] However, details are hazy, and mostly derived from oral traditions, so the relationship between Kaladian's successors' loose oligarchy and the gerontocracies of the early eighteenth century is not very clear. We are not certain, for example, whether the former gave way to the latter, or whether the latter existed within the context of the former. No population estimates for the Segu Kingdom could be found in the literature.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MlSegou&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [200,000-300,000] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1750 CE[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Sausage-shaped, covers Niger river from beyond Timbuktu (but stops before the bend to Gao) through the inland delta and beyond to the two tributaries in the uplands, but not getting very far into Guinea and Senegal (if at all - modern borders not marked on map).

Finally, there are the Cikebugu: agricultural hamlets, normally founded by the state. The inhabitants of such hamlets were, notionally, resettled captives taken either in battle or in raids.

This suggests the importance and existence of boliw, or power objects, in the Bamana Empire, and since the latter was the successor polity to the Segu Kingdom, it seems reasonable to infer that boliw worship was practised in the Segu Kingdom as well. Though there is very little information regarding boliw worship in the seventeenth and eighteenth century, there is a rich literature regarding boliw worship in the twentieth century, which may well have been broadly similar. "Fabricated by specialists, the most famous of whom live in the regions of Siguiri (Upper Guinea) and Segu (central Mali), Mande power objects are either inherited within the family or purchased by aspiring owners from a craft master at a price that may be quite elevated. In any event, the acquirer pledges to make offerings and to conduct his life in a particular way in relation to the object’s exigencies. Such requirements comprise, on the one hand, specific sacrificial requests—at particular times/spaces and of a particular nature (including substances such as animal blood, cola nuts, and millet beer)—and, on the other hand, more general obligations, usually regulating sexual activity, diet, and social behavior of the owner or <i>tigi</i>. Disobeying these requirements may result in the loss of the object’s power or, worse, in this power turning against the owner. An owner engages with the object chiefly through sacrifices performed both according to the annual cycle and in the time of need. They begin with formal address—a verbal reminder of the alliance uniting him with the object, usually including a thanksgiving for past assistance and a request for future protection. According to my field experience, then, the owner informs the object of his future plans (or of those of the relative, friend, or fellow villager for whom the sacrifice is being performed) to test the object’s view as to the probability of their realization. First the question is asked: “Will the person who promised me money keep the promise?” or “Will I kill some prey today?” The divination with cola nuts or other augurs—such as stones, cowry shells, poultry, or sand—follows, resulting in what is considered to be the object’s answer to the question. The actual sacrificial act functions within this schema either as the closing stage of the consultation or as the fulfillment of former promises made to the object, and always as a reenactment of the alliance between the object(s) and the human(s). [...] Regardless of its exact purpose, the object’s use is secret—i.e., under customary circumstances, one does not show power objects to others or willingly admit to owning them (although their existence is generally a “public secret”), nor does one publicly discuss their properties."

The ceremony was preceded a night of continuous dancing for the whole of the community. At the ceremony itself, a blacksmith was tasked with performing the surgery. Following the ceremony, the boys were kept in isolation and instructed regarding their new role in society: they had ceased being mere children, and become adult men. Societies of mutual support formed by men who had undergone circumcision together were instrumental for the founding of the Bamana Empire [MAJIDBENAM_REF_220_MlSegou], and since the latter was the successor polity to the Segu Kingdom, it seems reasonable to infer that these societies existed in the Segu Kingdom as well.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> every three years.

[...] Traditional religion's daily expression involves rituals associated with farming, fishing, hunting, and blacksmithing, a system of life-crisis associations with accompanying rituals, and initiation societies (<i>jow</i>) like the <i>Komo</i> (<i>Maninka Koma</i>) that were of profound social and political significance. The <i>Komo</i>, <i>Nyagwan</i>, <i>Ntomo</i>, <i>Nama</i>, <i>Kore</i> and others are village organizations that functioned as regulators and protectors of the community, and as intermediaries between the temporal and spiritual worlds [...]. The latter function involved the use of <i>boliw</i>, portable altars used in ritual sacrifice, some of which are claimed to have been brought from Mecca in the Fajigi tradition that is described below.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Historically, Bamana culture was distinguished from other Mandekan peoples such as the Soninke and Maninka by the relatively slow progress that Islam was able to make against local traditional religion. Muslim families who were mostly of Soninke origin were present in the Bamana Segou state beginning with the time of its founder, Mamary Biton Kulubali (c. 1712-c. 1755), but the rulers (<i>faamaw</i>) and most of the population continued in the traditional system of belief until the burning of the <i>boliw</i> and forced conversions following the Islamic conquest of Al-Hajj Umar in 1861. There were Muslims in Segou from the time of its founding, but the four great <i>boliw</i> were the cornerstones of the state religion and power structure, and the profound faith in their protective qualities doubtless had a good deal to do with the Bamana's extended resistance to Islam. A Segou <i>faama</i> could not govern without control of the four great <i>boliw</i>, which were critical to the acquisition and maintenance of political power. [...] In addition to state-owned <i>boliw</i> and those belonging to initiation societies, there were great numbers of them in the possession of individuals (fig. 7). The <i>boliw</i> received sacrifices in order to call upon and influence the vital spiritual force known as <i>nyama</i>.

"For women, marriage represents a terrifying wrench away from the safety of one’s mother and 'mother-childness.' [...] The women in her new family may view a young bride as a rival, especially if they are older co-wives or even if they are the husband’s 'mothers' assigned to protect, but also carry out surveillance of the new arrival. A young woman needs to have great self-possession, confidence and intelligence to survive whole in such a situation, and the standards by which she is measured are harsh. On the surface she must present an image of hard work, contentment with her marriage partner and agreement with the mother-in-law in whose hut she sleeps and keeps her belongings. Yet, the structural situation often places her in competition with her fellow co-wives for food, money, clothing and above all the husband’s goodwill and preference.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_316_MlSegou]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ punishment of commoners ♣ inferred present ♥</b> The following quote does not specify which category of person could be punished, but it seems reasonable to infer that the majority of the population feared a boli's judgement. "Boliw are large sculptures moulded from what appears to be a deep black putty. [...] The Boliw are the property of and are manipulated by a group of seven or eight old men, who are the ultimate political authority in most Bamana villages. This oligarchy controls the series of male associations to which young men gain access only after circumcision. Initiation into at least one such society is virtually compulsory, and some men choose to enter several out of interest and ambition. The Bamana invariably bring serious disputes and legal cases to the most prominent dignitaries of the local secret association, and it is these elders who bring out the Boli belonging to the association for consultation and judgment. [...] The  secret association's Boli hears the case, divines the culprit, and decrees a sentence. Then the old men translate this verdict to the able-bodied men of the association, who are instructed to carry out the verdict - a mission that may well involve murder. In other cases the elders take matters into their own hands and poison the guilty party. Although it is the elders who hear the case and pass judgment, the Bamana still maintain an unshaken belief in the supernatural power of the Boliw and their ability to kill at long distances by mysterious means."
