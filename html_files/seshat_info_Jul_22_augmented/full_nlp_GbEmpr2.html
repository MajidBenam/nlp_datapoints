Between 1840 and the end of the century, engineers in Britain executed it approximately one hundred times, but the gravitation scheme had a life beyond the bounds of Britain. In the second half of the nineteenth century, engineers—usually the very same individuals who had carried them out in Britain— introduced the scheme to cities such as Bombay, Colombo, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

Describing the actions of Neill's troops around Allahabad, one officer wrote: ‘Every native that appeared in sight was shot down without question, and in the morning Colonel Neill sent out parties of regiment [?) ... and burned all the villages near where the ruins of our bungalows stood, and hung every native that they could catch, on the trees that lined the road.

Just over a century later, fewer than 100,000 remained in 1901, the year of Australia’s federation. Most Aborigines perished from new diseases like smallpox, measles, and tuberculosis, and whites probably killed about 20,000 or more. Blacks also killed possibly 2,500 whites, mostly in isolated attacks, but the killings of Aborigines by settlers and troops, though sporadic, involved much larger numbers. Mass death from unwittingly introduced diseases is not genocide, yet the enormity of that loss cannot obscure the evidence of multiple deliberate killings and a series of genocidal massacres.”e.g. Bathurst settlement “Of the estimated 3,000 Wiradjuri people, three clans totaling 500-600 lived here is mixed woodland and grassland…William Lawson Jr. wrote: ‘We have now commenced hostilities against them in consequence of their killing a great number of shepherds and stockmen, but afraid we shall never exterminate them, they have such an extensive mountainous country for them to flee from their pursuers’...The full Wiradjuri death toll during that year is difficult to determine. Prior to the conflict, in 1815, the three Upper Macquarie clans were estimated to number 500-600, and a July 1824 Wiradjuri assembly near Bathurst, 600-700. How many survived the bloodbath that followed is unclear. On December 11, Brisbane repealed martial law, offering Windradyne a pardon, and on December 28, Windradyne arrived in Parramatta with 140 members “of the Bathurst tribe.”…Historian R.H.W. Reece wrote that "there is reason to believe that every Aborigine who was physically capable of making the journey would have been present.” If so, in six months, Wiradjuri numbers had fallen from 600-700 to as few as 140, plus the elderly, sick, and infants. A surviving population of around 400, including wounded, may be close to the truth. Specific reports of clashes and massacres in 1824 suggest a total toll of over 100 Wiradjuri killed and probably twice that number.” <sup id="cite_ref-142" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-142">[142]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Archaeological proxies:</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Skeletal evidence of violence ♣ uncoded ♥</b> <i>Variable not yet been checked for data or no data yet found in the literature.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mass burials ♣ uncoded ♥</b> <i>Variable not yet been checked for data or no data yet found in the literature.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement destruction ♣ uncoded ♥</b> <i>Variable not yet been checked for data or no data yet found in the literature.</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Pictorial evidence of warfare ♣ uncoded ♥</b> <i>Variable not yet been checked for data or no data yet found in the literature.</i></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="List_of_Wars">List of Wars</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=GbEmpr2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38" title="Edit section: List of Wars">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>NB!

Every twelve years, the mela is known as a Kumbh Mela and is vastly attended; in the intervening six years, the mela is known as Ardh (half) Kumbh (readers unfamiliar with the mela should turn to the appendix, where they will find a useful overview). Pilgrimage in Hindu traditions is not obligatory, but it is meritorious and desirable. In the case of the Kumbh, a bath in the triveni promises superlative benefits, chiefly immortality, but these are only on offer every twelve years; this relative rarity places certain compulsions on pilgrims to take the opportunity of a holy bath when it arises, because it 'may not be possible next time for a pilgrim, given the uncertainty of human life.'" <sup id="cite_ref-143" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-143">[143]</a></sup> The Haridwar Mela "was held annually in April, and every twelve years inflated to the status of Kumbh Mela as the new moon occurred with the sun and moon in Aries and Jupiter in Aquarius (Kumbha). The Haridwar mela was dominant in the British imagination primarily because its accompanying market was a magnet for traders and customers from all over the subcontinent and beyond. The East India Company promptly inserted itself into this strange tableau of commerce and worship, tolerating the latter to take advantage of the former. [...] "The first British account of the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, published in the influential journal Asiatick Researches, describing the 1796 visit of Captain Thomas Hardwicke, remains seminal to understandings of the Kumbh. Hardwicke described the mela as a colorful but chaotic fair, a contradictory mix of devout religious observance and ruthless mercantile opportunity, governed by rival sects (akharas) of militant, unpredictable, and sometimes nude holy men. The scale of the 1796 Kumbh fair was estimated by Hardwicke, in consultation with a Gosain who had access to a register of taxes exacted from pilgrims, at two and a half million people. The mela turned to melee on the final day of the fair, when a large body of Udasis suddenly attacked 'with swords, spears and firearms, every tribe of Fakirs that came in their way,' indiscriminately slaughtering pilgrims, killing at least five hundred souls. The intervention of one Captain Murray, two companies of sepoys, and two six‐pounder cannons forced the attacking akhara into retreat."[...] "The next significant account of the Haridwar mela, buried in a seemingly interminable narration of a survey to discover the source of the Ganges and written by East India Company geographer Captain Francis Raper, was also published in Asiatick Researches. Since Hardwicke's visit, the Saharanpur district in which Haridwar lay had been ceded to the East India Company by the Marathas. Raper relates the 1796 experience and assures the reader that at the 1808 Kumbh Mela, 'to prevent a repetition of such outrages, the detachment assembled for the preservation of peace was this year of greater strength than usual.'

While objects were offered into the fire in the Vedic rites, objects were offered to deities on altars in temple Puja. In the Puja system the items were meant for the enjoyment of the deity rather than as offerings tendered for a tangible (or intangible) benefit of the patron or community. As Davis recounts, 'in Puja, a worshipper invokes or invites the deity into some material form, most often an image or icon visually and symbolically representing the deity, and presents to him both material offerings such as food and clothing and devoted services such as the recitation of his praises, music, dance, and songs. Agama texts classify all these material and performatory presentations to the deity as "services" (Upacara). Vishnu and Siva, as gods simultaneously transcendent and immanent, enter into a variety of both anthropomorphic and aniconic objects so that their devotees may see them and make their offerings of homage.' "In Puja the divine service always takes place in reference to an altar upon which are placed statues or images (Murti) requiring regular worship. Puja in temples and shrines gradually developed into a complicated daily service that was enhanced during special monthly and seasonal observances. Puja is generally centered on pleasing the Lord in the temple with offerings of food, water, incense, flowers, fan, sweets, camphor, lamp wick, unguents, and conch. Music and devotional songs were key items in this arsenal of offerings. While many Pujas continued to include unaccompanied Stuti or Stotra (hymns of praise) to the deities in Sanskrit, they also contained more and more vernacular hymns and songs accompanied by musical instruments."<sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "Many devout Hindus in the modern world still perform Puja once or twice a day.

It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."<sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> Every Friday.

"With respect to the fundamental characteristics of the Vasantotsava as found in the above Sanskrit texts, we can fruitfully focus our attention in four general directions. Firstly, the Spring Festival crosses sectarian boundaries. It is a popular festival celebrated by several sects as well as outside any readily identifiable sectarian context. No main deity or group of deities is here the consistent object of devotion; the Vasantotsava may be celebrated by all, regardless of private or public devotional affiliations. Second, the element of fire appears in some context in almost all descriptions of this festival: it is a symbol of death, renewal, transformation and purification. Third, the significance of the marriage motif with respect to the Vasantotsava is indicated by a number of texts including the Bhavisya Purana (as previously noted). [...] Fourth and finally the rituals of the Vasantotsava revolve, to a greater or lesser extent, around sensuality. The festival is a fertility festival and erotic motifs from both the mortal and the immortal realms are freely combined with fertility motifs. These four components of the Spring Festival will be treated in turn in the sections that follow. "[...] "The eroticism of the spring celebrations as found in the Ratnavali is characterized by a certain amount of social freedom and licentiousness. Thus the Spring Festival is a peculiar mix of control and freedom: the festival occurs within the city under the auspices of kings and Brahmins and at the same time social barriers are purposefully broken down and the erotic permeates the ritual. The breakdown of social relationships is indicated by rituals such as playing 'Holi' (throwing colored powder), mixing of castes and men and women in the streets, sex, licence, and powder. Eroticism and sexual licence as brought out in the throwing of powder and dancing which comprise this festival reflect the sexual potency of the season." <sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-269">[269]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> This festival celebrated is celebrated in the Spring, although its exact dates are unclear <sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-270">[270]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> This festival celebrated is celebrated in the Spring, although its exact dates are unclear <sup id="cite_ref-271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-271">[271]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> This festival celebrated is celebrated in the Spring, although its exact dates are unclear <sup id="cite_ref-272" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-272">[272]</a></sup>.<span style="color:blue"> Thomas Cressy: As the ritual could be celebrated by all, it seems there is no reason to believe the ritual had passive spectator.

"The most common ambulatory ritual observance is dasta, or procession. There is no doubt that the Hosayn dasta was influenced by ritual parades lamenting the unjust and sudden deaths of such heroes as Tammuz in Mesopotamia and Siavos in Transoxania. The dasta in Moḥarram and Safar developed from simple processions into complex rituals occurring annually among Shi'ite communities worldwide. The most notable feature of the dasta is the self-mortification of the participants in tandem with accompanying cymbals and drums. Marchers chant dirges and threnodies, curse the villains of Karbala (FIGURE 1). Canetti describes the dasta as “an orchestra of grief” (p. 150). [...] When Shi'ite Islam became the state religion in Persia in 907/1501, popular rituals including dasta helped to spread the faith across the Iranian plateau. Foreign residents who spent time in Persia during the 17th and 18th centuries have left very rich accounts of dastas they witnessed, providing a record of the development of this ritual’s pageantry. The majority of popular Shi'ite rituals are conducted in the open, in public spaces, and can be viewed by passers-by. Western visitors to Iran—diplomats, merchants, and missionaries—were fascinated with these rituals and have given us, from the early 17th century onward, quite extensive written accounts of what they saw. [...] A steady increase was observed in the number of participants in the dasta costumed to represent various characters and episodes from the battle at Karbala. Wheeled floats with living tableaux were constructed to pass in front of the multitudes of penitent spectators. A vivid description of the Moḥarram parades was made in 1737 by Thomas Salmons and Matthias Van Goch (pp. 249-53): 'Outstanding in the large public processions are the big theatrically arranged wagons showing scenes of his [Ḥosayn’s, P.Ch.] life and his deeds, his battles, and his death. These wagons are often pulled about accompanied by people, in armor, flags, and emblems of war of victory, depicting some of Hussein’s deeds. For example, a wagon representing the death of Hussein has a deck-like cover coated with sand to represent the arid battlefield. Underneath people are lying thrusting their heads, arms and hands through holes in the cover so they will lie on the sand above to appear as dismembered limbs sprinkled with blood or red paint and colored with a deathly pallor so as to look most natural. Hussein, pallid and bloody, is lying on the other wagon. Several living doves sit on his body, while others are nesting in his blood. After a while, the men under the cover release their bonds, two at a time, so that they can ‘fly to Medina’ to announce Hussein’s death to his sister. Wherever this wagon passes, the people set up such a wailing to show their grief in so many ways and with such conviction, imitation, and naturalistic representations that one wonders at their capacity to give vent to such appropriate signs of suffering so realistically. Their spirit shows through plainly in this impersonation, nor do they spare their bodies: in zeal or desperation, they shed their blood, wound themselves, or are wounded in fights with others; they carry out their intentions with such zeal that it sometimes leads to their own death. It is not possible to tell the difference between feigned dizziness, fainting, and the real thing. One must consider what the stricken people on these tragic wagons endure while presenting their limbs, decapitated heads, hands, and legs in such an uncomfortable position while lying there as if they were dead themselves. [They do this] in all kinds of weather during the processions. Still they suffer rather than move or do something which would disturb that verisimilitude which might be lost.'" <sup id="cite_ref-309" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-309">[309]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> Muharram is one of the months of the Iranian calendar, therefore this ritual only occurred once a year.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> Muharram is one of the months of the Iranian calendar, therefore this ritual only occurred once a year.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> Muharram is one of the months of the Iranian calendar, therefore this ritual only occurred once a year.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 24 ♥</b> hours.

Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Limits_on_Power_of_the_Chief_Executive">Limits on Power of the Chief Executive</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=GbEmpr2&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47" title="Edit section: Limits on Power of the Chief Executive">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div>These codes refer to an explicit or defined right for some group to constrain the activity of the executive in some way, typically through a legal code, but other ways are imaginable (explain in paragraph if other mechanisms found).

It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. So there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used.
