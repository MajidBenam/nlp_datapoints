[...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the sun rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> Relatively detailed contemporary descriptions do not mention audiences, as suggested by Teeter's summary of the ritual <sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "Texts indicated that the priests who assisted in the daily offering service were drawn from the ranks of <i>wabs</i>, lectors, and God's Fathers, all of whom, in some time periods, were part-time priests (see Chapter 2).

[...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the sun rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> Relatively detailed contemporary descriptions do not mention audiences, as suggested by Teeter's summary of the ritual <sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "Texts indicated that the priests who assisted in the daily offering service were drawn from the ranks of <i>wabs</i>, lectors, and God's Fathers, all of whom, in some time periods, were part-time priests (see Chapter 2).

The festival was most popular in the New Kingdom, the Ramesside Period, and Dynasties 25-26, but there are references to the festival as late as 117 BC during the reign of Ptolemy VIII. By that time, however, the festival had likely changed character, taking on more Osirian overtones. [...] "The focus of the festival was the parade of statues portraying the gods and deceased royalty (Plate VIII). [...]  The procession, led by the king, was accompanied by throngs of priests who carried the great fans signifying the presence of the deity and by huge crowds of locals. [...] "Graffiti note that priests watched for the procession from the heights of the west bank. It must have been an exciting and prestigious duty, for some of the priests recorded that they stood lookout for several years in a row. One the flotilla was spotted, mobs of people who lived on the west bank joined the crowd that had followed the procession from the east. Everyone was dressed in his or her finest white linen clothing, clutching flowers and food offerings as they greeted the 'divine arrival' as it moored on the west bank. "[...] People crowded around the pageant clamoring for a view of the gods. One can imagine the roadways and canals of the west bank lined with people laden with bouquets of flowers and baskets of offerings, and crying out in honor of the gods. "[...] "During the first day of the festival, the procession wound its way through the necropolis. The musicians and onlookers made - intentionally - a lot of noise, for according to the texts, those buried in the western necropolis harkened to the sound of the procession. The clamor enlivened them and caused them to emerge from their tombs to see Amun and to meet with their families. "During the festival, priests could participate by carrying the divine boat or walking alongside it, holding the broad fans that announced the divine presence. A much larger number of ordinary people took part as well, by observing the procession and enacting rituals at the family tombs. For them, the most important aspect of the Feast of the Valley was the sensual communion between the living and the dead that took place at the tombs. "[...] The properties of smell, sound, and taste were thought to be capable of transcending the barrier between life and death to reach the deceased and bring him or her into the celebration. These senses were further stimulated by copious amounts of beer and wine, which created an ecstatic state and brought the living closer to he dead. The revelers called on Hathor, addressing her as the 'Lady of Drunkenness.' The families encouraged each other: 'For your <i>ka</i>! Drink the intoxicating drink! Celebrate a beautiful day ... may your heart be refreshed in your house [i.e., tomb].' "The necropolis was filled with activity, noise, smells, and music. Fueled by alcohol and the excitement of the festival, the living recited hymns to their ancestors' statues to encourage the spirits of the deceased to enliven them; 'Emerge from the earth! Behold Ra and follow Amun in his beautiful Feast of the Valley!' The spirits were encouraged to join the procession: 'May you be in the crew of the royal boat and may you hear the clamor in the temples in wester Thebes. May you see Amun in the Beautiful Feast of the Valley and follow him to the temple precincts.' "Bands of musicians circulated through the necropolis visiting individual tombs. Women shook beaded necklaces (<i>menat</i>) and clanged their metallic rattles (sistra) (see Plate III) both instruments sacred to Hathor, while male musicians clapped and sang, creating a hypnotic rhythm that reverberated among the tombs. Their refrains continued into the night[...]" "The odor of food filled the necropolis. The dead were presented with fragrant roasted birds and meat. Sweet myrrh oil was poured on the meats, making the scents even more alluring. [...] "Another source of sensory stimulation was the enormous, fragrant bouquet of flowers, called an <i>ankh</i> (a pun on the word <i>ankh</i> that also means 'life'), that each family presented to its deceased ancestors (Plate X). [...] "All these rituals were enacted to produce an ecstatic union of the dead and the living - to bring the living into the realm of the dead and the dead back to the living." <sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> "The Feast of the Valley was observed once a year, on the first day of the second month of summer in conjunction with the appearance of the new moon." <sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> "The Feast of the Valley was observed once a year, on the first day of the second month of summer in conjunction with the appearance of the new moon." <sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 48 ♥</b> hours.

The pertinent passage reads67: “As for any ruler who will rule in Mo’alla who will act wrongfully and badly against this coffin or against any monument of this tomb, his arm shall be cut off for Hemen68 at his mighty69 procession.”70 The inscription continues with several parallel passages, indicating that the arm is to be cut off during different phases of the processions for Hemen. Willems has argued convincingly that this part of the inscription threatened the ritual sacrifice of future rulers who desecrated Ankhtifi’s mortuary complex.71 He marshals evidence of the tomb inscriptions that demand capital punishment,72 and he shows how the particular tomb fits in with cultic and mythical practices. [...] Overall, Willems has presented a compelling case, and the disagreements have been less than convincing. We must admit that his reading is possible and maybe even likely, given the strong evidence he marshals. Even if we were sure of Willems’s interpretation, it is impossible to generalize anything from the inscription. Ankhtifi ruled and built his tomb in a unique time in Egyptian history, using unique phraseology throughout, after ruling in a unique way.

It is tempting to use a middle figure between these two for this period. Estimated heights for males showed a gradual decline from peak height in the Early Predynastic, through the Old Kingdom down to the Middle Kingdom. For females, the data shows no gradual decline because the Old Kingdom figure is about the same as the Early Predynastic figure of 159.5.<sup id="cite_ref-461" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-461">[461]</a></sup> However the correlation between male and female heights suggests that the First Intermediate Period would not show a rise in heights for females as the male data showed a drop. The question for the female data for this period is when the fall (of nearly 5cm for females) to Middle Kingdom heights would have occurred. Given that the data for the Old Kingdom is for a period 4 times longer than the First Intermediate Period it is reasonable to suppose (especially if bones sampled are primarily from Classic Old Kingdom) there was enough time for a drop to have begun towards the end of this period (in the Late Old Kingdom). Therefore an estimate for the First Intermediate Period that shows a figure midway between the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom figures may be a justified estimate.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prosocial_Behavior">Prosocial Behavior</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgRegns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=77" title="Edit section: Prosocial Behavior">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Volunteering ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Charity ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "The concept of imakhu ['honoured'] (which can also be translated as 'being provided for') was an expression of a remarkable moral dictum that ran through all levels of Egyptian society and that corrected the extreme cases of social inequality: it was the duty of a more influential and richer person to take care of the poor and socially disadvantaged in the same way the head of a family was responsible for all its members."<sup id="cite_ref-462" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-462">[462]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Voluntary Associations</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ voluntary trade associations ♣ inferred absent ♥</b><div> <b>♠ prestige of voluntary trade associations ♣ ♥</b></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ voluntary community organizations ♣ inferred absent ♥</b><div> <b>♠ prestige of voluntary community organizations ♣ ♥</b></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ voluntary athletic clubs ♣ inferred absent ♥</b><div> <b>♠ prestige of voluntary athletic clubs organizations ♣ ♥</b></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other voluntary organizations ♣ inferred absent ♥</b><div> <b>♠ prestige of other voluntary organizations ♣ ♥</b></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ voluntary religious associations ♣ inferred absent ♥</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ prestige of voluntary religious associations ♣ ♥</b></div></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="State_Income">State Income</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgRegns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=79" title="Edit section: State Income">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Tribute ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Staple ♣ ♥</b> Weak central bureaucracy at this time, unlikely to have commanded tribute for the state.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Labor ♣ ♥</b> Weak central bureaucracy at this time, unlikely to have commanded tribute for the state.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Currency ♣ ♥</b> Weak central bureaucracy at this time, unlikely to have commanded tribute for the state.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Debt and Indemnities</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity has obligation to other polity or group ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity receives obligatory payment from other polity or group ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Taxation">Taxation</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=EgRegns&amp;action=edit&amp;section=80" title="Edit section: Taxation">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ ♥</b> Weak central bureaucracy at this time, taxation presumably imposed by the regions and lower than previous period?
