religious activities and a continuation of the strategy of incorporating religious ideas into a visual rhetoric of control spanning media. At Choga Mish a monumental complex is constructed on what is referred to as the High Mound consisting of a polygonal platform, which may have been intended as the foundation for a temple, as well as surrounding buildings and ritual features (Delougaz and Kantor 1996: 27-35). While public architecture on a similar scale at Susa is unknown for this period, fragments of monumental sculpture hint that such structures did exist. Hoards of small-scale sculpture have also been recovered at Susa. Such hoards have parallels at other sites in the Near East, where they were found in temples and other locations of special significance (Pittman 1992: 50). In addition to these architectural remains and artifacts, there are again ceramics, seals, and seal impressions in large quantities with design elements displaying continuity with those seen in previous periods at both Choga Mish and Susa. [...] With so many different human relationships signaled by even more designs and compositions, it is difficult to draw sharp distinctions between secular and ritual motifs; it is helpful to think of the design and the object that displayed it as each having the ability to support multiple parenthetical meanings, depending on their social context. Having said this, however, there are a few representations from seal impressions at both Choga Mish and Susa that appear to highlight ritual actions and figures in particular. Two seal impressions from Choga Mish illustrate a procession of humans and animals to a temple; in both cases, the identification of the building as a temple is based on the presence of gateposts and parallels in design from other sites (Delougaz and Kantor 1996: 145) (see figure 4.4). The first shows two humans—one carrying a staff, the other a mace—flanking a lion standing on its hind legs; all three figures are next to a temple also with a niched facade. The second shows a procession of four human figures—one is next to the temple with a niched façade, and the remaining three are on the other side of the gateposts with one individual carrying a vessel—and two quadrupeds, one of which appears to be a lion. A representation of a temple is also seen on a seal impression from Susa (Pittman 1992). The scene carries a narrative of conflict and also ties the struggle for power with religious institutions: the elaborate temple displays horns that recall the exaggerated wild goat horns previously depicted on ceramics, and the figure to the far left has often been called a “priest-king,” based on his frequent presence in material from Uruk in Mesopotamia. Finally, the master of animals figure seen at Susa at the end of the fifth millennium BCE also makes an appearance on a seal impression at Choga Mish (cf. figure 4.3). Here the figure is now holding two sets of two entwined snakes and lacks the horns springing from his head; the stance is nonetheless clearly resonant. Each of these examples demonstrates that continuity with the imagery of previous periods is sustained, even though the iconography associated with religious practice and belief is becoming more intricately woven into the hierarchies of political and economic activities."
