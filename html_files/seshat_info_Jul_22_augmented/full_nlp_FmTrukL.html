[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_FmTrukL] 'Lying between 7 degrees and 7 minutes and 7 degrees and 14 minutes north latitude and 151 degrees and 22 minutes and 152 degrees and 4 minutes east longitude, Chuuk is a complex atoll: a circle of reefs and about 40 low coral islets enclosing a lagoon of 48 to 64 kilometers in diameter and, within it, 17 high islands of volcanic origin, with a total land area of 86 square kilometers. There are two major seasons, a dry one with northeast trade winds from November to June and a wet one with light winds from the south and southwest.'

In the fourteenth century, a cult center was established on Moen Island. It was abandoned in the eighteenth century following a fresh immigration from neighboring atolls. Japan replaced Germany as the ruling power in World War I and was in turn replaced by the United States under United Nations Trusteeship in 1945. In 1986 Chuuk and its surrounding atolls became a state within the newly independent Federated States of Micronesia. Protestant missionaries and traders came in the 1880s and Roman Catholic missionaries after 1900. Japan sought to develop Chuuk economically and introduced elementary education in Japanese. Education was much expanded under American administration, and many Chuukese learned English. Some went to college in Guam, Hawaii, and the United States mainland. The American administration introduced representative government.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b> The colonial governments appointed a number of head-chiefs and superimposed a colonial administration onto the native system: 'In 1904 the disarming of the Truk people was undertaken by the “Kondor.” There were 436 guns and 2,531 cartridges confiscated. For better control the government appointed six head-chiefs, banished some swashbucklers who did not want to submit, and turned out the Japanese. With this a peaceful development was initiated. The missions (Protestant mission since 1879, Catholic mission since 1912) were able to work undisturbed. Unfortunately, the German government took little notice of Truk, since it was too preoccupied with the other islands. Yet many things were accomplished. Under the last director of the station, A. Überhorst, the lagoon was given new impetus in every respect. The relationship between officials and the population was usually a good one, under Mr. Überhorst even a cordial one. Anyone who was on Truk in those years certainly did not see any bad treatment of the natives. Much was done also with regard to health; in particular Dr. Mayer and his wife traveled from island to island without rest in order to take care of the sick. If during the Japanese occupation a young naval officer was not ashamed to assert that the Germans had done nothing for the islands, anyone who lived on the islands during the Japanese period can only say from the heart: “God protect the poor Truk people under the Japanese.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_FmTrukL] Head-chiefs or island-chiefs resolved disputes that could not be settled on the village level: 'The Germans set up a single chief over each island, or in Truk proper, over each large island with its satellites. One of the functions of this single chief was to settle such land disputes as could not be settled at the village level in order to prevent the outbreak of intra-island warfare.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FmTrukL] In the Japanese period, schooling was introduced, producing a small Chuukese elite of petty officials: 'The purpose of the schools for natives, judging from both reported policies and the Japanese school regulations was to civilize the natives and make them into loyal and economically useful citizens of the Japanese empire. While there was theoretically no limit to the higher education which the native child with sufficient ability and financial support might obtain, in actual fact only a minority of Trukese children attended the fourth and fifth grades, and only a minority of those completing fifth grade obtained further education at the vocational schools. Apparently no Trukese native obtained any academic education beyond fifth grade, except incidentally along with vocational training. The system was geared in effect to produce a supply of general laborers and domestic servants who understood the Japanese language, plus a small elite of skilled laborers and petty officials.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FmTrukL] Fischer also speaks of 'magistrates' and village chiefs, although their relationship to the above categories is somewhat unclear: 'The chiefs who receive these food presentations and feasts may not be the elected magistrates. If the magistrates happen to be also hereditary village chiefs, they receive such presentations, but only from their own village and not from the whole island. Most islands, even the outer islands, have at least two villages, and the larger island of Truk has a dozen or so each. Usually the village chief is a member of the chiefly clan who has been chosen for personal ability and not for seniority. This tendency is by no means universal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_FmTrukL] Expert feedback on this is needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥</b> SCCS variable 84 'Higher Political Organization' is coded 'Absent', not 'Peace group', 'Alliances', 'Confederation', 'International organization'.

Dublon is less than half the size of Moen, but it was selected as the first seat of government because of its superior ship anchorage, particularly for sailing vessels. The American military government relocated the administrative headquarters from Dublon to Moen soon after the formal Japanese surrender in 1945 because of the large amount of unexploded ordnance that remained on Dublon.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Oceanic-Austronesian ♥</b>  There is great linguistic diversity in Micronesia: 'Although it is clear that people first settled Micronesia about 3,500 to 2,000 years ago, archaeological investigations there have been limited by the difficulty of excavating on small densely populated islands whose landscape has often been disturbed by storms. As a result, language rather than archaeology has provided the most insight into the history of early settlement. For example, the languages of eastern and central Micronesia are closely related to Austronesian languages that exist to the southeast in Melanesia. The languages spoken in the west, specifically those of Palau, the Marianas, and Yap, are closely related neither to those in the east nor to one another. These islands on the western edge of Micronesia seem to have been settled from the Philippines and Indonesia. The large number of mutually unintelligible Micronesian languages is a sign of the region’s great cultural diversity. The following islands have mutually unintelligible languages: Nauru, the Gilberts, the Marshalls, Kosrae, Pingelap, Mokil, Pohnpei, Ngatik, the Mortlocks, Chuuk, the Puluwat area, the Woleai area, Yap, Palau, and the Marianas. The languages of the islands from the Marshalls and the Gilberts through the Woleai area in the above list appear to be more closely related to each other than to the remaining languages and have been referred to as “nuclear Micronesian.” The languages of Palau, Yap, and the Marianas are relatively distinct from each other and from other Micronesian languages, although they are clearly Austronesian in their general affiliation. The Chamorro language, spoken in the Marianas, has undergone much influence from Spanish and probably also from the Philippine Tagalog language after more than four centuries of Western contact.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_FmTrukL][MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the colonial period, the colonial governments superimposed a colonial administration onto the native system. They appointed head chiefs to lead each of the main Micronesian islands, but the individual communities remained fragmented.

Colonial Administration[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Head-Chiefs or Island Chiefs and native Petty Officials<div>3. District Chiefs<div>4. Village and Lineage Headmen</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Chuukese/Trukese were divided into multiple clans and lineages: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_FmTrukL] District chiefs were chosen from the dominant lineage of an area: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_FmTrukL] 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_FmTrukL] Traditionally, authority did not extend beyond the atoll and was shared among multiple chiefs on one island. Chuuk was somewhat more fragmented than other Micronesian societies: 'Throughout most of Micronesia the maximum independent autonomous political unit was the high island or the atoll, often subdivided into more than one polity. At the time of European contact, Satawan Atoll in the Mortlocks had four separate communities, each with its own leader, which sometimes fought one another. Palau had two confederations of villages or districts, each independent of the other, and the villages themselves had considerable autonomy. Pohnpei had five petty states, although traditions of a unified rule for the whole island are apparent from an earlier period. Chuuk was extremely fragmented politically, with several independent communities on each of the six larger high islands. The Marshalls and the Gilberts had larger polities and integrated groups of separate atolls under a high chief; these expansionist states achieved their fullest development after the introduction of firearms by Europeans.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_FmTrukL] There was a degree of differentiation between chiefs and ritual specialists: 'No regular religious duties were attached to the chief’s office. They were performed, instead, by various specialists. A chief was concerned, however, that the proper specialists [Page 144] engage in their respective activities at appropriate times, at least when the welfare of the entire district was involved. He also used to set the times for dances, which were a popular form of entertainment before the missionaries banned them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_FmTrukL] The colonial governments appointed a number of head-chiefs and superimposed a colonial administration onto the native system: 'In 1904 the disarming of the Truk people was undertaken by the “Kondor.” There were 436 guns and 2,531 cartridges confiscated. For better control the government appointed six head-chiefs, banished some swashbucklers who did not want to submit, and turned out the Japanese. With this a peaceful development was initiated. The missions (Protestant mission since 1879, Catholic mission since 1912) were able to work undisturbed. Unfortunately, the German government took little notice of Truk, since it was too preoccupied with the other islands. Yet many things were accomplished. Under the last director of the station, A. Überhorst, the lagoon was given new impetus in every respect. The relationship between officials and the population was usually a good one, under Mr. Überhorst even a cordial one. Anyone who was on Truk in those years certainly did not see any bad treatment of the natives. Much was done also with regard to health; in particular Dr. Mayer and his wife traveled from island to island without rest in order to take care of the sick. If during the Japanese occupation a young naval officer was not ashamed to assert that the Germans had done nothing for the islands, anyone who lived on the islands during the Japanese period can only say from the heart: “God protect the poor Truk people under the Japanese.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_FmTrukL] 'On the main islands the German government introduced head chiefs (somol lap) who carried the flag. There were six of them, one each on Poloas, Uman, Fefan, Wöla, Udot, and Pol /Pul/. The smaller islands likewise belonged to the sphere of power of the head chiefs. But even this institution could not link the tribes together within themselves or with one another. Some of the lower chiefs sympathize with the head chief for egotistical reasons; others fight against him violently for the same reasons. One who is with him today might be against him tomorrow because he somehow stepped on his toes. It is often enough for the subchief to fight the head chief if his neighboring chief supports him. Thus the picture is constantly changing. [Page 125] There is a continuous, sometimes quiet, sometimes open, warfare of the subchiefs against the head chiefs, the lower chiefs among themselves, the common people against the chiefs. The main reason for this disagreeable phenomenon is the limitless egotism of the Truk people. Everyone strives more or less to be something of a chief also. Strong families who do not like the chief attempt to isolate themselves and choose one from their midst. In addition to this, there are also old family enmities and disputes about land. It is obvious that the islands will never be able to achieve peaceful development in this manner. It is difficult to say who is most to blame for it. In any case the chiefs are not to be pitied, because they behave themselves accordingly. They are to be blamed mostly for the exploitation of the people, their corruptibility, and partiality. Many of them unhesitatingly accept money and objects and help the giver, no matter how many times he is in the wrong.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_FmTrukL] Head-chiefs or island-chiefs resolved disputes that could not be settled on the village level: 'The Germans set up a single chief over each island, or in Truk proper, over each large island with its satellites. One of the functions of this single chief was to settle such land disputes as could not be settled at the village level in order to prevent the outbreak of intra-island warfare.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_FmTrukL] The colonial administration established itself on Toloas: 'The main island is Toloas. On it lie: the government station (Witetun), the main station of the Catholic ( O[unknown]omenau) and of the Protestant ( Kutua) missions. The landmark of Poloas is the legendary mountain of Tolemuan (peak of the man). The small island of Eten, on which was to be found the seat of the Jaluit Company, is also under the head chief of Toloas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_FmTrukL] 'The Japanese, like the Germans, divided the Carolines into administrative districts governed from centers located on some of the more populous high islands. Under the Japanese, Truk—more specifically Dublon or Tolowas Island—was established as an administrative center. (Previously, under the Spanish and Germans Truk had been governed, rather nominally, from Ponape, 380 miles to the east).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_FmTrukL] In the Japanese period, schooling was introduced, producing a small Chuukese elite of petty officials: 'The purpose of the schools for natives, judging from both reported policies and the Japanese school regulations was to civilize the natives and make them into loyal and economically useful citizens of the Japanese empire. While there was theoretically no limit to the higher education which the native child with sufficient ability and financial support might obtain, in actual fact only a minority of Trukese children attended the fourth and fifth grades, and only a minority of those completing fifth grade obtained further education at the vocational schools. Apparently no Trukese native obtained any academic education beyond fifth grade, except incidentally along with vocational training. The system was geared in effect to produce a supply of general laborers and domestic servants who understood the Japanese language, plus a small elite of skilled laborers and petty officials.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_FmTrukL] Fischer also speaks of 'magistrates' and village chiefs, although their relationship to the above categories is somewhat unclear: 'The chiefs who receive these food presentations and feasts may not be the elected magistrates. If the magistrates happen to be also hereditary village chiefs, they receive such presentations, but only from their own village and not from the whole island. Most islands, even the outer islands, have at least two villages, and the larger island of Truk has a dozen or so each. Usually the village chief is a member of the chiefly clan who has been chosen for personal ability and not for seniority. This tendency is by no means universal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_FmTrukL] Expert feedback on this is needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥</b> levels.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Mediums, Diviners, and Healers as well as other Ritual Specialists[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Ritual practices were conducted by their own specialists. They included spirit mediums, breadfruit summoners, fish summoners, healers, masters of spells, masters of sorcery, builders, navigators, diviners, and most importantly the masters of magic and ritual relating to war and politics. Their knowledge was private property passed down to their children and junior lineage mates.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_FmTrukL] 'Major ceremonies were those associated with death, communicating with good souls of the dead, summoning breadfruit, and making food presentations to chiefs. Ritual was also associated with divination, curing, warfare, political meetings, house building, and courtship.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_FmTrukL] Mediums communicated with the dead: 'In traditional belief, spirit beings were widely distributed in the sky, under the sea, and on land. The important places among spirit lands in the sky were: a region under the dome of Heaven, home of the gods who could take human form; a region in the south from which came all the plant and marine life that gave people food; and a region named 'Achaw' or 'Kachaw,' abode of the ancestors of many Chuukese clans and particularly of the clans associated with the chiefship and the special bodies of magical lore from which chiefly power derived. Spirits could accomplish their intentions at will and were thus the source of all that was MANAMAN (mana), such as efficacious spells, medicines, and rituals. Good souls of the dead were consulted through mediums. The Chuukese also invoked in spells the spirits inhabiting the dome of Heaven, presided over by 'Great Spirit,' and the spirits associated with particular crafts and major bodies of lore.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_FmTrukL] Diviners, Healers, and Mediums were involved in the treatment of illness: 'Sickness was believed to result from the 'bite' of a malevolent spirit, or of any other spirit one had offended or that was controlled by a ritual specialist one had offended or by a sorcerer. Sickness might also result from soul loss. In all but the latter case, treatment involved the use of medicines to be applied externally, to be drunk, or to be inhaled. For soul loss, a spirit medium was consulted to help find and restore the soul. Divination was used as a diagnostic aid in cases of severe or prolonged illness. Massage was used to treat bruises, local infections, and muscle ailments.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_49_FmTrukL] Diviners accepted payments from apprentices in exchange for secret knowledge: 'There are systems of knowledge which are subject to special rules of their own. [Page 56] For example, to learn knot divination a pupil must pay the diviner ( sowupwe) even if the latter is his own father or mother’s brother. An jitag (a sort of lawyer, general, diplomat and orator all rolled into one, who occupies the most prestigeful position in Trukese society) is alleged never to teach his own children as much as he teaches his sister’s children. This contention does not, however, appear to be supported by the genealogical connections of the past jitag of Romonum Island. Despite special rules governing specific forms of incorporeal property, their over-all organization is analogous to that of corporeal property and does not require a new conceptual framework to make them intelligible.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_50_FmTrukL] Spirit mediums were an exception to this rule, as their expertise did not rely on knowledge per se: 'All religious practitioners as well as craftsmen and magicians are owners of the knowledge necessary to exercise their specialties. The Trukese make no distinction between them and other skilled personnel. There is one important exception to this rule, the spirit medium ( wäättwa or wään ëny). His (or her) position is not based on knowledge so much as on having been possessed by a spirit. This spirit is in no way classed as the medium’s property, nor can it be inherited automatically by a son or lineage mate. The position of a spirit medium, therefore, is different from that of a property holder, except as he uses his abilities to diagnose illness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_51_FmTrukL] As a result of missionary activities, Christianity spread quickly in the 20th century: 'After 1900 Christianity became well established in most major centres in Micronesia. For the most part, traditional religions ceased being practiced in their full original form, although in Yap and some atolls of the central Carolines, traditional religion continued to be practiced until the middle of the 20th century. Missionaries and travelers recorded descriptions of certain aspects of the island religions, but there is no complete and systematic account.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_52_FmTrukL] 'The main island is Toloas. On it lie: the government station (Witetun), the main station of the Catholic ( O[unknown]omenau) and of the Protestant ( Kutua) missions. The landmark of Poloas is the legendary mountain of Tolemuan (peak of the man). The small island of Eten, on which was to be found the seat of the Jaluit Company, is also under the head chief of Toloas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_53_FmTrukL] 'Before the Spanish Government had gained sufficient influence in the islands, the people of Truk lived under the rule of numerous petty chiefs who were constantly engaging in inter-district and inter-island warfare. In Spanish and German times, Catholic and Protestant missionaries Christianized and subdued the warlike tendencies of the population, but many of the old suspicious attitudes still show in present-day culture patterns. The numbers of Spanish and Germans who came to Truk at any one time were relatively small; they left their mark on the people in the folklore, in the religion and in the alphabet which they applied to the Trukese language, teaching the people to read and write. It was left to the Japanese to make the most impression on the native economy.'

Groups of Armed Men or Citizen-Soldiers</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>There were no troops or police forces&nbsp;: 'There were no police. A chief's brothers or sons might act on his behalf to intimidate or attack someone who had offended him. But it was control of magical power, either by the chief or one his brothers or sons, that made improper conduct liable to punishment. Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery. All such knowledge gave punitive power to chiefs and important specialists. People stressed maintaining the appearance of propriety in behavior so as not to give just cause for offense.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_55_FmTrukL] Prior to 'pacification', violent conflict played out in raids and battles between rival groups of armed men: 'Within districts, conflict arose over land, succession to chiefship, theft, adultery, and avenging homicide. Between districts, it arose over attentions to local women by outside men, the status of one district as subordinate to another, and rights of access to fishing areas. Formal procedures for terminating conflict between districts involved payments of valuables and land by the loosing to the winning side. Fighting involved surprise raids and prearranged meetings on a field of battle. Principle weapons were slings, spears, and clubs. Firearms, introduced late in the nineteenth century, were confiscated by German authorities in 1903. Martial arts included an elaborate system of throws and holds by which an unarmed man could kill, maim or disarm an armed opponent.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_56_FmTrukL] Competition between rival chiefs over the control of land and people was a major factor: 'Traditional Micronesian life was characterized by a belief in the stability of society and culture. People suffered occasional natural disasters, such as cyclones or droughts, but their goal after encountering one of these was to reconstitute the previous state of affairs. Wars occurred in most areas from time to time, mainly at the instigation of competing chiefs. At stake was the control of land—a limited resource—and followers, but there were usually few casualties. Living in small communities on small territories, Micronesians learned to adjust to their neighbours, to remain on good terms with most of them most of the time, and to develop techniques of reconciliation when fights did break out. Micronesians traditionally depended on the cultivation of plant crops and on fishing in shallow reef waters. Because arable land was in short supply for the relatively dense population, Micronesians had a strong practical basis for their attachment to locality and lands. Land rights were usually held through lineages or extended family groups, often backed up by traditions of ancestral origins on the land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_FmTrukL] Conflict among chiefs and their followers did not terminate entirely with 'pacification', although the population was disarmed in the early 20th century: 'In 1904 the disarming of the Truk people was undertaken by the “Kondor.” There were 436 guns and 2,531 cartridges confiscated.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_FmTrukL] The colonial governments stationed troops on the island, but it appears that natives were not recruited into the Japanese military: 'Despite the large immigration of Okinawan fishermen under the Japanese, all of whom have been repatriated, and despite the presence of 35,000 troops and laborers during the war, the native social structure remains fundamentally unchanged from aboriginal times. This is probably due in no small part to the fact that Truk has been spared the ravages of depopulation. It has also been helped by the Japanese prohibition, continued by the United States, against purchase of land from natives by foreigners. Aside from the small area on which the administrative garrison is presently housed, the Trukese continue to use all the lands which they traditionally exploited. Every native community that existed in 1900 appears still to be intact. Despite the discontinuance of warfare, an almost complete conversion to Christianity, a high proportion of literacy, and considerable modification in technology, Trukese society is still a vigorously going concern, its pattern of organization little changed by the events of the past 50 years.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_FmTrukL] 'During World War II, many Micronesian islands were heavily contested; major military engagements took place between Japanese and American forces in Palau, Guam, the northern Marianas, Chuuk (then known as Truk), the Marshalls, and parts of the Gilberts. The war inflicted great suffering and left the regional economy in shambles. Infrastructure and property had been destroyed, food shortages were widespread, and many people had been displaced. As recently as the early 21st century, reminders of the war remained omnipresent. Chuuk’s lagoon, for instance, holds an entire Japanese fleet that sank in 1944. Complete with human skeletons, dishes, and even fighter planes and tanks that had been tied on deck, the fleet has been declared an underwater museum and has become a popular tourist destination.'

In practice the bu[unknown] is usually illusory, since nobody wants to follow it. Not for nothing do the Truk people say sarcastically about the conditions on their islands: “ en sob me bu[unknown]un, each district has its own laws,” or what is even worse: “ en me bu[unknown]un,” freely translated: “So many heads, so many meanings.” Moreover, it is a duty of the chief to communicate to the people the regulations of the government, to see that they are carried out, and to collect the head tax.'

The grantee need not now render first fruits or obtain the grantor’s approval for transactions he wished to arrange. The head of the granting corporation could no longer claim to be sowuppwún; this title now belonged to the head of the recipient corporation if he wished to claim it. Some people on Romónum continue to follow traditional practice and continue to render gifts of first fruits to the traditional sowuppwún as a matter of courtesy, and there are some who still try to assert their right to first fruits under the traditional system.

All local governmental functions are carried on in the district wuut.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_FmTrukL] Goodenough also mentions dwelling-houses as distinct from meeting-houses: 'In aboriginal times there used to be associated with most lineages a dwelling house, jimw. This house varied in size depending on the number of its inhabitants. Since married men normally went to live in the jimw of their wives’ lineages, the occupants of an jimw were the women of a lineage and their husbands. The only males of the lineage who resided there were boys below puberty. A large jimw was usually partitioned off into sleeping compartments along its side walls under the eaves, one for each married woman and her husband with their small children, and a separate one for the unmarried girls past puberty. The house had a sand floor spread over with coconut fronds. Its occupants slept and sat on mats plaited from pandanus leaves. The central part of the house formed a sort of living room in which minor cooking was done over an open fire, ordinary meals were taken, and where the members of the household whiled away the time before going to bed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_79_FmTrukL] There were also smaller dwellings for individual families: 'Not all houses were of this type, for some were much smaller, without partitions, and were occupied by only one or two couples. Such houses were used when a lineage had only a few women, or when a man brought his wife to live on his own land instead of going to live in her lineage household. In the latter case it was customary to build a separate house for the man and wife, since it is normally taboo for a man to sleep in the same house with his sisters. A small house might also be built alongside the main one if the latter became too crowded.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_80_FmTrukL] Smaller dwellings became the norm in the colonial period: 'The old, large lineage house is in little use today. The Trukese now live in smaller houses of the old type or in new-style houses, raised on posts and built of planks with corrugated iron roofs. These smaller houses are still occupied by the women of a lineage, either singly or in pairs, and are clustered together either by lineage or by descent line.

These served as social gathering places and as places to plan community affairs. The number and elaborateness of the meetinghouses were greatest in Palau and Yap. In Palau, Yap, and the western atolls, meetinghouses were used mostly by men, while farther east, women and children also entered them freely much of the time. Canoe houses were another important form of building throughout Micronesia. Those big enough to store the larger canoes were on the scale of meetinghouses and often were used as such in some areas. Small buildings for the isolation of menstruating women were common in the western Carolines, and they continued to be used in Yap until well into the 20th century.' The following paragraph seems to indicate that blow shells were sounded from chiefly dwellings in order to assemble the villagers: 'As a reward for his faithful activity, the chief receives the muen, that is, the first fruits from the yields of the fields and trees, for example, breadfruit, bananas, and taro. It is said that many chiefs go to the fields in order to inspect their condition so that if the occasion arises they can check the deliveries. The Truk chiefs do not have any other legal claims. Nevertheless their subjects give them assistance in their own interests. The chief usually receives the best part from festive meals and fishing. If there is fishing with mention of the name of the chief, however, he receives everything, and nobody is allowed to withhold anything. Woe to the one who in former times did not pay his tribute properly. He had no prospect of a long life. It is said of the old chiefs that they always had the blow shell beside them. When the puk, puk of the shell resounded from the chief’s house, the people knew its meaning immediately. They quickly came running in order to /117/ learn the wishes of the tyrant. At one time he would desire kon (pounded breadfruit), at another time fish, then [Page 128] bananas, then coconuts to drink. The chiefs today no longer dare commit these outrages but they still have sufficient means to obtain some things on the side. They announce a dance, for example, or hold an efilul (celebration in connection with house-building, held when the frame is erected). They certainly do not come out short at the feast connected with this. As a matter of fact, most chiefs understand very well how to entice from their people whatever they might like to have.'

In addition, some of the more adventurous boys in the higher elementary school cherished the hope of getting to visit distant places by their school work.

At the present time a converted gasoline drum, with the lid removed by cutting with a cold chisel, is placed just outside the house to catch rainwater from the corrugated iron roof; or else water is carried from springs and kept in glass bottles. In former times, fresh water springs located on high ground inland constituted the chief source of supply and water was carried from these springs in coconut shell containers. In former times also, short breadfruit logs were occasionally dubbed out and placed beneath the eaves to catch rainwater.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_FmTrukL] The supply pipes that Goodenough describes in the following paragraph seem to have been the exception rather than the rule: 'Anything that has acquired a productive or practical value as the result of human labor is owned as property, whereas ownership is less likely with things directly consumable from nature. Thus there are fishing rights in water areas, but water itself is the property of no one, especially fresh water. The main source of drinking water on Romonum is a spring in the center of the island. The land on which it is located is owned, but the spring itself is free to all, and in the old days before the introduction of rain barrels was used by everyone on the island. When the native storekeeper recently ran a pipe from this spring to his house some distance away, he incurred no obligations toward the people owning the land from which the water is piped. Similarly, medicinal herbs, dried coconut fronds for kindling, wild cooking herbs, and leaves for wrapping food bundles may be freely gathered by anyone, anywhere, without first speaking to the owner of the land on which they are found.'

Baseball became quite popular in Truk in Japanese times and English baseball terms are still pronounced in a Trukese modification of a Japanese accent by the men who attended Japanese schools.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_FmTrukL] 'The fact of daily association and residential proximity puts the members of a community in a position where they are most likely to call upon one another rather than strangers for assistance in the many little tasks that come up where an extra hand or two may be needed, as, for example, in launching a canoe. The members of a community tend, therefore, to be more or less obligated ( kinessëw) to one another in informal matters as well as in more formal property relationships. Similarly, recreational activities frequently involve the entire community membership. Dancing appears to have been [Page 147] the most important activities of this kind in aboriginal times, but under the influence of missionaries it has come to be considered sinful and no longer serves this purpose. Its place has been taken by baseball, a sport introduced by the Japanese. When services are over, every Sunday on Romonum is devoted to baseball in which the entire population participates as players or spectators.

In 1986 Chuuk and its surrounding atolls became a state within the newly independent Federated States of Micronesia. Protestant missionaries and traders came in the 1880s and Roman Catholic missionaries after 1900. Japan sought to develop Chuuk economically and introduced elementary education in Japanese.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_89_FmTrukL] 'The Japanese administration followed a policy of starting their educational and other socio-economic programs for the natives at the district centers and spreading outwards. The government school system for natives was initiated by establishing a three-year elementary school near the district administrative center on Dublon Island. This school was staffed by Japanese male teachers with Trukese assistants. The latter at first served as interpreters and helped with the discipline. Students were selected on a quota basis from the various islands of the lagoon. Apparently only boys were selected at first, although girls were soon added.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_90_FmTrukL] 'Eventually other three-year elementary schools were established on the other large islands of the lagoon and on one of the Mortlock Islands, a group of atolls to the south of Truk, while a higher elementary school of two additional grades was established at the district center on Dublon Island for selected graduates of the lower schools. Lower school attendance was then made compulsory within Truk Lagoon.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_91_FmTrukL] Some trade schools were also established: 'A further step on the educational ladder was eventually provided with the establishment of a trade school for carpenters at Koror, Palau, a thousand miles to the west. Promising graduates of the higher elementary schools were selected from all over the mandated territory to attend this school. Later a small agricultural school was established on Dublon Island, Truk, and, after the Japanese started to alienate “undeveloped” native land for colonization, a surveyor’s school was established in Palau.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_92_FmTrukL] Fischer provides a description of Japanese schools: 'The physical plant of the government schools consisted of the school building itself (classrooms and storerooms), and quarters nearby for the teacher or teachers. The school buildings were designed and built by the Japanese government, although native contributions of building sites and labor were evidently sometimes encouraged. The school buildings were of substantial construction; more substantial, one might argue, than was needed in the mild climate of Truk.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_93_FmTrukL] Secondary and tertiary education become more widespread under American rule: 'Education was much expanded under American administration, and many Chuukese learned English. Some went to college in Guam, Hawaii, and the United States mainland. The American administration introduced representative government.'

He says that three other men were trying to marry her but she consistently rejected them. Of Paul, however, she approved. He approached her family but found her father’s “brother,” with whom she was living at the time, opposed. Thwarted, Paul went to four Japanese who were living on the island supervising road work; Paul had already told them of his intention of marrying Susan. They offered to help and the next day told her father’s “brother” that if he did not permit the marriage he would get all the dirty jobs from then on. He was, however, adamant and Paul had to give it up. Having had intercourse twice in one night during the negotiations “because we did not know how it would work out later” this time they had intercourse three times and he left.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_95_FmTrukL] Bollig also refers to road construction undertaken by colonial authorities: 'The number of the Truk people, taken together, will not exceed 12,000. They live together for the most part in small villages on the seashore. Isolated families also live scattered in the mountains on their plantings. Thanks to the German government, there are good roads around the island.

It is almost as if they had no feeling at all for any order and cleanliness. Around the house filth, rags, food remains; in it, the same. To be sure, they have a word for broom ( böbö), but rarely use it. They also bathe, even several times a day, and yet are never clean. If a tree falls across the path, it remains there. Everybody who takes the path has to climb over it. If a bridge collapses, it remains for months and years, until it is replaced.

Islanders traditionally used canoes for sea travel: 'All Micronesians relied heavily on water travel, although the high islanders used canoes principally in the sheltered coastal waters of their home islands. Micronesian canoes had a single hull with one outrigger. Canoes used in protected waters were often simple dugouts, but the oceangoing vessels, found especially in the central Carolinian atolls, the Marshalls, and the Gilberts, had sides built up of irregular planks that were caulked and sewn together with cord made from coconut-husk fibre.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_FmTrukL] Ports were established in the colonial period: 'The high islands of the Chuuk group have mangrove swamps along their coasts, as well as rainforests in the central mountainous areas. The native people are Micronesians who fish, raise pigs and poultry, and grow taro, breadfruit, yams, and bananas. Copra is the chief cash crop. The islands are popular with scuba divers, who come to explore the lagoon’s shipwrecks, many of which have become foundations for new reef growth. The largest urban area is on Weno; the rest of the population resides mostly in traditional villages scattered around the islands. Chuuk has a commercial dock and an international airport, both located on Weno. Total land area 49.1 square miles (127.2 square km). Pop. (2010) 48,654.'

When a man’s lineage is without a meeting house, he attends that of his father’s or his wife’s lineage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_101_FmTrukL] 'Under aboriginal conditions a lineage’s wuut was not necessarily located near its jimw. It frequently stood by the shore, where it served as a canoe house ( wutten waa) as well as a meeting house ( wutten mwiic). A meeting house was not in itself taboo to women, although normally they did not enter it if men other than their husbands were present. Both men and women, however, could be present together at such feasts and dances as did not exclude one sex and were held in the meeting house. During certain ceremonies, men kept away from the meeting house and it was used exclusively by women. The women of a lineage could hold meetings of their own in its wuut.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_102_FmTrukL] 'Its wuut was the place where the unmarried young men of a lineage slept. Its older men, and at times the husbands of its women, also slept there whenever they were observing important sexual taboos. A meeting house was the lounging place for men during the evening, where they visited and told stories. In it visitors from other islands and districts were received, entertained, and put up for the night.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_103_FmTrukL] 'All the old lineage meeting houses of Romonum are gone today. All over Truk, however, every district still maintains at least one meeting house. Women enter them more freely now than they used to, because the unmarried men no longer sleep there. The latter now go to sleep in the houses of non-taboo relatives. Several unmarried men may together occupy a small hut for sleeping purposes, the hut being built in the style of an jimw rather than of an wuut. The district meeting house is still the place where the men sleep before a ball game or track meet. Guests are still entertained there, and it still is the place for feasts and district meetings.

Burial might be in the ground or in a mat bundle at sea (since Christianity, in a wooden coffin). After burial, the grave was watched by close kin for four nights to see if the good soul would possess one of them as its future medium. On the fourth day after burial, the deceased's immediate effects were burned and the good soul ascended to Heaven in the smoke. Everyone had two souls, a 'good' and a 'bad.' The good soul came from the sky world and returned there after death. The bad soul became a ghost that might be dangerous and cause illness. By the middle of the twentieth century all of Chuuk's people were at least nominally Christian, either Protestant or Catholic, and Christianity had become the focus of religious life.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_105_FmTrukL] 'Several people drifted back in the neighborhood of the grave, and the nephew of the deceased brought a small wooden cross which he and Andy pounded in at the head of the grave. A little shelf was later erected in front of this and the cross and shelf were decorated with flowers which were renewed periodically, in the days that followed, by Kitty. Kitty brought a small kerosene lamp which was placed by the cross in a wooden box which later received a corrugated iron cover to keep the rain out. She then began bringing sand in a bowl, assisted by two young men of the lineage; this was spread evenly over the top of the grave to give it a neat appearance.'

Baseball became quite popular in Truk in Japanese times and English baseball terms are still pronounced in a Trukese modification of a Japanese accent by the men who attended Japanese schools.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_107_FmTrukL] 'The fact of daily association and residential proximity puts the members of a community in a position where they are most likely to call upon one another rather than strangers for assistance in the many little tasks that come up where an extra hand or two may be needed, as, for example, in launching a canoe. The members of a community tend, therefore, to be more or less obligated ( kinessëw) to one another in informal matters as well as in more formal property relationships. Similarly, recreational activities frequently involve the entire community membership. Dancing appears to have been [Page 147] the most important activities of this kind in aboriginal times, but under the influence of missionaries it has come to be considered sinful and no longer serves this purpose. Its place has been taken by baseball, a sport introduced by the Japanese. When services are over, every Sunday on Romonum is devoted to baseball in which the entire population participates as players or spectators. Many communities are now split into Catholic and Protestant congregations, but the indications are that in former times participation in religious ceremonies was largely a community affair.'

At intervals someone came in to measure the corpse, first with a fish-spear and later a folding rule. They leaned and even stepped over the corpse without any sign of concern. Five other men, mostly in the lineage, took turns digging the grave; their burial plot was only about a hundred feet from the house on the slope of a hill. This facilitated checking the size of the grave against the coffin and kept all the preparations more unified than is usual if the burial plot is farther removed. Each of these two groups of men was headed by husbands of the dead woman’s daughters. Both projects were finished by noon. The coffin was brought in the house and placed by the body. At this time Kitty’s mother-in-law relieved her in fanning the body, the first such relief she had had; she got up and shortly thereafter put on an ordinary dress. It was urged by various of the men then and a little later that the burial take place at once lest the body turn black; Kitty refused and her word was final in keeping with her status as the oldest daughter.

Similarly the word wik is of English origin (week) = Woche /“week” in German/.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_116_FmTrukL] 'The year of the Truk people is a lunar year and has 12 months ( maram). Some old pölu also say 13. But the 13th one is then only a substitute month for another one which is left out, so that in practice there are always only 12.

This regard for the night is easy to understand if one [Page 227] considers the tropical heat during the day. There is also the fact that one cannot be observed so easily at night. Therefore the Truk people do many important things at night. If the night is dark, dry coconut fronds are taken along as torches to be lighted if necessary. The greatest rejoicing prevails when the moon rises and casts its gentle light over the islands. It is the samolun lepuin, the chief of the night.

On the Truk Islands there were two large war parties, which usually stayed together except for minor internal quarrels. These war parties were called mateulap, large spear, and mateutun, small spear. The mateulap included the kin group of the Sapulupi with all the related kin groups. Mateutun included the kin group of the Soufar with the affiliated kin groups.

These two mateu were continually contesting as to which of them was the more important. Numerically mateulap was considerably superior to the mateutun.

Indeed, in the translations of native texts, they regularly render Kachaw as Kosrae or Kusaie. In his accounts of Carolinian navigators’ lore, Riesenberg (1972) does the same thing when the name Kachaw (Achaw, Araw) appears in the mnenomic exercises he recorded (see also Damm and Sarfert 1935:102-103).

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_FmTrukL] Islanders performed poetry and storytelling: 'Performing arts included dancing, storytelling, playing the noseflute and bamboo Jew's harp (in courtship serenading), singing, and poetry and rhetoric. Other arts were associated with tattooing, woodworking, weaving, and warfare.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_FmTrukL] These may have been rather fluid as well.

Kachaw also appears as a place in Carolinian navigational lore. Until very recently, at least, most Micronesian scholars have accepted as fact that Kachaw is the island of Kosrae (Kusaie), situated about 560 km east southeast of Ponape. This identification has led to historical inferences about the role of Kosrae in Ponapean and Trukese prehistory. Critical examination of the linguistic and contextual evidence, however, indicates that in traditional Micronesian lore Kachaw referred to something quite different, namely the sky or a region of sky. It is as such that Kachaw was important in Trukese and Ponapean cosmology, religion, and legends of origin.

Instead of saying, “I am 10 years old,” the Truk native says, “ e[unknown]ol ai räs” or “e[unknown]ol ai äfän,” that is, “I am 10 räs” or “I am 10 äfän old.” They also indeed have a name for year, namely, ir, the English /207/ word year. Similarly the word wik is of English origin (week) = Woche /“week” in German/.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_135_FmTrukL] 'The year of the Truk people is a lunar year and has 12 months ( maram). Some old pölu also say 13. But the 13th one is then only a substitute month for another one which is left out, so that in practice there are always only 12. The months are reckoned from the first quarter to the next first quarter. They regard as lying in between 30 moonlight nights ( puinin maram), the names of which are taken from the phases of the moon. The names of the months themselves are star names.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_137_FmTrukL] 'Another factor apparently of psychological importance in some case of isolation of Causcasians is the time dimension. For some reason, many people appear to cling with desperation to some ingeniously contrived means of estimating the time of day and the date, a last contact with reality or basis for hope which, when lost, marks their real breakdown. For the Trukese this is a matter of little or no concern. Aboriginally they were equipped to reckon the seasons, and to divide the day into morning, daytime, afternoon, evening, and night, but these were means for relating oneself to the realities of nature, not an arbitrary system for bounding one’s activities. In response to the demands of foreigners they have learned to tėll time and the date, but when not [Page 898] in a foreign context they pay little attention to either. A man who has acquired a watch and wears it as a sign of status is concerned if it does not run, but may not even bother to set it if he discovers it is an hour or two off. We may therefore conclude that losing track of the time, which so dismays Western castaways, matters little or not at all to the Trukese.'

Islanders traditionally engaged in trading expeditions and barter trade: 'At the present time, sailing canoes suitable for long trips remain in use only in the small islands of the Caroline group scattered widely over the ocean from Truk westward. The language and culture found on these islands relate them clearly to Truk, whereas most of them fell historically under the hegemony of Yap to the west—a tie which Lessa (1956) has demonstrated is by no means completely extinct. Both Truk and Yap possess volcanic soils which can support crops impossible of cultivation on the sandy coral islets which lie between. Trade therefore provided the impetus for travel to and from the high islands, and there was in addition considerable social visiting back and forth between all the islands. Some voyages, apparently of exploration, have also been recorded extending over hundreds of miles to Guam and even remoter islands. Trips of up to 200 miles or so are still made, although with reduced frequency. Canoes are also used on a few islands other than those mentioned above for interisland, but essentially local, travel to Truk and Ponape.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_141_FmTrukL] 'The acquisition of property on Truk is usually done by means of barter. Lands, houses, and canoes are bartered. Smaller units of exchange are sebi (wooden bowls), deig (curcuma), faupar (red shell disks), hip mats, modesty bands, fishing nets, aromatic oils, coconut cord, home-grown tobacco, and sleeping mats. These products of native industry are not present in like quantity or in like quality on all the islands. Thus, Sapesis on Fefan is famous for its fine bowls, Pol for curcuma and oils, Iluk for its fine hip mats.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_142_FmTrukL] 'Weaving generally takes place at certain times, especially when the canoes from the low islands are expected, the inhabitants of which barter for things. In former times not very nice [Page 186] customs were associated with weaving. When the women had completed their work, they put on the new mats and gathered on the shore.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_143_FmTrukL] Money was introduced by the colonial administration, but barter continued into the colonial period: 'As a result of the German, Japanese, and American administrations, the natives have become thoroughly aware of the value of money in relation to specific situations. It is needed to pay taxes and is required for the purchase of goods from local retail outlets. Money is in fairly wide use in native transactions, though barter continues as the more practical form of exchange. Two informants, for example, had no trouble in estimating the cash price of a coconut tree (if not old) at $2.00 and that of a breadfruit tree at $5.00, a big one fetching perhaps as much as $10.00. Sales of trees are, however, fairly rare. If they should become more common, one might predict that the price would rise to accord with their economic importance. As the present prices suggest, money plays no part in the domestic food economy. It is needed to purchase food by only a handful of natives. Except for them, money is treated simply as an important sort of movable property ( pisek). One may make a niffag of money, trade it for goods or for labor, and have it appropriated by one’s wife’s brothers as a kiis.'

One morning I heard a young man shouting at his wife that she had lost the key to the locked box she shared with him. (Everyone has a box that can be locked, in which prayer books, money, or other valuables are kept.) As I approached the house, the woman rushed out carrying her infant daughter and followed by her husband, who was brandishing a machete. He shouted “You are very disobedient,” and struck her across the chest with the flat of the machete. The woman staggered back and began to wail that the baby had been cut. Her brother, who was with me, ran to her and began shaking her. “See the price of your disobedience!” he told her. The brother explained afterward that his sister was not virtuous ( mirit) and that she “drove everyone crazy.” The woman’s brothers must also protect a man’s marital rights with their sister if the husband fulfills his obligations to them.'

Anyone can go to them at night without being punished, since, indeed, his wife too is abandoned.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_149_FmTrukL] 'The chief does all these duties in the kobu[unknown], the public meeting. Men as well as women are invited to this kobu[unknown]. All the participants are called together by the blowing of the large shell from the chief’s house. The kobu[unknown] takes place in the udd, the large men’s house. All the dealings of the tribe are discussed in it, marital matters, land matters, quarrels, in short, all the linen, whether clean or dirty, is spread out before all eyes. Everybody is allowed to talk and present his complaints. Of course there is no lack of amusing scenes too. Sometimes the people become so excited that the parties insult each other, grab each other, and come to blows, so that the meeting has to be dissolved.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_150_FmTrukL] 'It is said of the old chiefs that they always had the blow shell beside them. When the puk, puk of the shell resounded from the chief’s house, the people knew its meaning immediately. They quickly came running in order to /117/ learn the wishes of the tyrant. At one time he would desire kon (pounded breadfruit), at another time fish, then [Page 128] bananas, then coconuts to drink. The chiefs today no longer dare commit these outrages but they still have sufficient means to obtain some things on the side. They announce a dance, for example, or hold an efilul (celebration in connection with house-building, held when the frame is erected). They certainly do not come out short at the feast connected with this. As a matter of fact, most chiefs understand very well how to entice from their people whatever they might like to have.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_151_FmTrukL] 'The risks of nocturnal trysts are increased by a curfew, instituted under the Japanese to curb such behavior, and continued to the present by the island chiefs. A conch is blown at about nine o’clock by the island policeman or secretary as a signal for all who are not fishing or otherwise legitimately occupied to remain in their houses. Anyone who is seen and recognized thereafter at any distance from his own house is called before the chief and is usually at a loss to explain himself. This does not, however, involve the girl whom he intended to meet or met (unless he has just escaped from the house amid hue and cry and is thus identified), and the worst consequence is usually a few days of enforced labor on the island’s paths, to which little stigma is attached.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_152_FmTrukL] 'In former times an important item in a chief’s equipment was the conch-shell trumpet ( sewi). It could be blown only by the chief, himself, and was not used except to summon his people to an important meeting on an emergency matter. Nowadays the conch is used to call the people to routine meetings, to community work, and to Protestant [Page 145] church services. The prohibition against unauthorized persons blowing it has been relaxed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_153_FmTrukL] Islanders also used special calls when communicating with each other over a larger distance: 'The hearing, like the eyes of the natives, is also acute. They call to one another over long distances and make them-selves understood. The caller puts his hands trumpet-like to his mouth and shouts through them. If the one called has understood, [Page 239] he answers in the same way. When calling, the first syllables are uttered quickly, whereas the latter ones are stressed slowly and strongly.'

The Chuuk Islands, which form part of the eastern Caroline Islands, are encircled by a barrier bank composed of some 85 sand and coral islets. The bank (often referred to as a reef) encloses a lagoon 822 square miles (2,129 square km) in area and has a diameter of some 40 miles (65 km). Chief islands of the group are Weno (formerly Moen), Tonoas, Fefan, Uman, Uatschaluk (Udot), and Tol. The islands were sighted by the Spanish explorer Álvaro Saavedra in 1528. They were visited occasionally by 19th-century traders and whalers and were included in the German purchase of parts of Micronesia from Spain (1899). Annexed by Japan (1914) and strongly fortified for World War II, the islands (known as the Truk Islands until 1990) were heavily attacked, bypassed, and blockaded by the Allies during the war. The sunken hulls of Japanese ships remain there, along with ruined weapons and fortifications on land. Together with the other islands in what are now the Federated States of Micronesia, the Chuuk group was part of the U.S.-administered United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1947 to 1986.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_157_FmTrukL] 'The high islands of the Chuuk group have mangrove swamps along their coasts, as well as rainforests in the central mountainous areas. The native people are Micronesians who fish, raise pigs and poultry, and grow taro, breadfruit, yams, and bananas. Copra is the chief cash crop. The islands are popular with scuba divers, who come to explore the lagoon’s shipwrecks, many of which have become foundations for new reef growth. The largest urban area is on Weno; the rest of the population resides mostly in traditional villages scattered around the islands. Chuuk has a commercial dock and an international airport, both located on Weno. Total land area 49.1 square miles (127.2 square km). Pop. (2010) 48,654.'

For better control the government appointed six head-chiefs, banished some swashbucklers who did not want to submit, and turned out the Japanese. With this a peaceful development was initiated. The missions (Protestant mission since 1879, Catholic mission since 1912) were able to work undisturbed. Unfortunately, the German government took little notice of Truk, since it was too preoccupied with the other islands. Yet many things were accomplished. Under the last director of the station, A. Überhorst, the lagoon was given new impetus in every respect. The relationship between officials and the population was usually a good one, under Mr. Überhorst even a cordial one. Anyone who was on Truk in those years certainly did not see any bad treatment of the natives. Much was done also with regard to health; in particular Dr. Mayer and his wife traveled from island to island without rest in order to take care of the sick. If during the Japanese occupation a young naval officer was not ashamed to assert that the Germans had done nothing for the islands, anyone who lived on the islands during the Japanese period can only say from the heart: “God protect the poor Truk people under the Japanese.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_166_FmTrukL] We are unsure as to how thorough the disarming of native islanders was.

By the end of that decade, however, the ridges and hilltops near Peniyesene were being fortified by the Japanese military and with the outbreak of World War II a large concentration of Japanese troops was [Page 5] billeted in the village. To make way for them, village people were forcibly relocated and the school ceased to function. The classroom building subsequently was destroyed by Allied bombs and has not been rebuilt. Informal classes were held in Peniyesene early in the American period but subsequently all school children from the village have attended public or parochial schools located elsewhere.'

A chief's brothers or sons might act on his behalf to intimidate or attack someone who had offended him. But it was control of magical power, either by the chief or one his brothers or sons, that made improper conduct liable to punishment. Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery. All such knowledge gave punitive power to chiefs and important specialists. People stressed maintaining the appearance of propriety in behavior so as not to give just cause for offense.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_183_FmTrukL] Prior to 'pacification', violent conflict played out in raids and battles between rival groups of armed men: 'Within districts, conflict arose over land, succession to chiefship, theft, adultery, and avenging homicide. Between districts, it arose over attentions to local women by outside men, the status of one district as subordinate to another, and rights of access to fishing areas. Formal procedures for terminating conflict between districts involved payments of valuables and land by the loosing to the winning side.

Martial arts included an elaborate system of throws and holds by which an unarmed man could kill, maim or disarm an armed opponent.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_184_FmTrukL] Competition between rival chiefs over the control of land and people was a major factor: 'Traditional Micronesian life was characterized by a belief in the stability of society and culture. People suffered occasional natural disasters, such as cyclones or droughts, but their goal after encountering one of these was to reconstitute the previous state of affairs. Wars occurred in most areas from time to time, mainly at the instigation of competing chiefs. At stake was the control of land—a limited resource—and followers, but there were usually few casualties. Living in small communities on small territories, Micronesians learned to adjust to their neighbours, to remain on good terms with most of them most of the time, and to develop techniques of reconciliation when fights did break out. Micronesians traditionally depended on the cultivation of plant crops and on fishing in shallow reef waters. Because arable land was in short supply for the relatively dense population, Micronesians had a strong practical basis for their attachment to locality and lands. Land rights were usually held through lineages or extended family groups, often backed up by traditions of ancestral origins on the land.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_185_FmTrukL] Conflict among chiefs and their followers did not terminate entirely with 'pacification', although the population was disarmed in the early 20th century: 'In 1904 the disarming of the Truk people was undertaken by the “Kondor.” There were 436 guns and 2,531 cartridges confiscated. For better control the government appointed six head-chiefs, banished some swashbucklers who did not want to submit, and turned out the Japanese. With this a peaceful development was initiated. The missions (Protestant mission since 1879, Catholic mission since 1912) were able to work undisturbed. Unfortunately, the German government took little notice of Truk, since it was too preoccupied with the other islands. Yet many things were accomplished. Under the last director of the station, A. Überhorst, the lagoon was given new impetus in every respect. The relationship between officials and the population was usually a good one, under Mr. Überhorst even a cordial one. Anyone who was on Truk in those years certainly did not see any bad treatment of the natives. Much was done also with regard to health; in particular Dr. Mayer and his wife traveled from island to island without rest in order to take care of the sick. If during the Japanese occupation a young naval officer was not ashamed to assert that the Germans had done nothing for the islands, anyone who lived on the islands during the Japanese period can only say from the heart: “God protect the poor Truk people under the Japanese.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_186_FmTrukL] 'On the main islands the German government introduced head chiefs (somol lap) who carried the flag. There were six of them, one each on Poloas, Uman, Fefan, Wöla, Udot, and Pol /Pul/. The smaller islands likewise belonged to the sphere of power of the head chiefs. But even this institution could not link the tribes together within themselves or with one another. Some of the lower chiefs sympathize with the head chief for egotistical reasons; others fight against him violently for the same reasons. One who is with him today might be against him tomorrow because he somehow stepped on his toes. It is often enough for the subchief to fight the head chief if his neighboring chief supports him. Thus the picture is constantly changing. [Page 125] There is a continuous, sometimes quiet, sometimes open, warfare of the subchiefs against the head chiefs, the lower chiefs among themselves, the common people against the chiefs. The main reason for this disagreeable phenomenon is the limitless egotism of the Truk people. Everyone strives more or less to be something of a chief also. Strong families who do not like the chief attempt to isolate themselves and choose one from their midst. In addition to this, there are also old family enmities and disputes about land. It is obvious that the islands will never be able to achieve peaceful development in this manner. It is difficult to say who is most to blame for it. In any case the chiefs are not to be pitied, because they behave themselves accordingly. They are to be blamed mostly for the exploitation of the people, their corruptibility, and partiality. Many of them unhesitatingly accept money and objects and help the giver, no matter how many times he is in the wrong.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_187_FmTrukL] The Japanese army constructed military installations and stationed troops on the islands, especially in World War II: 'The Japanese constructed an elementary school in Peniyesene during the early 1930s to serve several villages and this meant that many of Peniyesene’s school-age children obtained at least three years of Japanese education during the 1930s.

Sometimes the people become so excited that the parties insult each other, grab each other, and come to blows, so that the meeting has to be dissolved. The following remark was made in a kobu[unknown] which I attended: “He is a bad fellow because he stole my log.” The person insulted in such a manner jumped up angrily and defended himself so convincingly that the accuser let his head sink and replied dejectedly: “ Kinisou, mei bu[unknown]me rem, excuse me, you are right.” In another kobu[unknown] a subchief said to the head chief: “I do not like you as head chief, for you put some into paradise, others into hell.” With this plain allusion to his partiality, the head chief became very excited, while the audience laughed.

Once master over life and death, now he can only order imprisonment or hard labor. The hard labor usually consists of pulling grass on public roads or carrying stones to canoe wharves. Nevertheless the people do not hurt themselves at this work and get out of it whenever they can. Instead of pulling grass, they sit smoking and talking on the road. They also know how to appear sick in order to be left completely free. The feeding of condemned persons is a matter for his relatives. For the duration of the punishment the natives live in the jail ( kalapus) . Each head chief has two kalapus, one for men and the other for women. On some islands the kalapus contributed greatly to the depravity of morals, since both sexes were housed in the same room. Similarly the wardens of the prisoners used the opportunity to satisfy their passions and to do business on the side by hiring out the imprisoned women.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_403_FmTrukL] 'On the other hand, the chief acquired a number of restrictions on the exercise of his power which either did not exist before, or which had not been so clear and consistent. It was not possible to appeal a chief’s judicial decisions, or to go to higher authority to change or reverse a chief’s plans for coordinated activity. With the coming of the American administration a further restriction appeared in the, theoretically at least, independent community legislature to whose laws even the chief is subject. Under the Americans there is also an independent judiciary, so that the chief is no longer allowed, in theory, to mediate interlineage disputes. On balance, however, it would seem that the chiefs’ coordinating and planning powers were increased despite the new restrictions. The provision of effective and usable sanctions probably outweighs all the new limits imposed on the chiefs’ powers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_404_FmTrukL] But colonial forces also backed chiefly resolutions in a manner not possible in the pre-colonial period: 'The Germans also provided effective force to support the chief’s decisions. Anyone refusing to obey a chief’s orders or rejecting his decision in a dispute was liable to internment in the “calaboose” spoken of so approvingly by the old man at the beginning of this paper. The might of the German, and, in turn, the Japanese and American administrations stood behind a chief’s words; and although some kind of appeal from his decisions was usually possible, the likelihood of anyone refusing to obey his clearly expressed mandates and escaping unscathed had become rather small.'

Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_410_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_411_FmTrukL] 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_412_FmTrukL] 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_413_FmTrukL] The colonial government appointed head chiefs for the main islands: 'On the main islands the German government introduced head chiefs (somol lap) who carried the flag. There were six of them, one each on Poloas, Uman, Fefan, Wöla, Udot, and Pol /Pul/. The smaller islands likewise belonged to the sphere of power of the head chiefs. But even this institution could not link the tribes together within themselves or with one another. Some of the lower chiefs sympathize with the head chief for egotistical reasons; others fight against him violently for the same reasons. One who is with him today might be against him tomorrow because he somehow stepped on his toes. It is often enough for the subchief to fight the head chief if his neighboring chief supports him. Thus the picture is constantly changing. [Page 125] There is a continuous, sometimes quiet, sometimes open, warfare of the subchiefs against the head chiefs, the lower chiefs among themselves, the common people against the chiefs. The main reason for this disagreeable phenomenon is the limitless egotism of the Truk people. Everyone strives more or less to be something of a chief also. Strong families who do not like the chief attempt to isolate themselves and choose one from their midst. In addition to this, there are also old family enmities and disputes about land. It is obvious that the islands will never be able to achieve peaceful development in this manner. It is difficult to say who is most to blame for it. In any case the chiefs are not to be pitied, because they behave themselves accordingly. They are to be blamed mostly for the exploitation of the people, their corruptibility, and partiality. Many of them unhesitatingly accept money and objects and help the giver, no matter how many times he is in the wrong.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_414_FmTrukL] However, these head chiefs were not bureaucrats. Some islanders were recruited by the colonial administration as petty officials: 'The purpose of the schools for natives, judging from both reported policies and the Japanese school regulations was to civilize the natives and make them into loyal and economically useful citizens of the Japanese empire. While there was theoretically no limit to the higher education which the native child with sufficient ability and financial support might obtain, in actual fact only a minority of Trukese children attended the fourth and fifth grades, and only a minority of those completing fifth grade obtained further education at the vocational schools. Apparently no Trukese native obtained any academic education beyond fifth grade, except incidentally along with vocational training. The system was geared in effect to produce a supply of general laborers and domestic servants who understood the Japanese language, plus a small elite of skilled laborers and petty officials.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_425_FmTrukL] Writing in the colonial period, Bollig describes the resolution of disputes in public meetings: 'The chief does all these duties in the kobu[unknown], the public meeting. Men as well as women are invited to this kobu[unknown]. All the participants are called together by the blowing of the large shell from the chief’s house. The kobu[unknown] takes place in the udd, the large men’s house. All the dealings of the tribe are discussed in it, marital matters, land matters, quarrels, in short, all the linen, whether clean or dirty, is spread out before all eyes. Everybody is allowed to talk and present his complaints. Of course there is no lack of amusing scenes too. Sometimes the people become so excited that the parties insult each other, grab each other, and come to blows, so that the meeting has to be dissolved. The following remark was made in a kobu[unknown] which I attended: “He is a bad fellow because he stole my log.” The person insulted in such a manner jumped up angrily and defended himself so convincingly that the accuser let his head sink and replied dejectedly: “ Kinisou, mei bu[unknown]me rem, excuse me, you are right.” In another kobu[unknown] a subchief said to the head chief: “I do not like you as head chief, for you put some into paradise, others into hell.” With this plain allusion to his partiality, the head chief became very excited, while the audience laughed. From the same chief came the familiar quotation: “ siwilin ni efot, ni efot; siwilim mas eu, mas eu, ina Lamalamen Moses, /116/ tooth for tooth, eye for eye, that is the religion of Moses.” As one sees, the chief concerned had not read the Protestant Bible in vain and knew very well how to cloak his thirst for revenge very nicely. Things go along quite pleasantly in the kobu[unknown] of the Truk people. Each one chatters as long and as [Page 127] much as he likes. If he uses sharp, objectionable expressions, wiser ones will certainly call out to him: “ a emuen, it is enough.” Some smoke, some eat. One sits on the floor, another one on an upturned bowl, or anywhere else. Here and there one also sees some who are asleep, tired from listening for a long time. In short it goes along in true Kanaka fashion, and the result of the kobu[unknown], usually lasting for hours, is “much ado about nothing.” The matter at issue remains as it was, or it has become even more complicated. The government has often tried to give the kobu[unknown] a more serious air, but quite in vain. The main person at the kobu[unknown] is the chief, who makes the decision in the individual cases. Formerly his decision was absolutely decisive for all questions. In more recent times appeal to a higher authority, to the head chief and the government, has been possible. The government has also pruned the jurisdiction of the chief. Some things are reserved solely for the head chief, some solely for the government representative. During the kobu[unknown], the chief is surrounded by his relatives and advisors who watch over him. If he wants to say something that does not suit them, they call out to him: “ a niku[unknown], that is too much.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_426_FmTrukL] The judicial powers of the chiefs were diminished somewhat in the colonial period: 'The chief’s authority to punish no longer goes very far. Once master over life and death, now he can only order imprisonment or hard labor. The hard labor usually consists of pulling grass on public roads or carrying stones to canoe wharves. Nevertheless the people do not hurt themselves at this work and get out of it whenever they can. Instead of pulling grass, they sit smoking and talking on the road. They also know how to appear sick in order to be left completely free. The feeding of condemned persons is a matter for his relatives. For the duration of the punishment the natives live in the jail ( kalapus) . Each head chief has two kalapus, one for men and the other for women. On some islands the kalapus contributed greatly to the depravity of morals, since both sexes were housed in the same room. Similarly the wardens of the prisoners used the opportunity to satisfy their passions and to do business on the side by hiring out the imprisoned women.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_427_FmTrukL] 'On the other hand, the chief acquired a number of restrictions on the exercise of his power which either did not exist before, or which had not been so clear and consistent. It was not possible to appeal a chief’s judicial decisions, or to go to higher authority to change or reverse a chief’s plans for coordinated activity. With the coming of the American administration a further restriction appeared in the, theoretically at least, independent community legislature to whose laws even the chief is subject. Under the Americans there is also an independent judiciary, so that the chief is no longer allowed, in theory, to mediate interlineage disputes. On balance, however, it would seem that the chiefs’ coordinating and planning powers were increased despite the new restrictions. The provision of effective and usable sanctions probably outweighs all the new limits imposed on the chiefs’ powers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_428_FmTrukL] But colonial forces also backed chiefly resolutions in a manner not possible in the pre-colonial period: 'The Germans also provided effective force to support the chief’s decisions. Anyone refusing to obey a chief’s orders or rejecting his decision in a dispute was liable to internment in the “calaboose” spoken of so approvingly by the old man at the beginning of this paper. The might of the German, and, in turn, the Japanese and American administrations stood behind a chief’s words; and although some kind of appeal from his decisions was usually possible, the likelihood of anyone refusing to obey his clearly expressed mandates and escaping unscathed had become rather small.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_429_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, tribal laws were fluid rather than fixed, although the colonial administration increasingly sought to impose its own regulations: 'The main task of the chief is the laying down and execution of the bu[unknown]un fanu, that is, the tribal laws. In practice the bu[unknown] is usually illusory, since nobody wants to follow it. Not for nothing do the Truk people say sarcastically about the conditions on their islands: “ en sob me bu[unknown]un, each district has its own laws,” or what is even worse: “ en me bu[unknown]un,” freely translated: “So many heads, so many meanings.” Moreover, it is a duty of the chief to communicate to the people the regulations of the government, to see that they are carried out, and to collect the head tax.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_430_FmTrukL] Apparently, many customary regulations were no longer enforced under foreign administration: The effect of this ruling was to deprive the granting corporation of its residual title; once the grant was made, the grantee had full title. The grantee need not now render first fruits or obtain the grantor’s approval for transactions he wished to arrange. The head of the granting corporation could no longer claim to be sowuppwún; this title now belonged to the head of the recipient corporation if he wished to claim it. Some people on Romónum continue to follow traditional practice and continue to render gifts of first fruits to the traditional sowuppwún as a matter of courtesy, and there are some who still try to assert their right to first fruits under the traditional system. No one is compelled to follow traditional practice and a number of people no longer do so. It is my impression that scarcely anyone would do so if he felt that he would be seriously inconvenienced by it.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_431_FmTrukL] Goodenough mentions colonial courts that dealt with issues that could not be resolved on the local level: 'As soon as courts were re-established, they were deluged with property disputes. The Japanese had treated grants of corporation land to the children of one of its men as if they were an inheritance by a man’s children of his individually owned land. The result was that many disputes coming before the American high court were between the members of a corporation and the children of its men. The latter were disputing the residual title of the former and claiming full title for themselves, and the former were asserting their confiscatory and reversionary rights under traditional residual title. The court undertook seriously to follow local custom, but some witnesses presented the rulings of the Japanese courts as representing local custom whereas others presented the traditional system as local custom, depending on which representation was to their immediate advantage.The high court, I am told, chose to follow the precedent set by the Japanese and ruled that if it could be established that a corporation grant to the children of one of its men had been made with the consent of the corporation’s members, then the children had [Page 80] the same rights as if it had been their father’s personal property.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_432_FmTrukL] Accordingly, native systems of dispute resolution coexisted with formal colonial courts.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts are supported by the state ♣ present ♥</b> Colonial courts were supported by the colonial military administration.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Criminal Prosecution ♣ ♥</b> We are unsure whether colonial courts enforced criminal prosecution.

During the kobu[unknown], the chief is surrounded by his relatives and advisors who watch over him. If he wants to say something that does not suit them, they call out to him: “ a niku[unknown], that is too much.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_435_FmTrukL] The judicial powers of the chiefs were diminished somewhat in the colonial period: 'The chief’s authority to punish no longer goes very far. Once master over life and death, now he can only order imprisonment or hard labor. The hard labor usually consists of pulling grass on public roads or carrying stones to canoe wharves. Nevertheless the people do not hurt themselves at this work and get out of it whenever they can. Instead of pulling grass, they sit smoking and talking on the road. They also know how to appear sick in order to be left completely free. The feeding of condemned persons is a matter for his relatives. For the duration of the punishment the natives live in the jail ( kalapus) . Each head chief has two kalapus, one for men and the other for women. On some islands the kalapus contributed greatly to the depravity of morals, since both sexes were housed in the same room. Similarly the wardens of the prisoners used the opportunity to satisfy their passions and to do business on the side by hiring out the imprisoned women.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_436_FmTrukL] 'On the other hand, the chief acquired a number of restrictions on the exercise of his power which either did not exist before, or which had not been so clear and consistent. It was not possible to appeal a chief’s judicial decisions, or to go to higher authority to change or reverse a chief’s plans for coordinated activity. With the coming of the American administration a further restriction appeared in the, theoretically at least, independent community legislature to whose laws even the chief is subject. Under the Americans there is also an independent judiciary, so that the chief is no longer allowed, in theory, to mediate interlineage disputes. On balance, however, it would seem that the chiefs’ coordinating and planning powers were increased despite the new restrictions. The provision of effective and usable sanctions probably outweighs all the new limits imposed on the chiefs’ powers.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_437_FmTrukL] But colonial forces also backed chiefly resolutions in a manner not possible in the pre-colonial period: 'The Germans also provided effective force to support the chief’s decisions. Anyone refusing to obey a chief’s orders or rejecting his decision in a dispute was liable to internment in the “calaboose” spoken of so approvingly by the old man at the beginning of this paper. The might of the German, and, in turn, the Japanese and American administrations stood behind a chief’s words; and although some kind of appeal from his decisions was usually possible, the likelihood of anyone refusing to obey his clearly expressed mandates and escaping unscathed had become rather small.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_438_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, tribal laws were fluid rather than fixed, although the colonial administration increasingly sought to impose its own regulations: 'The main task of the chief is the laying down and execution of the bu[unknown]un fanu, that is, the tribal laws. In practice the bu[unknown] is usually illusory, since nobody wants to follow it. Not for nothing do the Truk people say sarcastically about the conditions on their islands: “ en sob me bu[unknown]un, each district has its own laws,” or what is even worse: “ en me bu[unknown]un,” freely translated: “So many heads, so many meanings.” Moreover, it is a duty of the chief to communicate to the people the regulations of the government, to see that they are carried out, and to collect the head tax.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_439_FmTrukL] Apparently, many customary regulations were no longer enforced under foreign administration: The effect of this ruling was to deprive the granting corporation of its residual title; once the grant was made, the grantee had full title. The grantee need not now render first fruits or obtain the grantor’s approval for transactions he wished to arrange. The head of the granting corporation could no longer claim to be sowuppwún; this title now belonged to the head of the recipient corporation if he wished to claim it. Some people on Romónum continue to follow traditional practice and continue to render gifts of first fruits to the traditional sowuppwún as a matter of courtesy, and there are some who still try to assert their right to first fruits under the traditional system. No one is compelled to follow traditional practice and a number of people no longer do so. It is my impression that scarcely anyone would do so if he felt that he would be seriously inconvenienced by it.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_440_FmTrukL] Goodenough mentions colonial courts that dealt with issues that could not be resolved on the local level: 'As soon as courts were re-established, they were deluged with property disputes. The Japanese had treated grants of corporation land to the children of one of its men as if they were an inheritance by a man’s children of his individually owned land. The result was that many disputes coming before the American high court were between the members of a corporation and the children of its men. The latter were disputing the residual title of the former and claiming full title for themselves, and the former were asserting their confiscatory and reversionary rights under traditional residual title. The court undertook seriously to follow local custom, but some witnesses presented the rulings of the Japanese courts as representing local custom whereas others presented the traditional system as local custom, depending on which representation was to their immediate advantage.The high court, I am told, chose to follow the precedent set by the Japanese and ruled that if it could be established that a corporation grant to the children of one of its men had been made with the consent of the corporation’s members, then the children had [Page 80] the same rights as if it had been their father’s personal property.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_442_FmTrukL] 'Individually-owned property was inherited by the owner's children. Corporately-owned property was inherited by the corporation's 'children' (the children of its men) when the corporation's membership died out.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_443_FmTrukL] Women commonly held property, but husbands and children retained usufruct rights over the property of mothers and wives: 'The right to private property exists among the Truk natives. Everyone of them, be it man or woman, adult or child, can own property, for example, land, houses, cattle, money, etc. Whatever the wife brings into the marriage remains wholly at her disposal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_444_FmTrukL] 'The husband and children, however, do have usufruct rights to her property. If she goes back to her family because of death or divorce, then she takes her property with her again. In practice a certain communism prevails, since siblings, members of the same kin group, often live together and cultivate their lands and enjoy the fruits together. This, however, lasts only as long as there are no quarrels among the families.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_445_FmTrukL] Elder brothers held supervision rights over property owned by the sib: 'In contrast to this indirectly communistic property, there is also that which is directly communistic, for example, land. They call it fanu uon ar puipui, land of their brotherhood. Yet the oldest brother plays a special part in connection with all the property. He not only has the supervision and usufruct right to the property of the younger siblings, which goes back to the common [Page 132] father, but he can also withdraw it from them. Since this not infrequently happens, the oldest is usually also the richest in each family. /121/ The oldest has no rights over the property which the younger ones have obtained from other sources. To make up for the fact that the oldest has such extensive rights, he has the obligation to care for his siblings in certain ways.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_446_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, disputes over land rights were common: 'The land rights of the Truk people are not based on justice, but on the right of the stronger, the cleverer. There is hardly a plot of land with a clear legal history, and for that reason there are the constant assertions of legal claims, the eternal lawsuits over land. The boldest and most cunning persons always have the best land on Truk. Pretenses for bringing legal claims to foreign property before the chief are easily found in the confused conditions. And once they are found, the Kanakas’ inexhaustible power of invention and art of lying take care of making them convincing to others. That briberies of chiefs, interpreters, and witnesses play a tremendous part in this is obvious, considering the character of the Truk people. No means is too wicked for them in order to “profit. ”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_447_FmTrukL] 'A source of land disputes is the exchange of lands. For example: Soni and Soledon exchange two pieces of land. Soni now cultivates his land, while Soledon lets it lie fallow. Soledon dies. His children, who are not on good terms with Soni, cancel the exchange and take possession of the productive piece of land as property of their deceased father. Soni resists. The parties quarrel for years. Sometimes the one wins, sometimes the other, but no one yields.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_448_FmTrukL] In practice, the boundaries between land owned by different individuals could be vague: 'The boundaries of the lands are very vague. They change continually under the hands of both neighbors. Sometimes the one, sometimes the other one, goes beyond them. Then they quarrel. What A has planted B tears out, with the argument that it is already on his territory. What B has planted A tears out, with the same argument. Now which of the two is right?' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_449_FmTrukL] 'With such uncertain legal conditions it is not at all surprising that quarrels over land are daily events on Truk. Every death, every divorce, every new marriage has a coil of rats’ tails in quarrels as a result. The boundless egotism of the Truk natives is responsible for all this. Everybody wants to have as much as possible. A Trukese can quarrel for years about a tree, a plant, or a foot of land, even though he has plenty of trees that are not producing anything because of lack of care. The German government gave the natives land documents on which the owner, along with all his pieces of land, was recorded. /123/ The hopes placed on this have not been fulfilled. Today everything is as confused as before.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_450_FmTrukL] Rights in land were differentiated from rights in plantings: 'The Truk people are familiar with a distinction of the ground from what is planted on it. Thus, somebody may possess a piece of land, but the trees that stand on it belong to other people. They or their parents once planted the trees on his property, which is permissible according to Truk customs. If the owners of the trees are dishonest, they need only clear the field beginning from the trees, continue to cultivate, and the poor owner is dispossessed. What confused situations that causes in the case of an eventual transfer of the piece of land to another is easily understandable. I myself have had difficulties for years, since certain people still held on to “their” trees after the piece of land had long been the property of the mission. Only the felling of the trees put an end to all claims.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_451_FmTrukL] Ownership was claimed and asserted through material markings: 'The natives try to document their right of ownership to pieces of land by clearing something on it from time to time, or they build huts on the individual pieces of land, which they then inhabit temporarily. Dying fathers give their children directions to bury them on their pieces of land so that their grave might thus be proof of ownership for the future. One can often hear in the kobu[unknown] that this is precisely what the people refer to.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_452_FmTrukL] 'The riri, that is, to bind, forms a strange title deed on the Truk Islands. For example, somebody sees a tree which bears many fruits. Since he would like some too, he takes the ubud of a coconut palm and wraps it around a branch of the tree in order to make his intention known publicly. In many cases the owner resists such oppression and tears off the ubud. But also in many cases he keeps quiet in order to avoid bigger quarrels.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_453_FmTrukL] 'I myself have had experiences with the riri in that the girls “bound” pineapples for themselves on my plot of land, which I did not allow, of course. The riri is also done in connection with animals, only by words here, of course. They say, for example: “ A riri lon lelugei enan tugo, it is bound in my heart, this chicken, ” that is, it is my property. Then they also further take the wor d riri with a moral obligation. One says, for example: [Page 135] “U a riri uon enan a[unknown]a[unknown], I am bound to that work, ” that is, I am obliged to do it. In any case the former riri is the root of the latter.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_454_FmTrukL] Land could be transferred through barter in the manner of other goods; it appears that barter was widely used even in the colonial period: 'The acquisition of property on Truk is usually done by means of barter. Lands, houses, and canoes are bartered. Smaller units of exchange are sebi (wooden bowls), deig (curcuma), faupar (red shell disks), hip mats, modesty bands, fishing nets, aromatic oils, coconut cord, home-grown tobacco, and sleeping mats. These products of native industry are not present in like quantity or in like quality on all the islands. Thus, Sapesis on Fefan is famous for its fine bowls, Pol for curcuma and oils, Iluk for its fine hip mats.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_455_FmTrukL] Bollig claims that vague and flexible property arrangements among islanders impacted the management of plantations in the colonial period: 'A few decades ago the sandy shore was wilderness. Only gradually, under the influence of Europeans, were coconuts planted,for only this kind of cultivation is possible in the sand. Regular, clean grounds, however, are not to the taste of the Truk people. Coconut trees, breadfruit trees, and forest trees stand higgledy-piggledy, usually so densely that some of them never bear. The confused legal conditions of the natives are shown most glaringly on the shore. Thirty trees, which stand side by side, belong to several owners, for example: coconut tree No. 1 [Page 157] belongs to A, Nos. 2 and 3 to B, No. 4 to A again, etc. One can imagine how many quarrels about the falling fruit result from that.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_463_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lease ♣ present ♥</b> Prior to colonization, senior lineages and dominant clans could grant residential and usufruct rights to junior groups on a provisional basis: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_464_FmTrukL] Individuals could also grant provisional land rights to other individuals: 'Land was held privately both by individuals and matrilineal, corporate descent groups. Rights in undeveloped space, productive soil, trees and gardens were separable.

Grantors and grantees could be either individuals or corporations. Full rights went to the survivor on the death or extinction of the other.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_465_FmTrukL] We are unsure whether this constitutes lease according to our Code Book, but have assumed so for the time being. Monetized lease arrangements were introduced in the colonial period:: 'Rent for money is purely a foreign introduction and is still poorly understood on some of the outer islands. On Puluwat recently the owner of the plot on which the sub-dispensary stands was worried about accepting rent from the island. He believed that after a number of years as he gradually received the full value of the land in money his title to the land would inexorably slip away from him. On the other hand, he did want to be paid for the food trees cleared away to prepare the site of the building.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_466_FmTrukL]<div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Lease Rights ♣ ♥</b> However, chiefs occasionally confiscated property granted to junior lineages and provisional title holders in case of disobedience (such as failure to deliver food prestations on the occasion of feasts): 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.'

To make up for the fact that the oldest has such extensive rights, he has the obligation to care for his siblings in certain ways.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_485_FmTrukL] The presence of both individually-held property and matrilineal descent groups affected the treatment of womens' property after their passing: 'If a man dies, the lands which belonged to him personally pass on to his children. Such land is called fanuei me uon semei, my land from my father. The particulars of the distribution are left completely to his discretion. He can also exclude one child or another, as he likes. The lands that he has jointly with his brothers, however, are taken by them. It frequently happens that the brothers, in case the children are minors, take all the lands in order to administer them, whereby one piece or another remains in their hands forever. In general the father considers only the children from the present marriage. Children from former marriages, who live with the mother’s relatives, are not considered. For that they would have had to rejoin him again later. The mother’s property too only in part passes to the children, since her brothers and sisters likewise do not want to come out short.'

Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_492_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_493_FmTrukL] According to Goodenough, levirate/sororate marriages were practiced: 'Marriage took place for women a bit before and for men a bit after the age of 20. Premarital courtship was covert and included sexual relations. Residence was usually matrilocal. Divorce, common before the birth of children, was rare thereafter. It could be initiated by either spouse and was often instigated by the wife's brothers. Levirate and sororate remarriages were valued. To keep soil and trees that had been granted to the children of a lineage's men circulating back, marriage preferences with one or another kind of cousin, varying from locality to locality, were widespread.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_494_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, polygyny was fairly widespread, partly as a result of levirate/sororate marriages: 'Polygamy (1) 1 a akaruu, he has two wives; a akaulu[unknown]at, he has three wives, etc. is very widespread on Truk. Men with two to nine wives are numerous. One becomes polygamous through the death of his brother, for out of brotherly love he has an obligation to take the widow for himself (levirate marriage). Another one marries a widow with daughters and takes the latter, as soon as they are old enough, as secondary wives. A third takes the sisters of his wife for himself, which is the case for most polygamous situations. The reasons for polygamy vary. One wants to keep landed property together by this means, or to concentrate it in his hands; another wants to have workers, since the secondary wives fish for him. Strangely enough, the motive forces for polygamy are said to be mostly the women themselves. They offer their daughters, sisters, [Page 109] and nieces to their husbands as secondary wives, in order that no strange family come in. This happens especially if they have no children, for if a strange woman comes in and gives birth to children, they will be pushed aside. They try to prevent this by means of the above measure. If polygamy has come about in this way, a peaceful life together is possible, for the women stay together in their own interests. But if the women come from different families or tribes, living together is out of the question. They live apart, and the man has the pleasant task of going back and forth. Unpleasantness and jealousy between the rivals are the order of the day. First one and then the other thinks she is being slighted. First one is tired, then the other. And the husband must always be on the move in order to keep everybody happy. Some polygamous situations which I knew were changing constantly. At one time the husband had four, then some ran away, later they increased to six, etc. A somewhat decent family life is inconceivable. The eventual /101/ children always go with the mother, but the father knows the means for drawing them to him when they are older, so that he will have a work force. Some polygamists are very generous with their wives. They are quickly ready to hand them over to their unmarried relatives, because it gives them advantages. They are able to take a new one and still consider the old one indirectly as their own.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_495_FmTrukL] Bollig claims that polyandry was rare: 'Polyandry seems to be rarer. I knew of only one case, in which two brothers had a common wife.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_496_FmTrukL] But Caughey claims that while polygamy was present, monogamy was the norm for most: 'In the traditional society polygynous marriages rarely occurred. Since marriage sets up heavy obligations to the wife’s lineage, most men did not want to increase this burden, especially by marrying into different lineages. Interpreted differently, the same reasons provided the rationale for those few cases of polygny that did occur. A man who married more than one wife demonstrated his importance and power. It showed that he was capable of engaging in burdensome social relationships with more than one lineage or that he was able to turn this subordinate relationship into one where he dominated. A famous man of bravery on Fáánakkar was once married at the same time to five wives from four different lineages. Later, in a grand gesture of kindness, he gave one of them away to a wifeless brother.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_497_FmTrukL] Expert confirmation is needed on the matter. Information on a possible decline of polygyny in favour of monogamy after Christianization may also be needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal Elite Polygamy ♣ present ♥</b> The classification of variables here is slightly misleading.

Goodenough provides a general description of courtship and sexual relations: 'Marriage took place for women a bit before and for men a bit after the age of 20. Premarital courtship was covert and included sexual relations. Residence was usually matrilocal. Divorce, common before the birth of children, was rare thereafter. It could be initiated by either spouse and was often instigated by the wife's brothers. Levirate and sororate remarriages were valued. To keep soil and trees that had been granted to the children of a lineage's men circulating back, marriage preferences with one or another kind of cousin, varying from locality to locality, were widespread.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_498_FmTrukL] According to Goodenough, premarital sexual relations were common: 'LIKE many other Oceanic peoples, the natives of Truk allow their adolescents considerable freedom in sexual matters. There is no stigma of any kind attached to young men or women who have sexual relations before marriage. No value whatsoever is attributed to virginity in girls or boys. All informants agree that girls normally start having intercourse when, at about the age of fourteen, their breasts become fairly well developed. The initial sexual experiences of boys occur at a somewhat later age, between the ages of sixteen and seventeen.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_499_FmTrukL] Bollig claims that 'licentious' behavior was common and tolerated: 'Inemes, the Venus of the Truk people, has to be mentioned separately, because her cult is very different in character from that of the other spirits. She is the protectress of lechery, and everything that goes with it is dedicated to her. None of the gods and spirits has as extensive a circle of worshipers as Inemes. This fact alone is proof of the low moral position of the Truk people, who know no distinction between licit and illicit sexual intercourse and who, despite the oloudd have no conception of chastity and even less of virginity.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_500_FmTrukL] 'There is another detestable custom which likewise derives its origin from Inemes. It is the puanelö or nadelö (1). A number of young fellows get together and announce their licentiousness. They hang up the faren I[unknown]emes, decorate it with wreaths, necklaces, etc., paint themselves yellow from head to foot, and roam about to find companions in their lechery. Women and girls who do not want to co-operate are sprinkled with “magic oil” so that their hair falls out and ugly wounds and boils appear.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_501_FmTrukL] 'During this time also moonlight dances in honor of Inemes are performed. They are the notorious ouönu dances.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_502_FmTrukL] 'It is not surprising that so many marriages break up as a consequence of these ouönu dances. The licentiousness of the women is worst during this time. Since it is forbidden to pick coconuts, they lie in wait for the men so as to catch any in the act of violating the prohibition. If they have happily found one, they tear his clothes, scratch him, take away his food, etc. That is the detestable worship of Inemes, a dark point in the lives of the Truk natives, who otherwise are so congenial.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_503_FmTrukL] 'Jealousy among the women is in general not very great. It is worse among some men, who on account of it treat their wives like slaves. Wherever the wives go, they accompany them. They never make long trips, in order always to be able to be home at night. At the slightest suspicion, they beat their wives. Men of this type are not popular. Their jealousy is smiled at pityingly by the more liberal-minded. It is worthless, for the women are slier than the men in this respect. A word, a glance, a movement, a dropped stone, the flashing of a mirror reveals the intentions of the faithless one to her lover, without the neighborhood noticing anything. Even the harmless smoking is used in reaching an understanding. The woman rubs the tip of the cigarette with some aromatic oil and hands it to the man she desires to win. He immediately tastes the oil and knows what the woman wants of him. Thus, there are innumerable ways of reaching an understanding between those who have bad intentions. This refined system of adultery is not surprising, however, in the case of a people among whom Inemes, the goddess of lechery, swings her scepter.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_504_FmTrukL]  Writing in the colonial period, Gladwin claims that children conceived through adultery were integrated into matrilineal kin groups without much consternation: 'Another aspect of kinship deserves mention. As we have seen this is a matrilineal society, which means that the social placement of a child in the lineage and wider social groupings depends in most respects upon his tie with his mother. The Trukese take this quite literally and therefore pay little or no attention to who may [Page 51] be the child’s actual biological father, even though this may be perfectly obvious. While the unmarried mother may find herself in a somewhat embarrassing social position, as far as can be determined no stigma whatsoever attaches to the child. Children of adulterous unions similarly are simply considered to be the children of the man to whom their mother was married at the time of their birth. Perhaps most important of the problems resolved by this device is that of children fathered by foreigners. At the present time there are literally hundreds of children whose appearance unmistakably shows them to have had Japanese fathers, and who in another society could readily form a class of half-breeds or mestizos with highly disruptive effects for themselves and the society as a whole. But on Truk they are simply Trukese children, treated no differently from any others, and properly furnished with mothers and fathers. Those who have seen the deep cleavage formed in societies elsewhere by mestizo groups can readily appreciate the degree of the good fortune of the Trukese in this regard. There are a few true half-castes on Truk, descendents of early traders who married Trukese women and raised their children themselves; these people consider themselves half-castes and are treated as such. But because this limited group can expand only slightly, not being augmented by further foreign transgressions, they can have little harmful effect and, in fact, have used the business knowledge passed down to them from their fathers or grandfathers to make major contributions to the economic adjustment of Truk under American administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_505_FmTrukL] It is difficult to quantify a 'typical number of extramarital partners' from these descriptions. It is also difficult to determine whether high-status men had more sexual partners than others.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Legal rights are different on the basis of:</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Gender ♣ present ♥</b> 'Chuukese followed a gendered division of labour: 'Traditionally, men gardened, cooked and processed food in bulk (in the earth oven), did deep-water fishing, engaged in war and public affairs, and practiced the arts of canoe and house building and of wood, shell, and stone working. Women wove, plaited mats, prepared meals (as distinct from food in bulk), did inshore fishing, and took main responsibility for child care. Men and women have both entered into school teaching, clerical work, and administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_506_FmTrukL] Women were excluded from some ceremonial activities due to gendered ritual taboos: 'A few dances are also connected with the worship of the spirits. These are the dugia (dance with kurukur, that is, staffs of orange wood) and the älimod, a dance which is performed in a sitting position. The former is a men’s dance; the latter may be performed by both sexes. During the entire dancing period the dancers are shut up in the udd. This is surrounded by a fence which no unbidden person, especially no woman, may approach. No indecent word occurs in these spirit dances, in contrast to the other dances. They say that the spirits do not like indecent things in connection with the men, a statement which does not correspond with their views on other occasions.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_507_FmTrukL] 'The pue is handled in different ways. The most important and solemn pue is the girot. The soupue makes the girot in the udd in the /66/ presence of his pupils. Women are not allowed to watch. As a matter of fact no woman is allowed to make any kind of pue.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_508_FmTrukL] 'After the apu[unknown]etou, the canoe, which is called faremai (= önumai) if it is a rowing canoe, is tested. It goes out on the sea for the kitir (rowing or sailing race). No woman is allowed to board the faremai, and no food may be put in it. The food must go with the other canoes. In the center of the new canoe sits the souatomai, who caresses the canoe and invokes the spirits. Having reached water favorable for navigation, the crew starts to row, and the vessels shoot across the broad surface with the speed of arrows. The invocations of the suatomai become more and more animated; the iéfot, iéfot of the rowers, wilder and wilder. Strange /74/ canoes passing by must be careful about coming too close to the faremai, for it is sacred.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_509_FmTrukL] Men in turn were excluded from some female-gendered activities, such as childbirth: 'It is not so simple for a child to be born on Truk. One can call it a near miracle if a child escapes all who struggle for its life before and after birth. The woman in childbirth is separated from the other occupants of the house. She often occupies a little house built especially for the birth. One or another older woman from among the relatives, called soufam or souetikar (midwives), is to be found with her. Entrance is forbidden to all men.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_510_FmTrukL] According to Caughey, lineage leaders were usually male and brothers had authority over sisters: 'A lineage is conceived of as a group of siblings ( pwiipwi). In a group of real siblings, males have authority over females and the “eldest brother” ( mwaaniichi) is the leader. Within the lineage, the oldest male of the oldest generation is usually the “lineage leader” ( mmwen noon eterekes, [Page 65] “first inside of the lineage”).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_511_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, brothers were owed respect by sisters: 'As long as the children are small, they run around completely naked. When they become bigger and approach maturity, the boys receive their akadöwar (modesty band), the girls their atok (hip mat). From the day when the boy has his band he is considered a youth. The sister, when meeting him, must aporo, that is, bow. An old custom to indicate the age of a boy is connected with this modesty band. To the question, “How old is the boy?” comes the answer, for example, “ etö efärin” (= akadöwar), that is, a modesty band, which means that he has grown beyond the age of a boy. The natives do not have any precise estimate of their age. None of them is able [Page 99] to say how old he is with any exactness. To designate the stages of age, they have mönukol (1) 1 Literally: the conceived. , sediben (2) 2 “It has no will.” semirid (3) 3 “It cannot think.”  = child, that is, very small children. For somewhat bigger ones, the expressions äd, säri (boy), le[unknown]in (girl) are used; at maturity, whether married or not, öluöl (youth), fabul (young woman). Adult persons are called muan (man), fefin (woman).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_512_FmTrukL] However, women could hold property even without the husband's consent (Chuukese lineages were matrilineal): 'The position of the Truk woman in legal respects is not degrading. They are not weakly in the hands of the husband. I have seen men who were terribly henpecked. The women have their property, are able to acquire, buy, and sell without the husband’s consent. The children also belong exclusively to them. They have little work and for the most part are treated well, even if only to prevent them from running away. It is considered wrong to beat women.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_513_FmTrukL] We are unsure whether the above examples constitute differences in 'legal rights', but have assumed so for the time being.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Social class ♣ present ♥</b> As a clan-based society, the Chuukese were stratified according to lineage rather than social class: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_514_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_515_FmTrukL] Chiefly status was tied to lineages in full ownership of territorial districts: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_516_FmTrukL] Male chiefs were attached to the senior lineages of matrilineal descent groups: 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_517_FmTrukL] Bollig claims that members of chiefly lineages received preferential treatment in judicial matters due to nepotism: 'Another weak point of the chiefs is partiality. Members of the chief’s kin group, blood relatives, and friends are not readily punished, not even for serious crimes. On the other hand, poor devils whom the chief cannot bear are sentenced to hard labor for the slightest reason or are reported to the government as “disobedient ones” or “rebels.” In the old days the Truk chiefs did away with troublesome persons by means of the knife; today they do it by means of lies and false denunciations.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_518_FmTrukL] Socioeconomic stratification along class lines emerged in the colonial period: 'Substantial differences in monetary and material wealth exist among Peniyesene’s population, as evidenced in everything from housing to transportation to clothing and diet. Some residents are, by Micronesian standards, rich; others are abysmally poor. Considerable evidence exists that these differences in wealth are giving rise to emergent social classes. Some residents of Peniyesene own two cars and live in new cement homes with linoleum floors, glass louvred windows, kerosene refrigerators or freezers, western-style furniture, and electricity (from small diesel generators), which is used to run electric lights, fans, and, in at least one case, a washing machine. These same wealthy families operate one or two motorboats equipped with 25 horsepower Johnson or Evinrude outboard engines, dress in stylish clothing, purchase fancy toys for their children, and [Page 29] [Page 30] diaper their babies with disposable diapers. Family meals regularly include frozen Australian beef, chicken from the United States, and such delicacies as cinnamon rolls flown in fresh on Air Mike from Tommy’s Bakery on Guam.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_519_FmTrukL] 'At the other end of the village economic scale, several large families have no member employed for wages and continue to subsist on a traditional Trukese diet of breadfruit, taro, and fresh fish, supplemented by small amounts of imported food, such as rice and flour. Their minimal monetary resources derive from the sale of copra to the TTC or from occasional part-time labor for wealthier members of the community. They own neither car nor motorboat and are lucky to own a canoe. Their homes are either single-room plywood boxes or small structures made piecemeal from corrugated tin, old packing crates, and random pieces of lumber. Their clothing is old and tattered and their children have no fine toys with which to amuse themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_520_FmTrukL] 'These large differences in wealth and life-style are galling to many Trukese who hold egalitarianism as a fundamental ethic; the drunken behavior of many young men in the community is not unrelated to perceived class differences. Several of the wealthier individuals in Peniyesene keep.22 caliber rifles to deal with persons who might try to break into their homes at night.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_521_FmTrukL] Ethnic and class hierarchies intersected to an extent, with Chuukese of part-Japanese descent often belonging to an emergent elite: 'Some of today’s elite are part Japanese, the progeny and descendants of unions between Trukese women and Japanese men in an era when few Japanese women lived in the islands. Truk’s elite, as with elites in developing countries elsewhere in the world, have more money, material possessions, and sophistication than their compatriots, largely because they have had greater access to education—particularly higher education—and wage employment, opportunities that have been passed along to their children in most cases. A considerable number of elite families on Moen own two cars, one of which they operate as a taxi to generate extra family income. On a good day a taxi driver can earn $75-$100 on Moen at a set fare of 25 cents/ride (50 cents to the outermost villages).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_522_FmTrukL] Access to schooling was distributed unequally in the post-colonial period: 'Many elite couples on Moen in 1985 enrolled their children in one of the church-run private schools because they could afford the tuition and [Page 23] because the students were believed to get a better education there, particularly in mastery of the English language. Education, employment, financial capital, and travel experiences all have equipped elites for leadership positions in the modern political system, bringing their power and prestige full circle. Those Trukese aspiring to elite status harbor dreams and ambitions not unlike those of upwardly mobile young Americans. They want a piece of land on Moen on which to build a nice house and enough money to afford a car. The port town’s rapid growth from immigration has fueled land speculation, and today a small plot on which to build a home may sell for several thousand dollars.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_523_FmTrukL]  However, Marshall writes that kinship remained important: 'We have some misgivings about using class labels derived from the American system to describe Trukese society, and we are convinced that a class analysis by itself cannot explain the reality of modern Trukese social organization. For Truk remains a society organized primarily and fundamentally along kinship lines, and the lineages and clans still serve as the [Page 22] basis for the social structure, whether in the realm of politics or of economics. What we label “incipient social classes” overlay and crosscut the undergirding kinship structure in significant ways, and failing to discuss these emergent differences would produce an inaccurate picture of life in the islands today. A recognition of nascent social classes in Truk is also essential to an understanding of women’s involvement in the prohibition movement over the past decade. In Truk, as in the United States a century ago, middle-class women provided the leadership and the energy to launch and sustain prohibition (see Chapter Seven).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_524_FmTrukL] We are unsure whether the above examples constitute different 'legal rights' stratified according to 'social class', but have assumed so for the time being, given the differential treatment of elites and commoners in judicial matters handled by chiefs. This remains in need of further confirmation.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ethnicity or race ♣ absent ♥</b> Writing in the colonial period, Gladwin claims that 'mixed-race' individuals were readily integrated into matrilineal kin groups: 'Another aspect of kinship deserves mention.

At the present time there are literally hundreds of children whose appearance unmistakably shows them to have had Japanese fathers, and who in another society could readily form a class of half-breeds or mestizos with highly disruptive effects for themselves and the society as a whole. But on Truk they are simply Trukese children, treated no differently from any others, and properly furnished with mothers and fathers. Those who have seen the deep cleavage formed in societies elsewhere by mestizo groups can readily appreciate the degree of the good fortune of the Trukese in this regard. There are a few true half-castes on Truk, descendents of early traders who married Trukese women and raised their children themselves; these people consider themselves half-castes and are treated as such. But because this limited group can expand only slightly, not being augmented by further foreign transgressions, they can have little harmful effect and, in fact, have used the business knowledge passed down to them from their fathers or grandfathers to make major contributions to the economic adjustment of Truk under American administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_525_FmTrukL] We have found no evidence of discrimination against mixed-race individuals within Chuuk communities. Ethnic and class hierarchies intersected to an extent, with Chuukese of part-Japanese descent often belonging to an emergent elite: 'Some of today’s elite are part Japanese, the progeny and descendants of unions between Trukese women and Japanese men in an era when few Japanese women lived in the islands. Truk’s elite, as with elites in developing countries elsewhere in the world, have more money, material possessions, and sophistication than their compatriots, largely because they have had greater access to education—particularly higher education—and wage employment, opportunities that have been passed along to their children in most cases. A considerable number of elite families on Moen own two cars, one of which they operate as a taxi to generate extra family income. On a good day a taxi driver can earn $75-$100 on Moen at a set fare of 25 cents/ride (50 cents to the outermost villages).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_526_FmTrukL] Accordingly, Chuukese communities became incorporated into a colonial ethnic hierarchy, even though their own society was not ethnically stratified.

Grantors and grantees could be either individuals or corporations. Full rights went to the survivor on the death or extinction of the other.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_533_FmTrukL] 'Individually-owned property was inherited by the owner's children. Corporately-owned property was inherited by the corporation's 'children' (the children of its men) when the corporation's membership died out.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_534_FmTrukL] Women commonly held property, but husbands and children retained usufruct rights over the property of mothers and wives: 'The position of the Truk woman in legal respects is not degrading. They are not weakly in the hands of the husband. I have seen men who were terribly henpecked. The women have their property, are able to acquire, buy, and sell without the husband’s consent. The children also belong exclusively to them. They have little work and for the most part are treated well, even if only to prevent them from running away. It is considered wrong to beat women.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_535_FmTrukL] 'The right to private property exists among the Truk natives. Everyone of them, be it man or woman, adult or child, can own property, for example, land, houses, cattle, money, etc. Whatever the wife brings into the marriage remains wholly at her disposal.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_536_FmTrukL] 'The husband and children, however, do have usufruct rights to her property. If she goes back to her family because of death or divorce, then she takes her property with her again. In practice a certain communism prevails, since siblings, members of the same kin group, often live together and cultivate their lands and enjoy the fruits together. This, however, lasts only as long as there are no quarrels among the families.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_FmTrukL] However, elder brothers usually held supervision rights over property owned by the sib: 'In contrast to this indirectly communistic property, there is also that which is directly communistic, for example, land. They call it fanu uon ar puipui, land of their brotherhood. Yet the oldest brother plays a special part in connection with all the property. He not only has the supervision and usufruct right to the property of the younger siblings, which goes back to the common [Page 132] father, but he can also withdraw it from them. Since this not infrequently happens, the oldest is usually also the richest in each family. /121/ The oldest has no rights over the property which the younger ones have obtained from other sources. To make up for the fact that the oldest has such extensive rights, he has the obligation to care for his siblings in certain ways.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_538_FmTrukL] The differentiation between individual and communal property and the practice of matriliny affected the transmission of property by men and women: 'If a man dies, the lands which belonged to him personally pass on to his children. Such land is called fanuei me uon semei, my land from my father. The particulars of the distribution are left completely to his discretion. He can also exclude one child or another, as he likes. The lands that he has jointly with his brothers, however, are taken by them. It frequently happens that the brothers, in case the children are minors, take all the lands in order to administer them, whereby one piece or another remains in their hands forever. In general the father considers only the children from the present marriage. Children from former marriages, who live with the mother’s relatives, are not considered. For that they would have had to rejoin him again later. The mother’s property too only in part passes to the children, since her brothers and sisters likewise do not want to come out short.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_567_FmTrukL] Rights in land itself were differentiated from rights in plantings: 'The Truk people are familiar with a distinction of the ground from what is planted on it. Thus, somebody may possess a piece of land, but the trees that stand on it belong to other people. They or their parents once planted the trees on his property, which is permissible according to Truk customs. If the owners of the trees are dishonest, they need only clear the field beginning from the trees, continue to cultivate, and the poor owner is dispossessed. What confused situations that causes in the case of an eventual transfer of the piece of land to another is easily understandable. I myself have had difficulties for years, since certain people still held on to “their” trees after the piece of land had long been the property of the mission. Only the felling of the trees put an end to all claims.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_568_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, land disputes were common: 'The land rights of the Truk people are not based on justice, but on the right of the stronger, the cleverer. There is hardly a plot of land with a clear legal history, and for that reason there are the constant assertions of legal claims, the eternal lawsuits over land. The boldest and most cunning persons always have the best land on Truk. Pretenses for bringing legal claims to foreign property before the chief are easily found in the confused conditions. And once they are found, the Kanakas’ inexhaustible power of invention and art of lying take care of making them convincing to others. That briberies of chiefs, interpreters, and witnesses play a tremendous part in this is obvious, considering the character of the Truk people. No means is too wicked for them in order to “profit. ”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_569_FmTrukL] Bollig attributes this issue to land exchanges and vague boundaries: 'A source of land disputes is the exchange of lands. For example: Soni and Soledon exchange two pieces of land. Soni now cultivates his land, while Soledon lets it lie fallow. Soledon dies. His children, who are not on good terms with Soni, cancel the exchange and take possession of the productive piece of land as property of their deceased father. Soni resists. The parties quarrel for years. Sometimes the one wins, sometimes the other, but no one yields.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_570_FmTrukL] 'The boundaries of the lands are very vague. They change continually under the hands of both neighbors. Sometimes the one, sometimes the other one, goes beyond them. Then they quarrel. What A has planted B tears out, with the argument that it is already on his territory. What B has planted A tears out, with the same argument. Now which of the two is right?' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_571_FmTrukL] 'With such uncertain legal conditions it is not at all surprising that quarrels over land are daily events on Truk. Every death, every divorce, every new marriage has a coil of rats’ tails in quarrels as a result. The boundless egotism of the Truk natives is responsible for all this. Everybody wants to have as much as possible. A Trukese can quarrel for years about a tree, a plant, or a foot of land, even though he has plenty of trees that are not producing anything because of lack of care. The German government gave the natives land documents on which the owner, along with all his pieces of land, was recorded. /123/ The hopes placed on this have not been fulfilled. Today everything is as confused as before.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_572_FmTrukL] It is unclear whether these disputes were endemic even before colonization or a consequence thereof. Bollig also describes strategies for claiming and asserting rights over land and plantings:  'The natives try to document their right of ownership to pieces of land by clearing something on it from time to time, or they build huts on the individual pieces of land, which they then inhabit temporarily. Dying fathers give their children directions to bury them on their pieces of land so that their grave might thus be proof of ownership for the future. One can often hear in the kobu[unknown] that this is precisely what the people refer to.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_573_FmTrukL] 'The riri, that is, to bind, forms a strange title deed on the Truk Islands. For example, somebody sees a tree which bears many fruits. Since he would like some too, he takes the ubud of a coconut palm and wraps it around a branch of the tree in order to make his intention known publicly. In many cases the owner resists such oppression and tears off the ubud. But also in many cases he keeps quiet in order to avoid bigger quarrels.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_574_FmTrukL] 'I myself have had experiences with the riri in that the girls “bound” pineapples for themselves on my plot of land, which I did not allow, of course. The riri is also done in connection with animals, only by words here, of course. They say, for example: “ A riri lon lelugei enan tugo, it is bound in my heart, this chicken, ” that is, it is my property. Then they also further take the wor d riri with a moral obligation. One says, for example: [Page 135] “U a riri uon enan a[unknown]a[unknown], I am bound to that work, ” that is, I am obliged to do it. In any case the former riri is the root of the latter.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_575_FmTrukL] A wide variety of goods could be transferred through barter: 'The acquisition of property on Truk is usually done by means of barter. Lands, houses, and canoes are bartered. Smaller units of exchange are sebi (wooden bowls), deig (curcuma), faupar (red shell disks), hip mats, modesty bands, fishing nets, aromatic oils, coconut cord, home-grown tobacco, and sleeping mats. These products of native industry are not present in like quantity or in like quality on all the islands. Thus, Sapesis on Fefan is famous for its fine bowls, Pol for curcuma and oils, Iluk for its fine hip mats.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_576_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, flexible and vague property arrangements among the Chuukese impacted the management of colonial-era plantings: 'A few decades ago the sandy shore was wilderness. Only gradually, under the influence of Europeans, were coconuts planted,for only this kind of cultivation is possible in the sand. Regular, clean grounds, however, are not to the taste of the Truk people. Coconut trees, breadfruit trees, and forest trees stand higgledy-piggledy, usually so densely that some of them never bear. The confused legal conditions of the natives are shown most glaringly on the shore. Thirty trees, which stand side by side, belong to several owners, for example: coconut tree No. 1 [Page 157] belongs to A, Nos. 2 and 3 to B, No. 4 to A again, etc. One can imagine how many quarrels about the falling fruit result from that.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_577_FmTrukL] Socioeconomic stratification along the lines of social class emerged in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'Substantial differences in monetary and material wealth exist among Peniyesene’s population, as evidenced in everything from housing to transportation to clothing and diet. Some residents are, by Micronesian standards, rich; others are abysmally poor. Considerable evidence exists that these differences in wealth are giving rise to emergent social classes. Some residents of Peniyesene own two cars and live in new cement homes with linoleum floors, glass louvred windows, kerosene refrigerators or freezers, western-style furniture, and electricity (from small diesel generators), which is used to run electric lights, fans, and, in at least one case, a washing machine. These same wealthy families operate one or two motorboats equipped with 25 horsepower Johnson or Evinrude outboard engines, dress in stylish clothing, purchase fancy toys for their children, and [Page 29] [Page 30] diaper their babies with disposable diapers. Family meals regularly include frozen Australian beef, chicken from the United States, and such delicacies as cinnamon rolls flown in fresh on Air Mike from Tommy’s Bakery on Guam.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_578_FmTrukL] 'At the other end of the village economic scale, several large families have no member employed for wages and continue to subsist on a traditional Trukese diet of breadfruit, taro, and fresh fish, supplemented by small amounts of imported food, such as rice and flour. Their minimal monetary resources derive from the sale of copra to the TTC or from occasional part-time labor for wealthier members of the community. They own neither car nor motorboat and are lucky to own a canoe. Their homes are either single-room plywood boxes or small structures made piecemeal from corrugated tin, old packing crates, and random pieces of lumber. Their clothing is old and tattered and their children have no fine toys with which to amuse themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_579_FmTrukL] 'These large differences in wealth and life-style are galling to many Trukese who hold egalitarianism as a fundamental ethic; the drunken behavior of many young men in the community is not unrelated to perceived class differences. Several of the wealthier individuals in Peniyesene keep.22 caliber rifles to deal with persons who might try to break into their homes at night.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_580_FmTrukL] Ethnic and economic hierarchies overlapped to an extent, with Chuukese of part-Japanese descent generally being among the emergent elite: 'Some of today’s elite are part Japanese, the progeny and descendants of unions between Trukese women and Japanese men in an era when few Japanese women lived in the islands. Truk’s elite, as with elites in developing countries elsewhere in the world, have more money, material possessions, and sophistication than their compatriots, largely because they have had greater access to education—particularly higher education—and wage employment, opportunities that have been passed along to their children in most cases. A considerable number of elite families on Moen own two cars, one of which they operate as a taxi to generate extra family income. On a good day a taxi driver can earn $75-$100 on Moen at a set fare of 25 cents/ride (50 cents to the outermost villages).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_581_FmTrukL] 'Many elite couples on Moen in 1985 enrolled their children in one of the church-run private schools because they could afford the tuition and [Page 23] because the students were believed to get a better education there, particularly in mastery of the English language. Education, employment, financial capital, and travel experiences all have equipped elites for leadership positions in the modern political system, bringing their power and prestige full circle. Those Trukese aspiring to elite status harbor dreams and ambitions not unlike those of upwardly mobile young Americans. They want a piece of land on Moen on which to build a nice house and enough money to afford a car. The port town’s rapid growth from immigration has fueled land speculation, and today a small plot on which to build a home may sell for several thousand dollars.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_582_FmTrukL] According to Marshall, kinship nevertheless remained important: 'We have some misgivings about using class labels derived from the American system to describe Trukese society, and we are convinced that a class analysis by itself cannot explain the reality of modern Trukese social organization. For Truk remains a society organized primarily and fundamentally along kinship lines, and the lineages and clans still serve as the [Page 22] basis for the social structure, whether in the realm of politics or of economics. What we label “incipient social classes” overlay and crosscut the undergirding kinship structure in significant ways, and failing to discuss these emergent differences would produce an inaccurate picture of life in the islands today. A recognition of nascent social classes in Truk is also essential to an understanding of women’s involvement in the prohibition movement over the past decade. In Truk, as in the United States a century ago, middle-class women provided the leadership and the energy to launch and sustain prohibition (see Chapter Seven).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_583_FmTrukL] The above examples demonstrate that while property was unevenly distributed, members of all social classes could own property in principle.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Discrimination on the basis of ethnicity/race</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bureaucratic positions are open to people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ present ♥</b> According to Gladwin, children of mixed-race descent were readily integrated into matrilineal kin groups: 'Another aspect of kinship deserves mention.

Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_599_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_600_FmTrukL] Chiefly lineages owned land associated with their territorial district: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_601_FmTrukL]  Chiefs generally hailed from senior lineages and relied on the support of male kin: 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.'

A considerable number of elite families on Moen own two cars, one of which they operate as a taxi to generate extra family income. On a good day a taxi driver can earn $75-$100 on Moen at a set fare of 25 cents/ride (50 cents to the outermost villages).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_606_FmTrukL] Kinship nevertheless remained important: 'We have some misgivings about using class labels derived from the American system to describe Trukese society, and we are convinced that a class analysis by itself cannot explain the reality of modern Trukese social organization.

A recognition of nascent social classes in Truk is also essential to an understanding of women’s involvement in the prohibition movement over the past decade. In Truk, as in the United States a century ago, middle-class women provided the leadership and the energy to launch and sustain prohibition (see Chapter Seven).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_607_FmTrukL] According to Fischer, chiefs were elected during the colonial period: 'As has been previously suggested, their is some evidence that the direction of change in the Trukese system is toward a more individualistic society. This is shown in the change to election rather than the inheritance of the office of chief, a change which though at most superficial tends to upset to some extent the traditional authority of the chief and to leave him with less respect and power. It is also shown in the increased prestige of individuals, who would not have been endowed with prestige under the traditional system, but who now manage to acquire it through the making of money or the accumulation of pisek.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_608_FmTrukL] 'Romonum: Specifically, Romonum, with a population of about 250, is divided into two districts, Winisi and Chorong.

As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_610_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_611_FmTrukL] Chiefly lineages owned land associated with their territorial district: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights.

Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_612_FmTrukL] Chiefs generally hailed from senior lineages and relied on the support of male kin: 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_613_FmTrukL] However, it appears that the differentiation between chiefly and commoner lineages did not amount to a formal caste system: 'There was little clothing differentiation according to status. Chiefs and men of wealth wore somewhat more richly ornamented garments, but these statuses were not associated with special items of clothing. This privilege was reserved for the specialist in native lore (itang) and for the breadfruit summoner, souattomei. On those occasions when the itang talked to the people in the meeting house, he wore a special cloak (nite), woven from banana fibers along the same pattern as the ordinary man’s cloak, pinu; at these times also, he was the only person allowed to wear the conical pandanus hat, saaim. The souattomei possessed a special loincloth (meciijenimei) which [Page 323] he wore during the model canoe races connected with the breadfruit summoning ceremonies, and also at the feast signalling the end of these ceremonies.'

There are some who number scarcely 10 and some who count 100 to 200 members. The most varied kin-groups live together in such a tribe. Thus, the tribe of the Sabu people on the island of Iluk, amounting to about 120 persons, includes members of the kin groups Witö, Atau, Soborelo[unknown], Ipä[unknown]es, Sobu, [Page 124] and Fesinim, some of whom came into the tribe through adoption and some through marriage. The members of a tribe usually live together in irregularly laid out, small communities. Only a few live in the mountains by themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_632_FmTrukL] Chiefs were members of senior lineages: 'Each tribe has its chief ( somol ki), often even two or three. The chiefs, as a rule, are taken from the kin group which was the dominant one from the beginning and perhaps first settled on the land concerned. Thus, on Uman the Fesinim kin group rules; on Poloas, Immo; and on Fefan, Soufar. The Pue kin group rose in this island and occupies many a chief’s seat. Atau governs on Faituk, Sepelo on Udot, after Ipä[unknown]es perished in the wars, and Sapulupi on Wöla. In all there might be 400 to 500 chiefs. If one considers that the total population of the Truk lagoon hardly amounts to 12,000 people, the number of chiefs must be designated as unnaturally large. In spite of the fact that one such chief has a small area with few people under him, compactness and co-operation are missing. Although the chief proudly calls himself awen fanu, mouth of the land, lugen fanu, heart of the land, or säli[unknown]en fanu, ear of the land, he generally has little to say. Only some one or other understands how to keep his people together, because he knows how to gain influence as a result of previous warlike deeds or personal cunning and lack of consideration. In addition to this, several who live in his territory come from other tribes, pay tribute to their homeland chief, and do not concern themselves about him.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_633_FmTrukL] They were traditionally succeeded by brothers and brothers' sons: 'There is always provision for a successor for a deceased chief. The children are not qualified to inherit, but eo ipso his brothers, and, to be sure, according to age. If there are no longer any brothers, then come the children of the brothers. It is said of somebody who has improperly become chief that he is not popun somol ( popun = tribe), that is, legitimate chief.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_634_FmTrukL] 'When a chief becomes old and weak, he usually has a younger person at his side who performs the more difficult tasks. The old chief is then called somobun mo[unknown]ö, chief of the food, because the first fruits are still delivered to him. The young chief, who has the right of succession, receives the title somobun kabas, chief of speech.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_637_FmTrukL] We are unsure as to the background of these newley elected chiefs. They may have belonged to an emergent upper class: 'A significant development on Moen in the last two decades is the rise of a monied elite in a formerly egalitarian society with no traditional class differences. Social class has now become a significant feature of contemporary Trukese life, although it is not formally labeled in the Trukese language. Other than a few extremely wealthy upper-class families, town dwellers sort into middle class and lower class on the bases of education, wage employment, and traditional kinship affiliation. Thus, we refer to upper-class and middle-class persons collectively as the elite. By rough approximation about 500 adults on Moen in 1985 made up the elite. Typically, citizens in this category had at least a high-school education (and usually more); a household income of at least $10,000; ties by kinship, marriage, or adoption to a traditional chiefly lineage (or similar ties to senior public servants or high-ranking politicians in the new political system); an important church position (e.g., lay minister, Fin Anisi leader); and significant material assets on Moen in land and personal property (businesses, vehicles, homes, etc.). In most cases, both spouses in elite married couples were employed for wages in government or private enterprise.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_638_FmTrukL] This remains in need of confirmation.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_643_FmTrukL] However, in the colonial period chiefs were elected: 'As has been previously suggested, their is some evidence that the direction of change in the Trukese system is toward a more individualistic society. This is shown in the change to election rather than the inheritance of the office of chief, a change which though at most superficial tends to upset to some extent the traditional authority of the chief and to leave him with less respect and power. It is also shown in the increased prestige of individuals, who would not have been endowed with prestige under the traditional system, but who now manage to acquire it through the making of money or the accumulation of pisek.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_644_FmTrukL] 'Romonum: Specifically, Romonum, with a population of about 250, is divided into two districts, Winisi and Chorong. A few years ago the island was ruled by two district chiefs, with higher authority resting in a chief of Utot, a large nearby island. Today, Romonum has one elected chief, Wanter, and he is the leading citizen of the island. However, the real boss of Romonum is a half-breed Trukese-Chinese, S&amp;ounknown;&amp;ounknown;n, who is the brother of the richest man in Truk, owns the only store on Romonum, and through his brother keeps control of a large pompom and another fairly large boat which has an American motor and is the fastest in the lagoon. S&amp;ounknown;&amp;ounknown;n’s house is also the finest on the island, and is located at the foot of an excellent pier built by the Japanese. From this pier in the district of Chorong a path lined with banana trees leads off toward Winisi along the sandy shelf. Most of the houses of the inhabitants are located along this path.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_645_FmTrukL] However, we are unsure as to how much real social mobility this implied. Elected chiefs may have been members of an emergent elite which in turn had ties to traditional chiefly lineages: 'A significant development on Moen in the last two decades is the rise of a monied elite in a formerly egalitarian society with no traditional class differences. Social class has now become a significant feature of contemporary Trukese life, although it is not formally labeled in the Trukese language. Other than a few extremely wealthy upper-class families, town dwellers sort into middle class and lower class on the bases of education, wage employment, and traditional kinship affiliation. Thus, we refer to upper-class and middle-class persons collectively as the elite. By rough approximation about 500 adults on Moen in 1985 made up the elite. Typically, citizens in this category had at least a high-school education (and usually more); a household income of at least $10,000; ties by kinship, marriage, or adoption to a traditional chiefly lineage (or similar ties to senior public servants or high-ranking politicians in the new political system); an important church position (e.g., lay minister, Fin Anisi leader); and significant material assets on Moen in land and personal property (businesses, vehicles, homes, etc.). In most cases, both spouses in elite married couples were employed for wages in government or private enterprise.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_646_FmTrukL] But we have found no evidence of 'extreme' status elevation. We are also unsure when precisely this process started.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ extreme status diminution ♣ absent ♥</b> Socioeconomic differentiation along class lines emerged in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'Substantial differences in monetary and material wealth exist among Peniyesene’s population, as evidenced in everything from housing to transportation to clothing and diet. Some residents are, by Micronesian standards, rich; others are abysmally poor. Considerable evidence exists that these differences in wealth are giving rise to emergent social classes. Some residents of Peniyesene own two cars and live in new cement homes with linoleum floors, glass louvred windows, kerosene refrigerators or freezers, western-style furniture, and electricity (from small diesel generators), which is used to run electric lights, fans, and, in at least one case, a washing machine. These same wealthy families operate one or two motorboats equipped with 25 horsepower Johnson or Evinrude outboard engines, dress in stylish clothing, purchase fancy toys for their children, and [Page 29] [Page 30] diaper their babies with disposable diapers. Family meals regularly include frozen Australian beef, chicken from the United States, and such delicacies as cinnamon rolls flown in fresh on Air Mike from Tommy’s Bakery on Guam.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_647_FmTrukL] 'At the other end of the village economic scale, several large families have no member employed for wages and continue to subsist on a traditional Trukese diet of breadfruit, taro, and fresh fish, supplemented by small amounts of imported food, such as rice and flour. Their minimal monetary resources derive from the sale of copra to the TTC or from occasional part-time labor for wealthier members of the community. They own neither car nor motorboat and are lucky to own a canoe. Their homes are either single-room plywood boxes or small structures made piecemeal from corrugated tin, old packing crates, and random pieces of lumber. Their clothing is old and tattered and their children have no fine toys with which to amuse themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_648_FmTrukL] 'These large differences in wealth and life-style are galling to many Trukese who hold egalitarianism as a fundamental ethic; the drunken behavior of many young men in the community is not unrelated to perceived class differences. Several of the wealthier individuals in Peniyesene keep.22 caliber rifles to deal with persons who might try to break into their homes at night.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_649_FmTrukL] Ethnic and economic hierarchies overlapped somewhat, with Chuukese of part-Japanese descent generally belonging to an emergent elite: 'Some of today’s elite are part Japanese, the progeny and descendants of unions between Trukese women and Japanese men in an era when few Japanese women lived in the islands. Truk’s elite, as with elites in developing countries elsewhere in the world, have more money, material possessions, and sophistication than their compatriots, largely because they have had greater access to education—particularly higher education—and wage employment, opportunities that have been passed along to their children in most cases. A considerable number of elite families on Moen own two cars, one of which they operate as a taxi to generate extra family income. On a good day a taxi driver can earn $75-$100 on Moen at a set fare of 25 cents/ride (50 cents to the outermost villages).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_650_FmTrukL] Kinship nevertheless remained important: 'We have some misgivings about using class labels derived from the American system to describe Trukese society, and we are convinced that a class analysis by itself cannot explain the reality of modern Trukese social organization. For Truk remains a society organized primarily and fundamentally along kinship lines, and the lineages and clans still serve as the [Page 22] basis for the social structure, whether in the realm of politics or of economics. What we label “incipient social classes” overlay and crosscut the undergirding kinship structure in significant ways, and failing to discuss these emergent differences would produce an inaccurate picture of life in the islands today. A recognition of nascent social classes in Truk is also essential to an understanding of women’s involvement in the prohibition movement over the past decade. In Truk, as in the United States a century ago, middle-class women provided the leadership and the energy to launch and sustain prohibition (see Chapter Seven).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_651_FmTrukL] We have only found vague and inconclusive references to status diminution: 'If the marriage now breaks up, the children always remain eo ipso with the mother. When married persons have separated, the one who remarries first must compensate the parents and relatives of the abandoned party. This compensation ( fes) is fixed by the chiefs. It happens frequently on Truk that one marriage partner leaves the other in the lurch with the children. Marriages are broken up as thoughtlessly as they were concluded. Men and women who can boast of /95/ having had 20 to 30 marriage partners, all of whom are still alive, are not rare. But they have the not very honorable name of widom (1) 1 wi, exchange, detach; dom, domelo, to fall down, to desert., which indicates their fickleness. A marriage is even more endangered if the married persons belong to different tribes or islands. There need arise only a quarrel, and the [Page 103] young wife’s relatives immediately come to take her away and thus anger the “hostile” tribe. But I have also met on the Truk lagoon married couples who stayed together faithfully and preferred to break off with the parents on both sides rather than separate. But unfortunately such are sown very thinly, and even among them there is no guarantee that they will still feel the same the following week. Kanakas seized by passion are terrible, without any consideration, without any judgment. Fortunately, since they are as changeable as the weather, these moments too soon pass.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_652_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> Prior to colonization, the Chuukese economy was subsistence-based: 'In the past, swidden gardens with dry taro, turmeric, and sugar cane were few and small. Breadfruit, supplemented by wet taro, was the staple. Being seasonal, breadfruit was preserved by fermenting in pits. Copra has become the only export. Fishing was important.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_653_FmTrukL] 'Traditionally, men gardened, cooked and processed food in bulk (in the earth oven), did deep-water fishing, engaged in war and public affairs, and practiced the arts of canoe and house building and of wood, shell, and stone working. Women wove, plaited mats, prepared meals (as distinct from food in bulk), did inshore fishing, and took main responsibility for child care.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_654_FmTrukL] 'Traditional crafts included: making outrigger paddle canoes; building houses; woodworking (to make bowls, storage chests, spears); gardening; cordage (to make rope, string, slings); working stone (for sling stones), shell (for adz blades), and coral (for breadfruit pounders); preparing medicines; loom weaving with hibiscus and banana fibers (to make loin clothes, wraparound skirts, shirts, mosquito canopies); plaiting (of baskets, mats); and other leaf working (for thatch, sun hats). Sewing arts and dressmaking have replaced weaving.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_655_FmTrukL] Some trade schools were established in the colonial period: 'A further step on the educational ladder was eventually provided with the establishment of a trade school for carpenters at Koror, Palau, a thousand miles to the west. Promising graduates of the higher elementary schools were selected from all over the mandated territory to attend this school. Later a small agricultural school was established on Dublon Island, Truk, and, after the Japanese started to alienate “undeveloped” native land for colonization, a surveyor’s school was established in Palau.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_656_FmTrukL] Economic 'development' was interrupted during the World Wars: 'While the militarization of Truk, which was to prove a disatrously inadequate bastion for the Japanese in the second World War, changed the emphasis of Japanese [Page 45] development of the islands, it served merely to accelerate the processes of change in the Trukese society initiated earlier by the economic development program which of course continued but on a lesser scale. But with the beginning of the air strikes against Truk in 1944, and the blockade which followed, the fruits of the Japanese efforts at economic development were destroyed and the necessity of supporting some 35,000 foreigners in addition to the almost 10,000 Trukese off the land resulted in a serious depletion of their resources. Intensive cultivation of sweet potatoes made unfit for use many acres of good gardening land, and the extensive use of explosives in fishing, as well as the underwater explosion of many aerial bombs and mines, depleted the fish population to an extent which is felt to the present day. While there are still plenty of fish, they are not as numerous in any one place, and therefore harder to catch.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_657_FmTrukL] Commercial fishing was introduced in the colonial period. Goodenough's comments seem to imply that further economic diversification only emerged under American administration: 'Okinawans developed commercial fishing during Japanese rule; and some commercial fishing on a small scale was continued by the Chuukese after World War II. Under American rule, the principle source of cash income was government employment as teachers and program administrators. Tourism was unimportant.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_658_FmTrukL] 'Men and women have both entered into school teaching, clerical work, and administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_659_FmTrukL] 'New arts include motor maintenance (of cars and outboards); boat building; bookkeeping; school teaching; government administration; and nursing and medical practice.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_660_FmTrukL] We have assumed that in the colonial period, the number of native petty officials and craftsmen was very small, with most islanders remaining in subsistence horticulture. Accordingly, occupational mobility was probably low in practice.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Slavery">Slavery</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=FmTrukL&amp;action=edit&amp;section=64" title="Edit section: Slavery">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ 0% ♥</b> We have found no evidence of slavery in the colonial period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Proportion of population enserfed ♣ 0% ♥</b><b>Types</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Chattel slavery ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Elite slavery ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bonded serfdom ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Corvée labor to a landowner ♣ present ♥</b> According to Bollig, chiefs were owed first fruits: 'As a reward for his faithful activity, the chief receives the muen, that is, the first fruits from the yields of the fields and trees, for example, breadfruit, bananas, and taro. It is said that many chiefs go to the fields in order to inspect their condition so that if the occasion arises they can check the deliveries. The Truk chiefs do not have any other legal claims. Nevertheless their subjects give them assistance in their own interests. The chief usually receives the best part from festive meals and fishing. If there is fishing with mention of the name of the chief, however, he receives everything, and nobody is allowed to withhold anything. Woe to the one who in former times did not pay his tribute properly. He had no prospect of a long life. It is said of the old chiefs that they always had the blow shell beside them. When the puk, puk of the shell resounded from the chief’s house, the people knew its meaning immediately. They quickly came running in order to /117/ learn the wishes of the tyrant. At one time he would desire kon (pounded breadfruit), at another time fish, then [Page 128] bananas, then coconuts to drink. The chiefs today no longer dare commit these outrages but they still have sufficient means to obtain some things on the side. They announce a dance, for example, or hold an efilul (celebration in connection with house-building, held when the frame is erected). They certainly do not come out short at the feast connected with this. As a matter of fact, most chiefs understand very well how to entice from their people whatever they might like to have.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_661_FmTrukL] Junior lineages and provisional title holders owed food prestations to chiefs on the occasion of feasts: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_662_FmTrukL] We have assumed that this was practiced in the colonial period as well.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Corvée labor to the state ♣ ♥</b> We are unsure whether colonial authorities extracted labor services from the native population, although this cannot be ruled out.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Restraints</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Owners can execute slaves ♣ absent ♥</b> We have found no evidence of slavery in the colonial period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Owners can impose corporal punishment on slaves ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Corporal punishment by the state ♣ ♥</b><b>Human sacrifice</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Prisoners ♣ ♥</b> According to Bollig, the bodies of slain enemies were cut into pieces and eaten: 'The prisoners were usually done away with.Anyone who had a bone to pick with them cut their throats. Yet I have also heard of cases in which the prisoners were spared on please of the women and were later released. The slain enemies were cut into pieces. /106/ In the frenzy some drank their blood or cut pieces from the soft parts, roasted them, and ate them to cool their vengeance.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_663_FmTrukL] He also mentions what appears to be a form of human sacrifice: 'The spirit Paladiu on the island of Falanu is even more modest. Human excrement satisfies him as an offering. During a war human sacrifices seem to have been offered also. At least cases are known where captives had their throats cut over the graves of those who had fallen, so that the blood would be sprinkled over them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_664_FmTrukL] Bollig also claims the ritual mutilation of dead enemies: 'When the plans were ready and the preparations completed, the entire body of troops gathered opposite the enemy territory at a place which was suitable for the battle (rasen moun). Here the ida[unknown] put up the önusoso or soönu (erected spirit). This önusoso was a wooden figure which represented a human being or an animal, for example, shark, hake. In some cases a corpse itself was used. For example, such a soönu was to be found on the premises of the mission on Fautuen. It was the corpse of an enemy warrior who had been treacherously killed. It was set against a tree stump, with the face toward the country of the enemy. The face was terribly disfigured, in that the lips were cut off. The mouth stood open, prevented from closing by a spike of bone. In its hand the corpse held a spear which likewise was directed toward the enemy.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_665_FmTrukL] LeBar denies the cannibalization of enemies: 'Informants denied that slain enemies were ever eaten on Truk. A variant way of handling the dead in the old days required that the corpse be wrapped in mats and hung in the house. Relatives might show their fondness for the deceased by eating [Page 223] a bit of the flesh or drinking a few drops of the body fluids collected in a bowl beneath the corpse.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_666_FmTrukL] Expert feedback is needed on the matter. We are unsure when precisely the practice was discontinued, but this must have happened sometime during the colonial period.

They included spirit mediums, breadfruit summoners, fish summoners, healers, masters of spells, masters of sorcery, builders, navigators, diviners, and most importantly the masters of magic and ritual relating to war and politics. Their knowledge was private property passed down to their children and junior lineage mates.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_667_FmTrukL] 'Major ceremonies were those associated with death, communicating with good souls of the dead, summoning breadfruit, and making food presentations to chiefs. Ritual was also associated with divination, curing, warfare, political meetings, house building, and courtship.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_668_FmTrukL] Mediums communicated with the dead: 'In traditional belief, spirit beings were widely distributed in the sky, under the sea, and on land. The important places among spirit lands in the sky were: a region under the dome of Heaven, home of the gods who could take human form; a region in the south from which came all the plant and marine life that gave people food; and a region named 'Achaw' or 'Kachaw,' abode of the ancestors of many Chuukese clans and particularly of the clans associated with the chiefship and the special bodies of magical lore from which chiefly power derived. Spirits could accomplish their intentions at will and were thus the source of all that was MANAMAN (mana), such as efficacious spells, medicines, and rituals. Good souls of the dead were consulted through mediums. The Chuukese also invoked in spells the spirits inhabiting the dome of Heaven, presided over by 'Great Spirit,' and the spirits associated with particular crafts and major bodies of lore.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_669_FmTrukL] Diviners, Healers, and Mediums were involved in the treatment of illness: 'Sickness was believed to result from the 'bite' of a malevolent spirit, or of any other spirit one had offended or that was controlled by a ritual specialist one had offended or by a sorcerer. Sickness might also result from soul loss. In all but the latter case, treatment involved the use of medicines to be applied externally, to be drunk, or to be inhaled. For soul loss, a spirit medium was consulted to help find and restore the soul. Divination was used as a diagnostic aid in cases of severe or prolonged illness. Massage was used to treat bruises, local infections, and muscle ailments.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_670_FmTrukL] Diviners accepted payments from apprentices in exchange for secret knowledge: 'There are systems of knowledge which are subject to special rules of their own. [Page 56] For example, to learn knot divination a pupil must pay the diviner ( sowupwe) even if the latter is his own father or mother’s brother. An jitag (a sort of lawyer, general, diplomat and orator all rolled into one, who occupies the most prestigeful position in Trukese society) is alleged never to teach his own children as much as he teaches his sister’s children. This contention does not, however, appear to be supported by the genealogical connections of the past jitag of Romonum Island. Despite special rules governing specific forms of incorporeal property, their over-all organization is analogous to that of corporeal property and does not require a new conceptual framework to make them intelligible.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_671_FmTrukL] Spirit mediums were an exception to this rule, as their expertise did not rely on knowledge per se: 'All religious practitioners as well as craftsmen and magicians are owners of the knowledge necessary to exercise their specialties. The Trukese make no distinction between them and other skilled personnel. There is one important exception to this rule, the spirit medium ( wäättwa or wään ëny). His (or her) position is not based on knowledge so much as on having been possessed by a spirit. This spirit is in no way classed as the medium’s property, nor can it be inherited automatically by a son or lineage mate. The position of a spirit medium, therefore, is different from that of a property holder, except as he uses his abilities to diagnose illness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_672_FmTrukL] The Chuuk islands experienced a higher degree of regional ceremonial integration prior to the 18th century (see above under 'preceding quasi-polity'). Whatever information is available on this would have to be covered in an additional data sheet. 'By the middle of the twentieth century all of Chuuk's people were at least nominally Christian, either Protestant or Catholic, and Christianity had become the focus of religious life.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_673_FmTrukL] As a result of missionary activities, Christianity spread quickly in the 20th century: 'After 1900 Christianity became well established in most major centres in Micronesia. For the most part, traditional religions ceased being practiced in their full original form, although in Yap and some atolls of the central Carolines, traditional religion continued to be practiced until the middle of the 20th century. Missionaries and travelers recorded descriptions of certain aspects of the island religions, but there is no complete and systematic account.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_674_FmTrukL] 'The main island is Toloas. On it lie: the government station (Witetun), the main station of the Catholic ( O[unknown]omenau) and of the Protestant ( Kutua) missions. The landmark of Poloas is the legendary mountain of Tolemuan (peak of the man). The small island of Eten, on which was to be found the seat of the Jaluit Company, is also under the head chief of Toloas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_675_FmTrukL] 'Before the Spanish Government had gained sufficient influence in the islands, the people of Truk lived under the rule of numerous petty chiefs who were constantly engaging in inter-district and inter-island warfare. In Spanish and German times, Catholic and Protestant missionaries Christianized and subdued the warlike tendencies of the population, but many of the old suspicious attitudes still show in present-day culture patterns. The numbers of Spanish and Germans who came to Truk at any one time were relatively small; they left their mark on the people in the folklore, in the religion and in the alphabet which they applied to the Trukese language, teaching the people to read and write. It was left to the Japanese to make the most impression on the native economy.'

The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_677_FmTrukL] Chiefs and their associates were also thought to control magical power: 'There were no police. A chief's brothers or sons might act on his behalf to intimidate or attack someone who had offended him. But it was control of magical power, either by the chief or one his brothers or sons, that made improper conduct liable to punishment. Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery. All such knowledge gave punitive power to chiefs and important specialists. People stressed maintaining the appearance of propriety in behavior so as not to give just cause for offense.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_678_FmTrukL] 'Although sorcery is an important cause of illness in both societies, and while Ponapean medicine appears to be vaguely similar to the Trukese system, controls in the Ponapean system do not appear to ramify throughout social relations (Reisenberg, 1948). Although illness may be interpreted as punishment for offenses against men of very high position, medical theory does not function to mediate everyday interpersonal relations to the extent that it does on Truk.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_679_FmTrukL] But while sorcery could be used for punitve purposes, it was also used for retaliation among 'commoners': 'Sorcery is a more direct if more secret form of aggression and is practically precluded from being applied within the lineage by the fact that the spells used are in each case the property of a given lineage. While it is not clear whether they would be considered effective, it is very doubtful that they would be used against others who knew them or could be expected to know them. Data on sorcery are difficult to obtain for no one admits to being a sorcerer. Those cases of afflictions (blindness, psychosis, and paralysis) which were definitely attributed to a given sorcerer always applied to someone on another island, angry because his wife had been taken away, his property trespassed upon, or the like. Although various people on Romonum were said to know certain techniques of sorcery and many people expressed a fear of being sorcerized, no one would say that a given person had actually sorcerized anyone. The detailed body of knowledge of procedures in sorcery which exists and the circumstantial accounts of how it was formerly used certainly suggest very strongly that in the past Trukese deliberately sorcerized other Trukese. Whether this is the case today, however, is an open question. In the past [Page 150] it was used by master magicians, both against rival magicians and against the laity, and was also used in the punishment of thieves; but then as now sorcery was primarily the result of one person’s animosity against another and as such acted as a sanction against acts which might antagonize another. Thus anxiety about sorcery is another factor weighing the balance in favor of conformist behavior.'

Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery.

The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_691_FmTrukL] But given the 'sacred' character of chiefs, we have decided to code 'present'.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes elites and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> As a clan-based society, the Chuukese were initially stratified according to lineages: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_692_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_693_FmTrukL] Chiefly lineages owned land associated with their territorial district: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_694_FmTrukL] Chiefs generally hailed from senior lineages and relied on the support of male kin: 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief.

More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_695_FmTrukL] However, it appears that the differentiation between chiefly and commoner lineages did not amount to a formal caste system: 'There was little clothing differentiation according to status. Chiefs and men of wealth wore somewhat more richly ornamented garments, but these statuses were not associated with special items of clothing. This privilege was reserved for the specialist in native lore (itang) and for the breadfruit summoner, souattomei. On those occasions when the itang talked to the people in the meeting house, he wore a special cloak (nite), woven from banana fibers along the same pattern as the ordinary man’s cloak, pinu; at these times also, he was the only person allowed to wear the conical pandanus hat, saaim. The souattomei possessed a special loincloth (meciijenimei) which [Page 323] he wore during the model canoe races connected with the breadfruit summoning ceremonies, and also at the feast signalling the end of these ceremonies.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_696_FmTrukL] Socioeconomic differentiation along class lines emerged in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'Substantial differences in monetary and material wealth exist among Peniyesene’s population, as evidenced in everything from housing to transportation to clothing and diet. Some residents are, by Micronesian standards, rich; others are abysmally poor. Considerable evidence exists that these differences in wealth are giving rise to emergent social classes. Some residents of Peniyesene own two cars and live in new cement homes with linoleum floors, glass louvred windows, kerosene refrigerators or freezers, western-style furniture, and electricity (from small diesel generators), which is used to run electric lights, fans, and, in at least one case, a washing machine. These same wealthy families operate one or two motorboats equipped with 25 horsepower Johnson or Evinrude outboard engines, dress in stylish clothing, purchase fancy toys for their children, and [Page 29] [Page 30] diaper their babies with disposable diapers. Family meals regularly include frozen Australian beef, chicken from the United States, and such delicacies as cinnamon rolls flown in fresh on Air Mike from Tommy’s Bakery on Guam.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_697_FmTrukL] 'At the other end of the village economic scale, several large families have no member employed for wages and continue to subsist on a traditional Trukese diet of breadfruit, taro, and fresh fish, supplemented by small amounts of imported food, such as rice and flour. Their minimal monetary resources derive from the sale of copra to the TTC or from occasional part-time labor for wealthier members of the community. They own neither car nor motorboat and are lucky to own a canoe. Their homes are either single-room plywood boxes or small structures made piecemeal from corrugated tin, old packing crates, and random pieces of lumber. Their clothing is old and tattered and their children have no fine toys with which to amuse themselves.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_698_FmTrukL] 'These large differences in wealth and life-style are galling to many Trukese who hold egalitarianism as a fundamental ethic; the drunken behavior of many young men in the community is not unrelated to perceived class differences. Several of the wealthier individuals in Peniyesene keep.22 caliber rifles to deal with persons who might try to break into their homes at night.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_699_FmTrukL] Ethnic and economic hierarchies overlapped somewhat, with Chuukese of part-Japanese descent generally belonging to an emergent elite: 'Some of today’s elite are part Japanese, the progeny and descendants of unions between Trukese women and Japanese men in an era when few Japanese women lived in the islands. Truk’s elite, as with elites in developing countries elsewhere in the world, have more money, material possessions, and sophistication than their compatriots, largely because they have had greater access to education—particularly higher education—and wage employment, opportunities that have been passed along to their children in most cases. A considerable number of elite families on Moen own two cars, one of which they operate as a taxi to generate extra family income. On a good day a taxi driver can earn $75-$100 on Moen at a set fare of 25 cents/ride (50 cents to the outermost villages).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_700_FmTrukL] Kinship nevertheless remained important: 'We have some misgivings about using class labels derived from the American system to describe Trukese society, and we are convinced that a class analysis by itself cannot explain the reality of modern Trukese social organization. For Truk remains a society organized primarily and fundamentally along kinship lines, and the lineages and clans still serve as the [Page 22] basis for the social structure, whether in the realm of politics or of economics. What we label “incipient social classes” overlay and crosscut the undergirding kinship structure in significant ways, and failing to discuss these emergent differences would produce an inaccurate picture of life in the islands today. A recognition of nascent social classes in Truk is also essential to an understanding of women’s involvement in the prohibition movement over the past decade. In Truk, as in the United States a century ago, middle-class women provided the leadership and the energy to launch and sustain prohibition (see Chapter Seven).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_701_FmTrukL] But given the distinction between 'chiefly' and 'commoner' lineages, we have decided to code 'present'.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes all ethnicities ♣ absent ♥</b> Writing in the colonial period, Gladwin claims that 'mixed-race' individuals were readily integrated into matrilineal kin groups: 'Another aspect of kinship deserves mention. As we have seen this is a matrilineal society, which means that the social placement of a child in the lineage and wider social groupings depends in most respects upon his tie with his mother. The Trukese take this quite literally and therefore pay little or no attention to who may [Page 51] be the child’s actual biological father, even though this may be perfectly obvious. While the unmarried mother may find herself in a somewhat embarrassing social position, as far as can be determined no stigma whatsoever attaches to the child. Children of adulterous unions similarly are simply considered to be the children of the man to whom their mother was married at the time of their birth. Perhaps most important of the problems resolved by this device is that of children fathered by foreigners. At the present time there are literally hundreds of children whose appearance unmistakably shows them to have had Japanese fathers, and who in another society could readily form a class of half-breeds or mestizos with highly disruptive effects for themselves and the society as a whole. But on Truk they are simply Trukese children, treated no differently from any others, and properly furnished with mothers and fathers. Those who have seen the deep cleavage formed in societies elsewhere by mestizo groups can readily appreciate the degree of the good fortune of the Trukese in this regard. There are a few true half-castes on Truk, descendents of early traders who married Trukese women and raised their children themselves; these people consider themselves half-castes and are treated as such. But because this limited group can expand only slightly, not being augmented by further foreign transgressions, they can have little harmful effect and, in fact, have used the business knowledge passed down to them from their fathers or grandfathers to make major contributions to the economic adjustment of Truk under American administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_702_FmTrukL] We have found no evidence of discrimination against mixed-race individuals within Chuuk communities. Ethnic and class hierarchies intersected to an extent, with Chuukese of part-Japanese descent often belonging to an emergent elite: 'Some of today’s elite are part Japanese, the progeny and descendants of unions between Trukese women and Japanese men in an era when few Japanese women lived in the islands. Truk’s elite, as with elites in developing countries elsewhere in the world, have more money, material possessions, and sophistication than their compatriots, largely because they have had greater access to education—particularly higher education—and wage employment, opportunities that have been passed along to their children in most cases.

On a good day a taxi driver can earn $75-$100 on Moen at a set fare of 25 cents/ride (50 cents to the outermost villages).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_703_FmTrukL] It seems that ideology did not explicitly devalue other ethnic groups, but this remains in need of confirmation.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> Chuukese followed a gendered division of labour: 'Traditionally, men gardened, cooked and processed food in bulk (in the earth oven), did deep-water fishing, engaged in war and public affairs, and practiced the arts of canoe and house building and of wood, shell, and stone working. Women wove, plaited mats, prepared meals (as distinct from food in bulk), did inshore fishing, and took main responsibility for child care. Men and women have both entered into school teaching, clerical work, and administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_704_FmTrukL] Women were excluded from some ceremonial activities due to gendered ritual taboos: 'A few dances are also connected with the worship of the spirits. These are the dugia (dance with kurukur, that is, staffs of orange wood) and the älimod, a dance which is performed in a sitting position. The former is a men’s dance; the latter may be performed by both sexes. During the entire dancing period the dancers are shut up in the udd. This is surrounded by a fence which no unbidden person, especially no woman, may approach. No indecent word occurs in these spirit dances, in contrast to the other dances. They say that the spirits do not like indecent things in connection with the men, a statement which does not correspond with their views on other occasions.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_705_FmTrukL] 'The pue is handled in different ways. The most important and solemn pue is the girot. The soupue makes the girot in the udd in the /66/ presence of his pupils. Women are not allowed to watch. As a matter of fact no woman is allowed to make any kind of pue.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_706_FmTrukL] 'After the apu[unknown]etou, the canoe, which is called faremai (= önumai) if it is a rowing canoe, is tested. It goes out on the sea for the kitir (rowing or sailing race). No woman is allowed to board the faremai, and no food may be put in it. The food must go with the other canoes. In the center of the new canoe sits the souatomai, who caresses the canoe and invokes the spirits. Having reached water favorable for navigation, the crew starts to row, and the vessels shoot across the broad surface with the speed of arrows. The invocations of the suatomai become more and more animated; the iéfot, iéfot of the rowers, wilder and wilder. Strange /74/ canoes passing by must be careful about coming too close to the faremai, for it is sacred.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_707_FmTrukL] Men in turn were excluded from some female-gendered activities, such as childbirth: 'It is not so simple for a child to be born on Truk. One can call it a near miracle if a child escapes all who struggle for its life before and after birth. The woman in childbirth is separated from the other occupants of the house. She often occupies a little house built especially for the birth. One or another older woman from among the relatives, called soufam or souetikar (midwives), is to be found with her. Entrance is forbidden to all men.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_708_FmTrukL] According to Caughey, lineage leaders were usually male and brothers had authority over sisters: 'A lineage is conceived of as a group of siblings ( pwiipwi). In a group of real siblings, males have authority over females and the “eldest brother” ( mwaaniichi) is the leader. Within the lineage, the oldest male of the oldest generation is usually the “lineage leader” ( mmwen noon eterekes, [Page 65] “first inside of the lineage”).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_709_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, brothers were owed respect by sisters: 'As long as the children are small, they run around completely naked. When they become bigger and approach maturity, the boys receive their akadöwar (modesty band), the girls their atok (hip mat). From the day when the boy has his band he is considered a youth. The sister, when meeting him, must aporo, that is, bow. An old custom to indicate the age of a boy is connected with this modesty band. To the question, “How old is the boy?” comes the answer, for example, “ etö efärin” (= akadöwar), that is, a modesty band, which means that he has grown beyond the age of a boy. The natives do not have any precise estimate of their age. None of them is able [Page 99] to say how old he is with any exactness. To designate the stages of age, they have mönukol (1) 1 Literally: the conceived. , sediben (2) 2 “It has no will.” semirid (3) 3 “It cannot think.”  = child, that is, very small children. For somewhat bigger ones, the expressions äd, säri (boy), le[unknown]in (girl) are used; at maturity, whether married or not, öluöl (youth), fabul (young woman). Adult persons are called muan (man), fefin (woman).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_710_FmTrukL] However, women could hold property even without the husband's consent (Chuukese lineages were matrilineal): 'The position of the Truk woman in legal respects is not degrading. They are not weakly in the hands of the husband. I have seen men who were terribly henpecked. The women have their property, are able to acquire, buy, and sell without the husband’s consent. The children also belong exclusively to them. They have little work and for the most part are treated well, even if only to prevent them from running away. It is considered wrong to beat women.'

Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_712_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_713_FmTrukL] According to Goodenough, levirate/sororate marriages were practiced: 'Marriage took place for women a bit before and for men a bit after the age of 20. Premarital courtship was covert and included sexual relations. Residence was usually matrilocal. Divorce, common before the birth of children, was rare thereafter. It could be initiated by either spouse and was often instigated by the wife's brothers. Levirate and sororate remarriages were valued. To keep soil and trees that had been granted to the children of a lineage's men circulating back, marriage preferences with one or another kind of cousin, varying from locality to locality, were widespread.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_714_FmTrukL] According to Bollig, polygyny was fairly widespread, partly as a result of levirate/sororate marriages: 'Polygamy (1) 1 a akaruu, he has two wives; a akaulu[unknown]at, he has three wives, etc. is very widespread on Truk. Men with two to nine wives are numerous. One becomes polygamous through the death of his brother, for out of brotherly love he has an obligation to take the widow for himself (levirate marriage). Another one marries a widow with daughters and takes the latter, as soon as they are old enough, as secondary wives. A third takes the sisters of his wife for himself, which is the case for most polygamous situations. The reasons for polygamy vary. One wants to keep landed property together by this means, or to concentrate it in his hands; another wants to have workers, since the secondary wives fish for him. Strangely enough, the motive forces for polygamy are said to be mostly the women themselves. They offer their daughters, sisters, [Page 109] and nieces to their husbands as secondary wives, in order that no strange family come in. This happens especially if they have no children, for if a strange woman comes in and gives birth to children, they will be pushed aside. They try to prevent this by means of the above measure. If polygamy has come about in this way, a peaceful life together is possible, for the women stay together in their own interests. But if the women come from different families or tribes, living together is out of the question. They live apart, and the man has the pleasant task of going back and forth. Unpleasantness and jealousy between the rivals are the order of the day. First one and then the other thinks she is being slighted. First one is tired, then the other. And the husband must always be on the move in order to keep everybody happy. Some polygamous situations which I knew were changing constantly. At one time the husband had four, then some ran away, later they increased to six, etc. A somewhat decent family life is inconceivable. The eventual /101/ children always go with the mother, but the father knows the means for drawing them to him when they are older, so that he will have a work force. Some polygamists are very generous with their wives. They are quickly ready to hand them over to their unmarried relatives, because it gives them advantages. They are able to take a new one and still consider the old one indirectly as their own.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_715_FmTrukL] Bollig claims that polyandry was rare: 'Polyandry seems to be rarer. I knew of only one case, in which two brothers had a common wife.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_716_FmTrukL] But Caughey claims that while polygamy was present, monogamy was the norm for most: 'In the traditional society polygynous marriages rarely occurred. Since marriage sets up heavy obligations to the wife’s lineage, most men did not want to increase this burden, especially by marrying into different lineages. Interpreted differently, the same reasons provided the rationale for those few cases of polygny that did occur. A man who married more than one wife demonstrated his importance and power. It showed that he was capable of engaging in burdensome social relationships with more than one lineage or that he was able to turn this subordinate relationship into one where he dominated. A famous man of bravery on Fáánakkar was once married at the same time to five wives from four different lineages. Later, in a grand gesture of kindness, he gave one of them away to a wifeless brother.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_717_FmTrukL] Expert confirmation is needed on the matter. Information on a possible decline of polygyny in favour of monogamy after Christianization may also be needed.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ absent: 1886-1930 CE; present: 1931-1948 CE ♥</b> Traditionally, informal patterns of self-help, neighbourly assistance and support from the matrilineage were common: 'Within its district each lineage owns a particular plot of land which is regarded as its “true home” or “lineage center” ( imweyiche). The dwelling houses of resident members are typically clustered at this site, and members living elsewhere frequently return here to visit. Persons residing at the lineage center will include some genealogical members of the lineage plus other people who have current links to resident members.

He also has lesser but important rights and obligations to members of his father’s lineage and to members of his spouse’s lineage (for a man this will also be the lineage of his children). Finally he has minor obligations to his father’s father’s lineage and to his spouse’s father’s lineage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_719_FmTrukL] The sources also mention women's organizations: 'Until the mid-1950s, the few women’s organizations in the Trust Territory were religious in nature. During the period of U.S. administration after World War II, women’s clubs took root, spread slowly, and eventually helped “to raise the standard of living, to arouse interest in adult education and... [to play] an ever increasing and important role in providing community leadership” (U.S. Department of State 1963:83). In 1954, mothers had organized themselves in female parent-teacher groups in a few communities of the Trust Territory (U.S. Department of State 1954:70), and by the following year “a few women’s organizations [had] become active, particularly in the Palau and Ponape Districts, in promoting better child, home, and family care and in sponsoring community, social, and educational activities” (U.S. Department of State 1955:70). By 1962, the Trust Territory administration reported that “almost all districts now have local women’s interests officers,” although technically this was true for only three of the six districts, the others subsuming women’s interests under the responsibilities of community development officers (U.S. Department of State 1962:91, 1963:77). In Truk, for example, one of the first women graduates of Truk High School was sent to Hawaii for a six-month training program in commercial sewing at the Institute for Technical Interchange at the East-West Center, and upon her return to Truk she began working in the Community Development Office. Much of her advice to women’s groups away from Moen consisted of teaching them “how to cook and how to sew,” that is, in sharing her special training in home economics (Ibid.). By 1967, more than 60 women’s groups were organized in the Trust Territory, 5 in Truk District (U.S. Department of State 1967:91). Nearly all their activities were focused on women’s traditional domestic and family caretaker roles. Clearly, the stereotypes surrounding women’s roles in the United States at the time limited Trust Territory government efforts to cater to “women’s interests.”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_720_FmTrukL] 'Micronesian and American business and professional women established the first formal women’s club in Truk in 1960. The Trukese-American Women’s Association (or TAWA) included government employees and women engaged in commercial activities ( Truk Review, May-June 1960, p. 4; U.S. Department of State 1960:83). Among the 22 dues-paying members of this new club were women from all government departments and all major trading companies ( Truk Review, May-June 1960, p. 4). The publicized purpose of this organization was modest indeed: “To gain a better understanding of one another and to provide an opportunity for social gatherings...” that occurred approximately once a month (Ibid.).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_721_FmTrukL] 'Beyond church women’s groups, a number of other women’s clubs existed in Truk in the mid-1980s. One—Club 20—was a latter-day version of the old TAWA organization. Club 20 was a multiethnic group of elite Trukese and foreign women who met in Moen restaurants on the 20th of each month and had a maximum membership of 20. According to their bylaws, the purpose of Club 20 was to further members’ social and intellectual interests, and to cooperate with other organizations in advancing community welfare in the areas of beautification, sharing, and scholarships. Money for the scholarship fund was raised from white elephant, bazaar, and bake sales. In 1985, Club 20 had Trukese, Filipino, and American members, including local elite women who held government jobs or whose husbands were important government officials. The most recent attempt at a general organization linking various women’s groups in Truk was the Truk Women’s Association and its Planning Commission. Fin Anisi and Mwichen Maria women central to the temperance movement in Truk (see Chapter Five) established this organization and were the prime movers behind efforts to heighten women’s involvement in the political arena.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_722_FmTrukL] 'Another important women’s club, though one which includes men in some of its activities, is the Truk Red Cross. Koben Mori established the first Red Cross Chapter in Truk in the 1930s (Dolan 1974:59), but it was moribund during most of the American period. In 1984, the wife of one of Koben Mori’s descendants revived the Red Cross organization in Truk to aid local relief efforts after a cholera epidemic. She also hoped the Red Cross would show women they could take care of others in their own communities without outside help. In 1985, recruiting meetings were held in villages throughout Truk State to explain the organization’s goals to [Page 52] women in outlying areas. Essentially, the Truk Red Cross was organized as a private community charity because it was not chartered by either the American Red Cross or the International Red Cross. Truk Red Cross members often carried gifts of soap, towels, or clothing donated by businesses or wealthy Trukese to the elderly poor. In addition to caring for less fortunate people on Moen, Red Cross members have engaged in civic beautification projects—cleaning up rubbish around the airport and the boat pool and planting flowers in public places. The organization sponsored a nine-day-long health care training class in 1987, led by a Honolulu physician, which ended with official first-aid certification of 40 women (The Micronesia Institute 1987). A new building they erected in 1987 was destroyed by Typhoon Nina in November of that year and funds were being sought for its replacement (Ibid.).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_723_FmTrukL] It appears that women's clubs with charitable functions only appeared after WW II. We have chosen the establishment of the Red Cross society as a provisional turning point and adopted 1930 as the date of transition. This is open to review.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ present ♥</b> Construction of meeting houses might qualify. Chiefs could draw on labour services performed by their clan: 'The chief can draw on his people for public works. If the work is done in his private interest, however, he must feed and compensate the people.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_724_FmTrukL] Gladwin also mentions public labour services for the construction of sanitation infrastructure ordered by the colonial government: 'The work activity probably second to food production and preparation, in point of time expended, consists in the maintenance of the island paths, seawalls, and other public works, together with the implementation of the administration’s sanitation directives. One day a week (on a few islands two) is set aside by agreement between the chief and the people for such labor in which all healthy adults from the ages of sixteen to sixty participate through most of the working hours of the day. A cash payment into the island treasury approximately equivalent to the current wage for manual labor may be substituted for this, but can be afforded in general only by those whose regular employment for pay elsewhere precludes their participation. This work is essentially non-productive from the standpoint of the lineages or individuals involved but is rather vaguely felt to be good for the island and in any event is acepted as inevitable. Practically all of the projects undertaken on these island work days can be traced to the orders or recommendations of the present and past foreign administrations; they thus represent a major source of work in excess of the requirements of earlier days.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_725_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> Hospitality was common. Hosts sought protection from greedy guests through food sorcery: 'General food sorcery can be used to aggress against and attempt to control the actions of people who take too great advantage of hospitality patterns. These patterns require that all persons who are present any time food is consumed be invited to participate in the meal. The only strong sanction that can be used against those who become more or less permanent guests is the threat of food sorcery. In addition, these sanctions can be manipulated to keep relatives eating at home, in which case they can also be induced to contribute their labor to help in supplying provisions.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_726_FmTrukL] 'The food sorcery of sub-division B placed a restraint on those who would take undue advantage of hospitality patterns. It can work two ways, by helping prevent depredations on a lineage’s own food supply, and sometimes through illness, reminding lineage members that their safest place is back home helping their own lineages.'

The gods in their customs are often not a bit better than the Truk people themselves. They eat, drink, dance, play, marry, and also perform many a trick which is not at all appropriate for gods. Even Önulap, although the best one in the sky, is a true old Kanaka chief, who lies on his mat in his hut and stares straight ahead. Just like the Truk regions, they have also transplanted in the sky the inhabitants with their good and bad qualities. Is one justified in ridiculing or blaming them, since we have observed the same thing among anciently civilized peoples. Let us look more closely at some of these gods. Semenkoror (father of wisdom) is a brother of Önulap. Human beings are in debt to him for many skills, for which he stands in the highest esteem among all the natives. Silelap (the master), Äremei (achiever), Ämarourou (chatterer), Nugeila[unknown] (the mediator in the sky), Soukuli[unknown], Ororofit, Semoutut (the one not moving).

The beautiful soul resembles a beautiful person; the ugly soul, an ugly person. The manner of existence of these two souls is different. The [unknown]unu[unknown]au has grown together with the body and cannot leave it during its lifetime. [Page 15] The [unknown]unuot, on the other hand, rests on the shoulder of the person. It is lightly winged, like a bird, and can fly away. But an absence of some time would result in the early death of the person. The natives maintain about insane persons that they no longer have any [unknown]unuot. The Truk people explain dreams by the flying away of the good soul. On Truk “A dreams of B” means nothing but that the souls of A and B have flown away and have met in the gathering of the souls of the deceased. If one frightens an islander so that he starts, he will say: “ A äsilo [unknown]uni,” that is, “my soul has flown away.” When a dying person has ceased struggling, it is said: “ A lo [unknown]unun, his soul has gone away.”'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_770_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Omnipresent supernatural beings ♣ present ♥</b> We define "omnipresent supernatural beings" as "all-seeing supernatural beings who are present everywhere and can observe all actions, but can't necessarily read minds or know the intentions underlying actions".

He automatically has pressing obligations to serve others in his own lineages, and he has strong rights to demand support from them in return. He also has lesser but important rights and obligations to members of his father’s lineage and to members of his spouse’s lineage (for a man this will also be the lineage of his children). Finally he has minor obligations to his father’s father’s lineage and to his spouse’s father’s lineage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_813_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> Humility was valued on some islands, but not others, possibly as a result of Christianization: 'These two styles of social interaction seem to be associated with a difference in character values. In writing about Romónum culture in the modern period, ethnographers never mention the ideal of strong thought, and although there are brief allusions to bravery it is not presented as a significant ideal. The literature on Romónum does refer, again and again, to the other major character value we found on Fáánakkar, the importance of mosonoson, which is translated as “humility” or “respectfulness” as opposed to namanam tekiya, which is translated as “haughtiness” or “arrogant behavior”. Given these translations of the value labels and the examples furnished, it appears that the meanings of these terms are similar on Romónum and Fáánakkar.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_814_FmTrukL] But respectfulness was generally valued, although it may have been interpreted differently in different contexts: 'It is expected that people will despise a person of arrogance and that there will be much hostile gossip about him. The resulting shame has driven a number of persons to suicide. Because they hate him, it is also assumed that people will eagerly seek a chance to do him in, and that he will become a target for “foul play” ( sorongngaw). This term refers to sorcery and other stealthy aggressive acts such as ambush and arson. Elders frequently warn younger kinsmen who are acting rudely to be more respectful, lest they meet an early death. Another [Page 51] person’s failure to offer even a single required word of respect is sometimes considered adequate justification for using sorcery against him. Conversely, respectfulness is universally praised. It is also assumed that other people will feel sympathy towards such a person and treat him, in turn, with kindly respectfulness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_815_FmTrukL] Chiefs were owed gifts in produce, given their status as 'symbolic' landowners: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_816_FmTrukL] Chiefs were owed respect: 'Everyone who was not a consanguineal or affinal relative of the chief was heavily “taboo from setting himself above” him. This involved saying “ fääjiro” as an expression of respect on meeting a chief. If further required that one crouch or crawl in the chief’s presence if he was seated, for it was forbidden to have one’s head on a higher plane than his. One avoided initiating social interaction with a chief, unless the need was urgent, in which case one made him a gift and then waited the chief’s pleasure. One could not persist in refusing a chief’s request without being guilty of namanam tekija (arrogant behavior), nor could one address him harshly or belligerently. For persons other than his relatives, a chief occupied the most heavily taboo status with respect to behavior of this kind. (The other categories of persons who shared this status with the chief were jiuag and pwëny (navigators).) His consanguineal and affinal kinsmen, however, behaved toward him in accordance with the status positions which he occupied as their kinsman, at least as far as their being “taboo from above” him was concerned. Other formalities were also accorded a chief. When he walked along a path with a party of people, he went first, unless the path was difficult. In the latter event someone went ahead to clear the way. While crawling behavior and the expression “ fääjiro” are no longer exhibited, a chief still walks first today and the people still feel themselves to be “taboo from above” him.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_817_FmTrukL] Younger siblings had to respect older siblings, and sisters had to respect brothers: 'Younger siblings must obey and respect their older siblings of the same sex. Nor is this obedience and respect a matter of theory only. It is strictly observed in practice, and anyone failing in this is severely censured. Similarly sisters must obey and respect their brothers regardless of their relative age in years, provided only the brothers are past the age of puberty. A sister who consistently fails to do so is virtually disowned by her brothers, who no longer concern themselves about her welfare.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_818_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> Marriage within the kin group was not permitted and apparently considered impure: 'There are not many obstacles to marriage on Truk. Under all conditions marriage within the same kin group is absolutely forbidden (totemism), even if the common root goes back ten degrees. For various kin groups marriage is not permitted, for relatives of the first degree, and, to be sure, in the direct line and collateral line. Therefore marriages between father and daughter, mother and son, and brother and sister are [Page 108] regarded as reprehensible. In this connection adopted siblings and half siblings are regarded as true siblings. It very often happens, however, that a man who marries a widow with an adult daughter takes the latter as a second wife. That is regarded as entirely proper. I have known of one single case in which a Truk chief married his own daughter and had several children with her. The natives frown upon such illegal marriages. They call them, rather crudely, pupulun pig (pig marriage).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_819_FmTrukL] 'All the Truk people are divided into eila[unknown] (kin groups / Sippen/). The mother is bearer of the eila[unknown]. In any case this is connected with the doctrine of Nigoubub, who, as the origin of life, is also female. All children follow the eila[unknown] of the mother. Marriage within the same eila[unknown] is not permitted. A Witö woman may never marry a Witö man. Such a marriage is regarded as incest and is never permitted, even if the common ancestors of the loving couple lie many generations back. On the other hand, marriages between uncle and niece, male cousin and female cousin, father and stepdaughter are not rarities, as long as the eila[unknown] is different. Marriages within the same eila[unknown] were formerly punished by death. Even now this [Page 89] marriage is still detested, even among Christians. I was acquainted with a single case, and the common judgment was: “The man is bad, for he married his sister.” One inquires about the eila[unknown], for example, in the case of women, “ fin med en? (Woman, what sort are you?),” whereupon the answer comes, for for example, “ fin Witö.” For men, the question runs, “ muan meden? (Man, what sort are you?).”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_820_FmTrukL] Some activities caused uncleanness: '1. An unclean person is one who has stepped into sonepuin (1) 1 son = sediment, dregs; puin, night. The soiling can easily happen during nocturnal wanderings on the beach, which the Kanakas use as a toilet. The uncleanness lasts two, four, six, or eight days. During this time the one concerned must refrain from all religious acts. He himself can choose the number of days in proportion to his repentance and his zeal in the worship of the spirits. But it is expressly required that it must be an even number of days or nights, since the odd numbers are unfavorable.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_821_FmTrukL] 'An unclean person is one who has already partaken of food. They express this defect with the words u a olokon, which corresponds somewhat to our “ ich bin nicht mehr nüchtern” /I am no longer fasting/.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_822_FmTrukL] '3. An unclean person is one who has had sexual intercourse, no matter whether marital or extramarital, since the natives make no distinction in this. This defect is designated with the expression u se oloudd, that is literally, I have not slept in the udd (men’s house). Namely, one must consider the fact that no woman was allowed to enter the udd in olden times. Therefore the men who stayed there overnight could not have sexual intercourse. For that reason the expression “to sleep in the udd” means the same as to be continent. Standing in contrast to oloudd is olaim. It means to sleep in the im (dwelling), therefore, to have sexual intercourse.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_823_FmTrukL] This was associated with spiritual dangers and misfortune: 'This oloudd is also a condition for other activities, as well as in connection with offerings, probably because they are subject to the influence of the spirits in a special way. It is required: If the men are obliged to be continent for one of the reasons mentioned above, this does not hold eo ipso for the women as well. They remain completely untouched. One can imagine what bad effects this practice, praiseworthy in itself, must have on family life during a long period. Only in the case of the weierek do the women on some islands also seem to be obligated to be continent. For example, if a man has bad luck because sharks spoil his fishing, he accuses his wife as though she were to blame for it on account of her incontinence. Other islands, on the other hand, deny the obligation of the women.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_824_FmTrukL] 'The people have a great fear of violating these binin. Anyone who violates a binin incurs the penalty of the revenge of spirit concerned, the one that issued it. He becomes feienau. This is the punishment that the people of Truk abhor. They have little understanding for moral defect. One who commits a bad deed and [Page 42] thereby becomes feienau has “sinned.” One who does not fall into this has not committed a sin. That in general is the principle of all Truk people. The conception of sin in the Christian sense is lacking among them. The term dibis that they have now was introduced from the outside and is identical with the above-mentioned feienau, according to the view of the natives.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_825_FmTrukL] Pregnancy, childbirth and menstruation were also considered unclean: 'As long as the child is small, the mother remains free of all work. She does not go fishing and in general does nothing other than merely sit with the child. But nobody will reproach her for it. Her husband brings her food, which is especially made for her ( mo[unknown]o ew fam), since she is still considered unclean. But he is not allowed to stay with her and eat with her as long as the child is not okotap, that is, turns on the mat independently.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_826_FmTrukL] 'The woman who is menstruating or pregnant has something unclean, contemptible, about her. She is isolated from the others; no one who holds a “religious position” as ida[unknown] may enter the little dwelling, prepare her food, or eat anything intended for her. The prohibition ends when the condition does.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_827_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> The in-group coincided with the kin group. Society was organized in matrilineal clans: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_828_FmTrukL] 'Kinship terms are few. A generational mode of reckoning is skewed in a Crow manner so that all members of one's father's lineage are in a senior generation, children of men of that lineage are in one's own generation, and children of men of one's own lineage are in a junior generation.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_829_FmTrukL] Lineage endogamy was not permitted: 'All the Truk people are divided into eila[unknown] (kin groups / Sippen/). The mother is bearer of the eila[unknown]. In any case this is connected with the doctrine of Nigoubub, who, as the origin of life, is also female. All children follow the eila[unknown] of the mother. Marriage within the same eila[unknown] is not permitted. A Witö woman may never marry a Witö man.

The dwelling houses of resident members are typically clustered at this site, and members living elsewhere frequently return here to visit. Persons residing at the lineage center will include some genealogical members of the lineage plus other people who have current links to resident members. Typically some of these will be persons of the same district while others will be members of other districts and occasionally of other islands.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_831_FmTrukL] Individuals had obligations to their own lineage as well as affinal lineages: 'More than one lineage is important to an individual on aanakkar.

Finally he has minor obligations to his father’s father’s lineage and to his spouse’s father’s lineage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_832_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> Bravery was valued on some islands, but values differed between islands: 'When the people of Fáánakkar talk about character and valuables, they assume certain definitions and rules, but they [Page 160] also typically retell or allude to a set of standard illustrative stories in which the rules are encoded. That is, each value label conjures up in people’s minds a series of basic images embodied in a stock of stories about people who behaved with extraordinary bravery, arrogance, or strong thought. Sometimes these stories are based on the semi-legendary exploits of people in the old days ( e.g., the story of how C.J. killed the outer island sorcerer or the tale about the arrogance of N.P., and how he was stabbed by the wronged chief’s nephew). Other stories involve the dramatic behavior of people in the community today ( e.g., accounts of major boundary disputes, knife fights, sorcery battles, and sumptuous feasts). The situations and events in these stories provide a person with standards for measuring the conduct of other people and guidelines for behaving.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_833_FmTrukL] 'Ideal character is not defined this way on Fáánakkar. Respectfulness is a major value there but, as we have seen, it is balanced by an equally heavy emphasis on the aggressive and competitive ideals of bravery and strong thought. None of the accounts of modern Romónum, including the life histories, give any indication that these two character values are major preoccupations on that island. It also appears that acts which would be seen as manifestations of bravery on Fáánakkar are [Page 173] viewed as arrogant on Romónum, while actions which could be defined as cowardice on Fáánakkar are viewed as respectful on Romónum. Swartz shows that it is not only inappropriate or unjustified aggression that is considered wrong on Romónum, all aggression is defined as “haughty” (1958:475). Fighting with kinsmen is very bad, fighting with outsiders is less bad, but fighting is haughtiness (1965:32) and “all ‘haughty’ behavior is bad” ( Ibid.:32). One exception is wife beating, “when a woman violates the proscriptions on ‘haughty behavior’ or is disobedient, her husband may beat her” (1958:472) but “these values (of humble or nonhaughty behavior) also apply to men and combine with the threat of divorce to limit overt aggression against his wife” ( Ibid.:473). In all other relationships, even when someone has grossly violated the norms in a haughty way, aggressive retaliation is not approved; “even the punishing of a criminal is seen as aggressive or haughty” (1965:33). In short, on Romónum, “the cultural norm categorically proscribes aggression” ( Ibid.:38). Clearly this is not true on Fáánakkar where people want to be, and want to be known as, persons who are capable of successful aggression. On Fáánakkar the ideal type, the person of “true bravery”, does not usually engage in unjustified or unprovoked aggression (although he shows he is capable of it) but he must be ready and eager to respond competitively and aggressively when challenged, especially by another’s arrogance. To remain humble in the face of another’s challenge is not respectfulness; it is cowardice, and on Fáánakkar, this is despised at least as much as is arrogance.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_834_FmTrukL] This may be the result of Christianization. Caughey claims that bravery and fierceness were universally valued on Truk prior to colonization: 'However, on Romónum it appears that neither the exclusive stress on respectfulness, nor the “prohibition of aggression” (Swartz 1965:37), nor the unaggressive style of social conduct were characteristic prior to the German pacification of Truk in 1903. In the 19th century, the people of Truk as a whole were considered highly aggressive in comparison to those of other areas in Micronesia. “As is well known, 19th century whalers and other travelers avoided Truk because of its reputation for belligerency toward outsiders, and within the atoll itself warfare was frequent. Although the Spanish held title to Truk from 1885 to 1889 and theoretically administered it [Page 174] from their base at Ponape, they actually did not govern the island. The bellicose nature of the people of Truk was a factor in the Spanish avoidance of the area” (Swartz 1965:17). My information about warfare on 19th century Fáánakkar clearly fits this picture as do the reports of Germans who lived on Truk in the early 20th century. “Truk was one big battlefield. Island fought against island, tribe against tribe. On one day two villages were co-operating; on the next day they were fighting each other. There was constant killing in an ever changing situation” (Bollig 1927:104). Evidently aggressiveness was also common on 19th century Romónum. In tracing the history of Romónum from 1850 to 1903, Goodenough notes that the history begins with a fight, and his account shows that it was permeated by assassinations, bloody feuds, sorcery battles, and warfare with neighboring islands (1951:148-161). Gladwin and Sarason (1953:41) provide additional supporting evidence. It also appears that this aggressive behavior was associated with an ideal of bravery similar to that on Fáánakkar. An example from Goodenough’s history of Romónum will illustrate this point. The incident begins just after assassins, who sneaked up to his meeting house and poked their rifles through the thatch wall, have shot and killed the chief Mwaatejinyk: “All of the occupants of the wuut fled in panic except for Wenejóg... Mwaatejinyk’s grandson. He picked up his grandfather’s body and carried it out of the wuut to prevent its falling into the assassin’s hands. Carrying it down to the north shore of the island, he proceeded west along the rocks on the shore and then climbed back up to... where Mwaatejinyk had lived.... Here Wenejóg buried his grandfather in an upright position leaving his head above ground and facing in the direction of the Pwereka 1 house (his enemy’s lineage center).... He then propped Mwaatejinyk’s mouth open with a stick so that his ghost would go and devour the Mwej people in revenge. This deed earned for Wenejóg a great reputation for bravery” (Goodenough 1951:155-156).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_835_FmTrukL] 'On Romónum, Fáánakkar, and most of the other Truk islands overt aggression was characteristic throughout the 19th century and an aggressive style of behavior has persisted, in [Page 175] modified form, on Fáánakkar and at least some of the other Truk islands. On Fáánakkar, the traditional values of bravery and strong thought have also persisted, and along with respectfulness, they are still important measures of character. On Romónum overt aggression has very much declined, and the aggressive and competitive components of bravery and strong thought are no longer prominent. It also appears that a shift in the meaning of these terms may have taken place such that several classes of behavior encompassed within the traditional ideal of bravery are now condemned as arrogance. In fact, Swartz believes that the people of modern Romónum “consider all the warfare that went on before foreign control to have been ‘haughty”’ (1965:32).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_836_FmTrukL] According to Gladwin, scarification was displayed as a sign of bravery: 'In recent years, such mutilation has been confined almost exclusively to burning with a lighted cigarette; only older persons show any other type of scar. The cigarette is held just touching the skin of the man’s arm by his partner until a burn has been made, and the operation repeated until four, six, or sometimes eight such burns have been made in a double row down the upper arm on either side. The man, of course, makes no outcry before his love and properly should appear unaware even that it hurts. The burns blister immediately and are highly conspicuous. No new scars were observed on women during our stay on Romonum, as might be expected in view of the fact that they were all married with one exception (who was reported by some informants to be hostile toward men), but very few indeed of the older women had scars either, indicating that the practice is at any time rare for a woman. Burning has always been used for this purpose; prior to the introduction of long-burning imported cigarettes by the Japanese this was done by igniting the punk-like dry powder found in dead breadfruit stumps and produced a less neat scar. More commonly small parallel incisions were made with a knife on the man’s arm; a conspicuous scar was often later assured by rubbing dirt into the wound to increase the amount of scar tissue. It is significant that when one informant was describing this practice to Dr. LeBar, he added that identical cuts were made [Page 112] by a man on his own arm to show his bravery and thus intimidate his opponent just prior to a fight. The only mutilation confined to women in this context is a scratch on the cheek, inflicted by the lover with a long sharp thumbnail. Men formerly kept one thumbnail long for this purpose, although again there was also a relevance to fighting for this long nail was useful in slicing an adversary’s eye. No such scratches were observed and informants stated that this no longer takes place; one youth, however (who had no burns on his arm), cherished a long sharp thumbnail but would not divulge its purpose. He simply said he liked it that way.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_837_FmTrukL] Accordingly, we have provisionally coded 'present', although this obscures the ideological variation seen in the colonial period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Property offences included theft, trespass and failure to pay obligations, but these issues were traditionally dealt with through retaliation, not formal punishment: 'There are three main ways in which the property rights of others may be infringed on Truk. The first is theft or the deliberate destruction of another’s property. The second is trespass. The third is default in one’s obligations as a provisional title holder or as the recipient of a loan or niffag. To refuse a kiis to a wife’s brother is more a breach of marital than of property relations.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_838_FmTrukL] 'In aboriginal times no formal action was taken by the community against a thief. It was up to the individual and his corporation (lineage) to collect damages or kill the offender, the latter action frequently leading to a feud with the offender’s lineage. If the identity of a thief was unknown, divination was resorted to in order to discover it. The injured party demanded restitution or payment. If the thief refused, a fight resulted. District chiefs did not interfere directly in such matters. Informants indicated that for them to do so would have been to court the enmity of the entire community. On the other hand, a chief used to preach to his people about the evils of stealing and exhort them to respect each other’s rights in order to hold down dissension within his district.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_839_FmTrukL] 'Trespass applies to two types of situation. The first has to do with entering another’s house without permission. Such action is construed as motivated by a desire to steal something, to leave an object which will sorcerize its occupants, or, if at night, to commit adultery. Its occurence is bound to precipitate, if not a fight, at least bad relations with the occupants of the house.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_840_FmTrukL] 'The other type of trespass consists of entering a section of lagoon or a plot of land on which a “no trespass” sign has been placed. Such a sign is made by tying a young coconut leaflet on a stake in the water or around the trunks of trees. This is called röög (not to be confused with roog, magic). A man may put a röög sign on his property if he is going to be away from his district on a protracted visit. It is (or at least used to be) customary when someone dies for his relatives to put a röög sign on his coconut trees and fishing areas. It may be that this action provides a “cooling off” period before settlement of his holdings. In any case, it serves notice on members of the community that trespass will be construed as an insult to the memory of the dead and will be done at the risk of one’s life. After a few months such a röög is lifted ceremonially, and the property is taken over by the proper heirs. Informants denied that the violator of such a taboo sign on property incurs any penalties of supernatural origin. Violation involves only the risk of having open season declared on one’s life by the property holder and/or his lineage mates.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_841_FmTrukL] Troublemakers could also be socially isolated by their lineages: 'One might assume that dependence on private sanctions for breaches of this kind would provide a situation in which powerful persons and lineages could take advantage of weaker ones. While this has happened, the entire community is likely to unite against a too frequent offender. The property system does not depend, however, on the threat of direct retribution alone. Trouble makers tend to be socially isolated. Even their own lineage mates may eventually withdraw support if their activities too frequently put the lineage in embarrassing situations. These less formal sanctions are usually effective, and a person or group is not likely to violate another’s property rights deliberately and openly except with the definite purpose of precipitating a show-down.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_842_FmTrukL] Sorcery was employed to fight thieves, at least in the past: 'Sorcery is a more direct if more secret form of aggression and is practically precluded from being applied within the lineage by the fact that the spells used are in each case the property of a given lineage. While it is not clear whether they would be considered effective, it is very doubtful that they would be used against others who knew them or could be expected to know them. Data on sorcery are difficult to obtain for no one admits to being a sorcerer. Those cases of afflictions (blindness, psychosis, and paralysis) which were definitely attributed to a given sorcerer always applied to someone on another island, angry because his wife had been taken away, his property trespassed upon, or the like. Although various people on Romonum were said to know certain techniques of sorcery and many people expressed a fear of being sorcerized, no one would say that a given person had actually sorcerized anyone. The detailed body of knowledge of procedures in sorcery which exists and the circumstantial accounts of how it was formerly used certainly suggest very strongly that in the past Trukese deliberately sorcerized other Trukese. Whether this is the case today, however, is an open question. In the past [Page 150] it was used by master magicians, both against rival magicians and against the laity, and was also used in the punishment of thieves; but then as now sorcery was primarily the result of one person’s animosity against another and as such acted as a sanction against acts which might antagonize another. Thus anxiety about sorcery is another factor weighing the balance in favor of conformist behavior.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_843_FmTrukL] 'Even more common than the uwuli aramas is the uwuli ton solä (roasting of thieves). If somebody has had something stolen, he goes to the souatömen so that the latter will help him take revenge on the thief. The souatömen now does the following: [Page 84] He takes a fishing pole and line, ties a small crab to it, sits down in the grass, and sings. In this song he now mentions the names of all those who are suspected of the thievery. As soon as he pronounces the name of the culprit, a kinom or kuen (dark, ugly leguan) jumps out of the grass and bites into the crab. The souatömen seizes the animal, breaks all its bones, and roasts it in a coconut shell. The thief now pines away and must die. But again it is in the hands of the souatömen to put an end to this harsh sentence if the client wishes it in a fit of pity. He rubs the “roasted one” with a protective safei, and the spell is lifted.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_844_FmTrukL] Dogs and traps were also used: 'For protection against nocturnal thieves, many Truk people have dogs which are supposed to alarm the occupants of the huts by their barking. /126/ in order to make the animals really mad and snappish, they take shark and hake’s teeth, pulverize them, and mix them with the dog food. Yet experienced thieves do not let themselves be intimidated even by that. They know how to distract the attention of the dogs and to get into the hut on the side against the wind. To do away with annoying dogs by means of poison and ground glass is also not unknown to them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_845_FmTrukL] 'A better means of protection against thieves than dogs is the averet. This is ray spines or pointed sticks [illegible] in the ground with the tip upward. Whoever steps on them carelessly may tear open the entire sole of the foot.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_846_FmTrukL] According to Goodneough, the possibility of theft was a major source of anxiety although individuals generally respected each other's property rights: 'The possibility of stealing seems to arouse considerable anxiety in the Trukese today as well as formerly, and this despite the fact that they scrupulously respect each other’s rights when in anyone else’s company. They seem always ready to attribute the worst of motives to their fellows.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_847_FmTrukL] But Caughey writes that stealing openly was considered as a sign of fierceness and bravery: 'To steal openly from others is admirable in that it shows a person’s dominance and demonstrates that he is not intimidated by the aggressive powers of others.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_848_FmTrukL] Destroying another's property in revenge was common: 'The Truk people are a little nation that always knows how to twist things so that one’s own self does not come out short. Just because everybody thinks only of himself and wants to have everything, damage in material connections is the most sensitive for them. Whoever wants to take revenge on another and deal him a blow need only do some kind of damage against him and he is stricken. That is why damage to houses and canoes, felling trees, uprooting young plants, and killing domestic animals out of a thirst for revenge so frequently occur.'

Expert input may be needed to resolve this.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. As a result of missionary activities, Christianity spread quickly in the 20th century: 'After 1900 Christianity became well established in most major centres in Micronesia. For the most part, traditional religions ceased being practiced in their full original form, although in Yap and some atolls of the central Carolines, traditional religion continued to be practiced until the middle of the 20th century. Missionaries and travelers recorded descriptions of certain aspects of the island religions, but there is no complete and systematic account.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_850_FmTrukL] However, we have coded for the 'traditional' religion. The literature makes it clear that the Chuukese believed that transgressions could be punished by supernatural beings [MAJIDBENAM_REF_851_FmTrukL]. It's worth noting that incest was punished [MAJIDBENAM_REF_852_FmTrukL]--though it's not clear by whom. eHRAF provides a general description of ritual specialists: 'Ritual practices were conducted by their own specialists. They included spirit mediums, breadfruit summoners, fish summoners, healers, masters of spells, masters of sorcery, builders, navigators, diviners, and most importantly the masters of magic and ritual relating to war and politics. Their knowledge was private property passed down to their children and junior lineage mates.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_853_FmTrukL] Spirit mediums were important, but we have found no evidence of them being involved in moralistic punishment: 'In the space of this work we shall consider only the direct residing, which manifests itself in the belief in the nanönu / uanönu/. It is to be recalled that, according to the views of the islanders, the spirit which has appeared at the invocation of the spirits takes up residence on the far. The uanönu is in the service of this far and the spirit sojourning on it. He makes the far, hangs it up, tends to the asor, calls the spirit to jump down from it and settle on his neck. In this condition he speaks with the spirit, asks him questions in the spirit language, presents to him the people’s wishes, and also receives many a revelation. The common people prefer to have recourse to the uanönu in their religious needs. All the spirits, except for Onulap, seem ready to jump down, but especially those of the most recently deceased. The uanönu like to see the souls of deceased children coming down to them, because they have the advantage of being wenewen, that is, sincere, while adults are even able to deceive the uanönu. Some uanönu asserted that never yet had the soul of a deceased Christian come down to them. Anyone /61/ men, women, boys, girls, can be chosen as uanönu or uomar, that is, canoe of the spirit. The choice is wholly at the discretion of the spirit.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_854_FmTrukL] 'As soon as someone in the tribe has died, the people gather and tempt the soul so that it will settle down on the far and choose one of the persons present as uanönu. If the spirit grants this plea, the one chosen is regarded as uanönu until the spirit leaves him again. If the people have a request about which the spirit is to give information, he is summoned. The uanönu is the medium. The summoning takes place amid certain ceremonies. At night the people gather in the udd in which the far is hung. A quantity of food and other objects is collected, in part as asor [Page 68] for the önu, in part as gifts for the uanönu, in order to make them both obliging. Then the dancers grasp the kurukur and dance the spirit dance ( dugia), in order to show the spirit their veneration. The uanönu lies calmly on his mat and waits for the right moment. He suddenly feels as though goose flesh were spreading over him. He jumps up, takes hold of the kurukur, and jumps about, while he shouts hi, hi... It is not long before he feels by the heaviness of his neck that the spirit is sitting on him. He stands still, begins to tremble, bends under the weight of his neck, and sometimes even begins to foam. He presses his lips together hard so as not to speak quickly, since he might easily falsely announce the spirit’s words because of hurrying too fast. Finally the people call to him: “ Wäsi me[unknown]inom, tell your revelations.” The uanönu now asks the spirit: “ E seiö, who are you?” (In ordinary speech: en iö?) Whereupon the spirit begins to talk. The people pose their questions, express their wishes, which the uanönu communicates to the spirit in spirit language and receives the answer in the same language. The summoning is not always done in this fussy manner. Some uanönu are so easily susceptible that it suffices to strike them on the arm with an ubud, and they begin to tremble.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_855_FmTrukL] 'The performance does not always turn out as desired. It might be that the spirit who settles down is an “ onu[unknown]au or önurot, which the people notice at once by the furious, wild behavior of the uanönu. Then they quickly hide everything dangerous, such as knives, fire, etc., so that the uanönu cannot cause a disaster for anybody, for it has often happened, as the natives asserted, that such a raging one /62/ threw all kinds of things at the heads of those present and ran after them with bush knives. If, on the other hand, the uanönu speaks calmly and softly, the people are delighted, for the spirit is an önusor. Unfortunately, however, the revelations not infrequently turn out to be wholly a fraud. Then the natives grumble about the false uanönu and önumaken (liar spirit), but they do not so quickly lose faith in the business. Next time it will turn out better.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_856_FmTrukL] 'The uanönu also has the privilege of seeing the souls of human beings and the spirits in dreams. Thus an uanönu in Param told me one he had seen at night, while sleeping, a number of spirits in the middle of the island, as they danced together. The soul of a man who was still living was also present. That could become dangerous for the poor fellow, however, because how easily might the fickle soul stay away entirely, and then he would have to die. Therefore, as soon as a native hears that a dreaming uanönu has seen his soul, there is nothing more urgent for him to do than to wrap up a few good things, go to the uanönu, and ask him if he would catch again the one that escaped. That is, the uanönu also knows this art. It is called ama[unknown]un. The uanönu makes a certain safei, pours it into a coconut shell, and looks in. All the souls that have flown away now gather in this safei and look like drops of blood. He fishes out the foreign souls by means of a sou and throws them away. The soul of the petitioner, however, remains. The uanönu gives the safei with the captured soul to the unfortunate one to drink and he goes away beaming with joy. He has his soul back and need not die yet, while the uanönu has the gifts. Envious souls on Truk say about the uanönu that they see the most at precisely those times when their chests are the emptiest.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_857_FmTrukL] 'There is still another kind of uanönu, called mo[unknown]epui. These indeed see the human souls that have flown away, but do not understand the art of getting them back. They do not play any role among the Truk people.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_858_FmTrukL] 'The uanönu has another task during the performance of the spirit dances. The uanönu stands with the safei in the middle of his rows of dancers. This spot is called poönu, that is, bed of the spirit. No one may crowd close to this place. When the procession goes to the dancing place, the uanönu goes before his tribe, his blow-shell in one hand, giddun, /63/ that is, coconut offering for the spirit, in the other. When he steps into the udd, he throws down the coconut. He stations himself wherever it falls, and his dancers crowd around him. He gives them some of the safei to drink, so that the evil sorcery of the troops of dancers and their leaders will not harm them. Then [Page 70] he rubs his shell with curcuma and puts it down with the opening upwards. While the troop is dancing, the uanönu of the other party does all kinds of sorcery in order to disturb the dance. He likewise takes his shell, rubs it with charcoal, and puts it down with the opening downwards. His companions tie an ubud around their necks as a sign for the dancers that they should hang themselves. It now depends on which of the two parties can practice better sorcery. The defeated party is put to shame during the dance. The dancers’ voices fail.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_859_FmTrukL] 'A number of binin surround the uanönu. Besides the above-mentioned ones, which also hold for most of his ro[unknown] colleagues, he is not allowed to eat apot or oranges. The people must be careful not to sneeze in his presence, for the spirits do not like that. If the uanönu wants to get rid of his spirit -- which is not at all rare -- he only need bathe in stinking apot water, and the spirit will no longer come to him.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_860_FmTrukL] 'There are a great many of these uanönu on Truk. On the island of Fefan, which numbers scarcely 2,000 people, there are more than 90 of them, some of whom still practice their profession. Although these uanönu do not have the authority of the ida[unknown], they still sincerely contribute their share in supporting heathen customs and practices and keeping the spirit cult alive. Many a movement toward Christianity in tribes still heathen was suppressed by the intrigues of the uanönu. Although, on the one hand, many a former uanönu, men and women, came over to Christianity, on the other hand, it was precisely the uanönu still practicing who were the most obstinate opponents of the faith, even more than the ida[unknown].' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_861_FmTrukL] Other ritual specialists were associated with warfare and politics: 'During the battle the ida[unknown] is near his men. If he wants to see the fighting ended, he throws himself between the lines of the ones fighting and cries, “ e bue le iou,” whereupon the warriors reply, “ e bue le iou (it shall be finished),” and the fighting stops. Anyone who does not obey this call is “bitten” by the ida[unknown] and is killed in the next battle. If there are people of the ida[unknown] who were killed in the battle, they may not be buried immediately, because the ida[unknown] must first inspect their position. Namely, if one lies with his feet toward the region of the enemy, as though he wanted to give him a kick, then there are no difficulties about the burial. But if it is the opposite, then the ida[unknown] first has to bring the corpse into the proper position. While singing, he pushes and turns the dead until his feet fortunately have the desired direction. Only then may his comrades carry him away. As respected as the ida[unknown] is by his own party, so is he hated by the opposite party, since they not unjustly attribute the war to his intrigues. If he falls into the hands of the enemy, he is tortured alive in front of the enemy soönu.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_862_FmTrukL] These specialists employed sorcery to retaliate against their enemies and people who slighted them, but we have found no evidence of third-party moralistic punishment: 'The ida[unknown] are also masters in the sphere of sorcery. Their word is regarded as puitikar (hot), which means destructive. An ordinary bite of the ida[unknown] causes a swollen throat. A curse cast by him on an unfortunate person devours the latter’s soul, that is, his life.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_863_FmTrukL] 'The occasion for this curse is the anger of the ida[unknown] because the careless so-and-so is so disrespectful as to make noise in his vicinity. It is no wonder that the people are afraid of a man who has such power in his mouth. Yet it is to be added for the vindication of the honor of the ida[unknown] that he also possesses various safei which end the effects of the bites and curses. Good pay, however, is a preliminary condition.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_864_FmTrukL] Sorcery was a common means of retaliation: 'What embitters life most for the Truk natives is the boud (sorcery to harm one). The boud occurs in innumerable forms. Nearly all souro[unknown] know how to make the boud with the help [Page 83] of their önu; the ida[unknown] in particular is a feared souboud. Yet there are also very distinct souboud who, with the help of an önu[unknown]au, are able to bring all kinds of trouble to human beings. How often one can hear from sick people the words: “ Emen a boud [unknown]eniei, somebody has cursed me, bewitched me.” The boud prevents women from giving birth, disturbs children’s growth, makes limbs swell, spoils one’s work, steals the [unknown]unuot, and brings inevitable death. Fear of the boud is a true tyranny for the unhappy, heathen Truk people.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_865_FmTrukL] 'A radical boud is the uwuli or umuni aramas (roasting human beings). If the souboud cannot get at a person whom he hates, he will kill him symbolically, which soon has as a consequence his actual death. For this purpose he sends his wife into the lölö to search for “his fish” ( iken ro [unknown]). The fishing women know the meaning. As soon as they have caught the fish, they lament the person condemned to death. They bring the fish to the souboud, who breaks the backbone bends it everywhere, and then roasts it. He buries the roasted fish or secretly puts it under the cursed person’s sleeping mat. The fala[unknown] (cookhouse) in which the act has taken place is abandoned and no longer used in the future, because the curse clings to it.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_866_FmTrukL] 'The person concerned, however, the one who was sentenced to death in this fashion, still has a chance to escape his fate if he learns about the boud soon enough. He simply has himself /75/ “roasted” again by a souro[unknown], whereby the first “roasting” is neutralized. The souro[unknown] makes a hole in the ground in the house of the person concerned, puts the counter- safei in it, and covers it with hot stones so that it steams. Over this he spreads coconut fronds together with the sleeping mat of the “patient.” The latter now has nothing else to do but to lie on it for a time. The boud is destroyed by this simple method, and the threat to life removed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_867_FmTrukL] 'Even more common than the uwuli aramas is the uwuli ton solä (roasting of thieves). If somebody has had something stolen, he goes to the souatömen so that the latter will help him take revenge on the thief. The souatömen now does the following: [Page 84] He takes a fishing pole and line, ties a small crab to it, sits down in the grass, and sings. In this song he now mentions the names of all those who are suspected of the thievery. As soon as he pronounces the name of the culprit, a kinom or kuen (dark, ugly leguan) jumps out of the grass and bites into the crab. The souatömen seizes the animal, breaks all its bones, and roasts it in a coconut shell. The thief now pines away and must die. But again it is in the hands of the souatömen to put an end to this harsh sentence if the client wishes it in a fit of pity. He rubs the “roasted one” with a protective safei, and the spell is lifted.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_868_FmTrukL] 'In former times the natives hardly dared walk across the sandy shore, for the footprints impressed in the soft sand could easily bring about their ruin. If a souboud saw the prints of someone hated by him, he lifted them up, put them in a bowl, and cooked them together with a certain safei. If the sorcery was successful, the feet and legs of the person in question would swell.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_869_FmTrukL] 'Jealous women likewise sometimes let themselves be carried away and have recourse to the boud. For example, if a mother sees that the child of her neighbor is growing better than her own, she makes the safeien usiwör, and the bewitched child will become a cripple.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_870_FmTrukL] 'The soumaram ( maram, moon) is feared as a sorcerer. In the opinion of the Truk people he has a mysterious connection with the moon. When the moon appears in the west ( sikauru, first quarter) the natives do not dare pronounce the moon’s name in the presence of the soumaram. /76/ Instead of “a li[unknown]maram, the moon shines,” they say, “ a war ewe samol, that chief appears,” since the moon is the chief of the night.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_871_FmTrukL] 'Some souboud also have a method for harming people by throwing a sorcery- safei into people’s land or house at night. The most suitable nights for this are those between the first quarter and full moon, and, to be sure, toward morning. The souboud wraps his head, throat, hands and feet with ubud and, swaying his body back and forth while singing, he approaches the house. As a precaution, however, he has a few precious things [Page 85] with him as pen manauan (ransom). Namely, at the time of the boud the occupants of the houses are on the lookout in order to catch a possible souboud. He now hopes, in case he should be detected in his dirty work, to savelhimself from punishment by means of gifts. This does not always seem to succeed, however, for on many islands it is told how such souboud would be paid their reward with the bush knife. The souboud also has a method for recognizing whether his sorcery is effective against a given house or not. He pours safei into a bowl, puts some glowing stones into it, and inoffensively passes the house in question. If the steam of the safei goes toward the house, the boud will be successful; if not, he must repeat it.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_872_FmTrukL] However, this does not seem to constitute third-party moralistic punishment. Clarification on the difference between retaliation and punishment is needed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Type of punishment this typically entailed (can be more than one):</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b> It appears that troublemakers were killed prior to colonization, at least occasionally. This included people who committed incest: 'All the Truk people are divided into eila[unknown] (kin groups / Sippen/). The mother is bearer of the eila[unknown]. In any case this is connected with the doctrine of Nigoubub, who, as the origin of life, is also female. All children follow the eila[unknown] of the mother. Marriage within the same eila[unknown] is not permitted. A Witö woman may never marry a Witö man. Such a marriage is regarded as incest and is never permitted, even if the common ancestors of the loving couple lie many generations back. On the other hand, marriages between uncle and niece, male cousin and female cousin, father and stepdaughter are not rarities, as long as the eila[unknown] is different. Marriages within the same eila[unknown] were formerly punished by death. Even now this [Page 89] marriage is still detested, even among Christians. I was acquainted with a single case, and the common judgment was: “The man is bad, for he married his sister.” One inquires about the eila[unknown], for example, in the case of women, “ fin med en? (Woman, what sort are you?),” whereupon the answer comes, for for example, “ fin Witö.” For men, the question runs, “ muan meden? (Man, what sort are you?).”' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_873_FmTrukL] This was discontinued in the colonial period, but offenders could be sentenced to labour: 'Another weak point of the chiefs is partiality. Members of the chief’s kin group, blood relatives, and friends are not readily punished, not even for serious crimes. On the other hand, poor devils whom the chief cannot bear are sentenced to hard labor for the slightest reason or are reported to the government as “disobedient ones” or “rebels.” In the old days the Truk chiefs did away with troublesome persons by means of the knife; today they do it by means of lies and false denunciations.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_874_FmTrukL] Some sources claim that chiefs gained more power to punish offenders in the colonial period, but the precise character of these sanctions is unclear: 'A greater apparent gain from the presence of foreign power is the chief’s ability to punish those who offend against the community. Although there is an independent judiciary, on Romónum, at least, the division of labor is not very clear, and the chief spends a good deal of time considering the enforcement of laws passed either by his own island legislature or by the yearly assembly of chiefs of all the islands in the atoll.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_875_FmTrukL] 'It might seem that interlineage political structure gained strength through the addition of power to punish deviants and prosecute offenders, but if we are to judge by the effectiveness of this force as customarily used, it does not make a major contribution to political organization by outside domination.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_876_FmTrukL] We have provisionally treated forced labour as a form of physical punishment.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ exile ♣ absent ♥</b> Goodenough mentions the case of a man who fleed his island during a feud, but this was not exile in the sense of formal punishment: 'Remaining in the older house were two sisters, Nijeejice, who was married to Cëëppywn (P3a), and Nijeejinen, who was married to Mwaatejinyk (P2a). In the feud between Pwereka 2 and Pwereka 3a following the murder of Jöku, Cëëppwyn and Mwaatejinyk were on opposing sides, and the former was eventually forced to flee Romonum, going to live for a time on Moen. When Mwaatejinyk became island chief he gave his children the plots of Neemwëc (720-470), Neeceemej (420-460), Neejimwetä (390-450), and Neeram (460-490), and built a house for his wife and daughters at Neeceemej, thereby establishing the Söör 2a descent line. Full or residual title to the soil of these plots is now considered the property of this descent line. When Cëëppwyn returned from exile, he gave his children the land plot Neejöör (540-470), where he, too, built a house for his wife and daughters, who founded the present Söör 2b descent line. All three descent lines continued to operate as a single lineage with one wuut—the old one at Fënykytiw was moved to Neetupw (580-350)—and one fanag, forming an over-all corporation holding full or residual title to the old sööpw lands collectively called Pwowunög.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_877_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ loss/seizure of property or wealth ♣ present ♥</b> Wronged spouses could demand compensation from adulterers: 'As long as the adultery is secret, nobody does anything about it. But as soon as it comes into the open, the one or the other deceived marital partner causes an uproar and deserts the unfaithful one, although he himself perhaps does the same thing in secret. But there are many married couples who do not even get excited about such “little things.” They discuss the case very calmly, since now they have a double reason to repay unfaithfulness with unfaithfulness, and no harm can be done to them. But I have heard that in a few cases the deceived wives took revenge on their husbands by suddenly breaking off during the next coitus, which caused an injury to the men, as a result of which they died. According to native law the insulted husband can demand compensation from the seducer of his wife. In order that no hostility arise between the families on account of the payment, however, the sinning woman likewise gives compensation to the wronged wife of her seducer. Thus equilibrium is established again. If the culprit cannot pay the compensation ( fes) by himself, the other relatives must contribute clothing, knives, necklaces, fishing nets. Houses, land, and canoes may serve as a basis for the fees.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_878_FmTrukL] Prior to colonization, adultery was also dealt with through blood vengeance, but this was discontinued in the colonial period. However, forced labour was still practiced: 'In olden times war often arose as a result of such adultery. The insulted husband sought revenge by killing the seducer. In more recent times the guilty wife was also punished by the chief and sentenced to forced labor. But the measure had little success. As soon as the adulteress seems to repent, /97/ everybody has pity on her, her husband first of all. She is pardoned [Page 105] again, a good meal is prepared for her, and everything is forgiven and forgotten. These sores on Truk marriage can be healed, not by external force, but by awakening the moral sense through Christianity.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_879_FmTrukL] Lineages that failed to pay obligations to chiefs had their property confiscated: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.'

Breadfruit, supplemented by wet taro, was the staple. Being seasonal, breadfruit was preserved by fermenting in pits. Copra has become the only export. Fishing was important.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_882_FmTrukL] 'Traditionally, men gardened, cooked and processed food in bulk (in the earth oven), did deep-water fishing, engaged in war and public affairs, and practiced the arts of canoe and house building and of wood, shell, and stone working. Women wove, plaited mats, prepared meals (as distinct from food in bulk), did inshore fishing, and took main responsibility for child care.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_883_FmTrukL] 'Traditional crafts included: making outrigger paddle canoes; building houses; woodworking (to make bowls, storage chests, spears); gardening; cordage (to make rope, string, slings); working stone (for sling stones), shell (for adz blades), and coral (for breadfruit pounders); preparing medicines; loom weaving with hibiscus and banana fibers (to make loin clothes, wraparound skirts, shirts, mosquito canopies); plaiting (of baskets, mats); and other leaf working (for thatch, sun hats). Sewing arts and dressmaking have replaced weaving.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_884_FmTrukL] Some trade schools were established in the colonial period: 'A further step on the educational ladder was eventually provided with the establishment of a trade school for carpenters at Koror, Palau, a thousand miles to the west. Promising graduates of the higher elementary schools were selected from all over the mandated territory to attend this school. Later a small agricultural school was established on Dublon Island, Truk, and, after the Japanese started to alienate “undeveloped” native land for colonization, a surveyor’s school was established in Palau.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_885_FmTrukL] Economic 'development' was interrupted during the World Wars: 'While the militarization of Truk, which was to prove a disatrously inadequate bastion for the Japanese in the second World War, changed the emphasis of Japanese [Page 45] development of the islands, it served merely to accelerate the processes of change in the Trukese society initiated earlier by the economic development program which of course continued but on a lesser scale. But with the beginning of the air strikes against Truk in 1944, and the blockade which followed, the fruits of the Japanese efforts at economic development were destroyed and the necessity of supporting some 35,000 foreigners in addition to the almost 10,000 Trukese off the land resulted in a serious depletion of their resources. Intensive cultivation of sweet potatoes made unfit for use many acres of good gardening land, and the extensive use of explosives in fishing, as well as the underwater explosion of many aerial bombs and mines, depleted the fish population to an extent which is felt to the present day. While there are still plenty of fish, they are not as numerous in any one place, and therefore harder to catch.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_886_FmTrukL] Commercial fishing was introduced in the colonial period. Goodenough's comments seem to imply that further economic diversification only emerged under American administration: 'Okinawans developed commercial fishing during Japanese rule; and some commercial fishing on a small scale was continued by the Chuukese after World War II. Under American rule, the principle source of cash income was government employment as teachers and program administrators. Tourism was unimportant.'

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_889_FmTrukL] We have assumed that in the colonial period, the number of native petty officials and craftsmen was very small, with most islanders remaining in subsistence horticulture. Accordingly, some of the below variables might not apply to the colonial-period Chuuk islands.*******Money was introduced by the colonial administration: 'The impact of these economic changes upon the Trukese was great. Just as under the Germans law and order were made the province of the administration, a step which can be reversed (without chaos) only by a long and intelligently directed course of evolution, so under the Japanese the step to a money economy and dependence upon some categories of imported goods was carried far enough beyond the German beginnings so that it too has become irreversible. While the Trukese were not indoctrinated in the more skilled techniques, such as deep-sea fishing and boat-building, there were many jobs available at manual labor, an ever-increasing flow of trade goods upon which to spend the earnings thereof, and head taxes to assure that those who did not work cut copra. The Trukese began to travel more and more on Japanese boats (many of which they have now taken over and operate), to use a wider variety of Japanese tools, to eat (although not depend upon) rice and canned fish, and to wear clothese exclusively of foreign material.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_890_FmTrukL] Marshall, writing in the 1970s, describes banks in urban centres: 'The district’s oldest and largest commercial complex—Truk Trading Company (TTC)—has been joined in recent years by a number of modern air-conditioned stores selling everything from hardware to imported food to clothing and locally made handicraft (figures 3 and 4). Prominently displayed on the shelves of most of these stores is a wide array of imported alcoholic beverages. Scattered among these stores and government offices are four small, locally owned hotels, two of which run popular bars; the district’s radio station (WSZC); two local produce markets; the Bank of America; and the U.S. Post Office, complete with its own Zip Code. Also located downtown are a large public elementary school, the boat pool, several churches, and a variety of housing ranging from tropical-palatial to ghettolike. The downtown streets are paved, and most persons who live downtown have electricity and running water.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_891_FmTrukL] It is unclear from his description when banks were established for the first time. Swartz seems to imply that Chuukese households often stored money and wealth items in their homes: 'In strictly interpersonal disputes between spouses, the wife’s brothers often side with the husband. One morning I heard a young man shouting at his wife that she had lost the key to the locked box she shared with him. (Everyone has a box that can be locked, in which prayer books, money, or other valuables are kept.) As I approached the house, the woman rushed out carrying her infant daughter and followed by her husband, who was brandishing a machete. He shouted “You are very disobedient,” and struck her across the chest with the flat of the machete. The woman staggered back and began to wail that the baby had been cut. Her brother, who was with me, ran to her and began shaking her. “See the price of your disobedience!” he told her. The brother explained afterward that his sister was not virtuous ( mirit) and that she “drove everyone crazy.” The woman’s brothers must also protect a man’s marital rights with their sister if the husband fulfills his obligations to them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_892_FmTrukL] Accordingly, we have assumed that savings schemes were absent prior to WW II.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Price controls ♣ ♥</b> See above.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Regulations against hoarding/stockpiling goods ♣ ♥</b> See above.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Regulations regarding usury ♣ ♥</b> See above.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Debt-relief measures ♣ ♥</b> See above.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Pensions ♣ absent ♥</b> See below.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Standardization of weights/measures ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Prior to colonization, islanders employed no formal system of weights and measures. Bollig claims that in house construction, materials were measured by eye rather than abstract standards: 'The method of construction of the udd is the simplest imaginable. Four mighty corner posts ( ur) are driven into the ground, on which longitudinal beams ( dilöu) extending across are set and lashed. On the longitudinal beams rest the crossbeams (outam), and, to be sure, in the case of larger udd, three of them, the thick one in the middle. Into the crossbeams are inserted small posts, on which then directly rests the heavy ridge-beam ( uin), which, like all beams, consists of one piece. The beams are not nailed since the old Truk people were unfamiliar with iron. They took wooden pegs or tied the beams together with coconut cord, which can hold for decades. The modern Truk people do use nails. Finally, the rafters are put up and lashed, and the framework is completed. One might think that this work would be done quickly, but far from it, for the natives have to be always changing and turning so that the house will not be crooked and humpy. They are not familiar with measuring instruments; everything is done by eye. Although some udd are beautifully and precisely constructed, nevertheless nothing of true art is to be noted, for it would have to be the rafters, which are crudely notched here and there and even more crudely painted with black, white, or red paint.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_893_FmTrukL] Volume was measured in 'handfuls': 'These linear measures are also used in part as dry measures insofar as the people put the finger or the hand into the bowl and thus determine the height from the ground. The hand too is a dry measure; epö is a handful.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_894_FmTrukL] So far, no information on weights has been found. However, Bollig mentions some linear measures: 'These linear measures are also used in part as dry measures insofar as the people put the finger or the hand into the bowl and thus determine the height from the ground. The hand too is a dry measure; epö is a handful.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_895_FmTrukL] 'They are not all alike in style either. Every island and also every important canoe-builder ( soufalafal) have their own style ( sän). The word sän means rope, because in hewing the keel, /129/ which has considerable influence on the usefulness of the canoe, the measuring is done with a piece of rope. The cances are differentiated according to the method of measuring. Thus, one distinguishes sänin Ku (old name for Mortlock), sänin Poluot, säniged, etc.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_896_FmTrukL] While colonial administrators probably employed their received weights and measures, we are unsure how quickly these became common usage among the Chuukese. We have provisionally assumed that informal measurements remained common throughout the colonial period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Guarantee stability of coin value ♣ present ♥</b> Prior to colonization, Chuukese exchange systems were not monetized. Islanders traditionally engaged in trading expeditions and barter trade: 'At the present time, sailing canoes suitable for long trips remain in use only in the small islands of the Caroline group scattered widely over the ocean from Truk westward. The language and culture found on these islands relate them clearly to Truk, whereas most of them fell historically under the hegemony of Yap to the west—a tie which Lessa (1956) has demonstrated is by no means completely extinct. Both Truk and Yap possess volcanic soils which can support crops impossible of cultivation on the sandy coral islets which lie between. Trade therefore provided the impetus for travel to and from the high islands, and there was in addition considerable social visiting back and forth between all the islands. Some voyages, apparently of exploration, have also been recorded extending over hundreds of miles to Guam and even remoter islands. Trips of up to 200 miles or so are still made, although with reduced frequency. Canoes are also used on a few islands other than those mentioned above for interisland, but essentially local, travel to Truk and Ponape.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_897_FmTrukL] 'The acquisition of property on Truk is usually done by means of barter. Lands, houses, and canoes are bartered. Smaller units of exchange are sebi (wooden bowls), deig (curcuma), faupar (red shell disks), hip mats, modesty bands, fishing nets, aromatic oils, coconut cord, home-grown tobacco, and sleeping mats. These products of native industry are not present in like quantity or in like quality on all the islands. Thus, Sapesis on Fefan is famous for its fine bowls, Pol for curcuma and oils, Iluk for its fine hip mats.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_898_FmTrukL] 'Weaving generally takes place at certain times, especially when the canoes from the low islands are expected, the inhabitants of which barter for things. In former times not very nice [Page 186] customs were associated with weaving. When the women had completed their work, they put on the new mats and gathered on the shore.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_899_FmTrukL] Money was introduced by the colonial administration: 'The impact of these economic changes upon the Trukese was great. Just as under the Germans law and order were made the province of the administration, a step which can be reversed (without chaos) only by a long and intelligently directed course of evolution, so under the Japanese the step to a money economy and dependence upon some categories of imported goods was carried far enough beyond the German beginnings so that it too has become irreversible. While the Trukese were not indoctrinated in the more skilled techniques, such as deep-sea fishing and boat-building, there were many jobs available at manual labor, an ever-increasing flow of trade goods upon which to spend the earnings thereof, and head taxes to assure that those who did not work cut copra. The Trukese began to travel more and more on Japanese boats (many of which they have now taken over and operate), to use a wider variety of Japanese tools, to eat (although not depend upon) rice and canned fish, and to wear clothese exclusively of foreign material.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_900_FmTrukL] But barter continued into the colonial period: 'As a result of the German, Japanese, and American administrations, the natives have become thoroughly aware of the value of money in relation to specific situations. It is needed to pay taxes and is required for the purchase of goods from local retail outlets. Money is in fairly wide use in native transactions, though barter continues as the more practical form of exchange. Two informants, for example, had no trouble in estimating the cash price of a coconut tree (if not old) at $2.00 and that of a breadfruit tree at $5.00, a big one fetching perhaps as much as $10.00. Sales of trees are, however, fairly rare. If they should become more common, one might predict that the price would rise to accord with their economic importance. As the present prices suggest, money plays no part in the domestic food economy. It is needed to purchase food by only a handful of natives. Except for them, money is treated simply as an important sort of movable property ( pisek). One may make a niffag of money, trade it for goods or for labor, and have it appropriated by one’s wife’s brothers as a kiis.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_901_FmTrukL] In this case, the variable refers to German and Japanese currencies which were introduced to Chuuk in the colonial period. Accordingly, we have assumed that this variable applies here.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Public markets ♣ present ♥</b> Commercial fishing was introduced in the Japanese period, but apparently limited to foreigners at the time: 'Okinawans developed commercial fishing during Japanese rule; and some commercial fishing on a small scale was continued by the Chuukese after World War II. Under American rule, the principle source of cash income was government employment as teachers and program administrators. Tourism was unimportant.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_902_FmTrukL] But Bollig implies that some form of market exchange was present in the colonial period, as evidenced in cash cropping: 'Little lul is made on the Truk Islands, out of fear of evil sorcery, so the people say. So much the better is it understood by the inhabitants of the small low islands of Mortlock, Poluot /Puluwat/, etc., where the old men in particular try to make themselves useful by the twisting of lul. The cord comes on the market in large, carefully wound balls, which often contain several hundred [unknown]af. One hundred [unknown]af form esän, that is, a rope. The value of the esän is about one mark, which is not too much, considering the work. In former times even cheaper coconut cord was available.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_903_FmTrukL] 'A type of cultivation which was vigorously pursued in ancient times, but which is now dying out through the influence of the Europeans, is that of the curcuma ( efen or also äfän). The curcuma fields are nicely hoed and free of all weeds. When the tubers have ripened, they are dug up, washed clean, and prepared. Out of superstition the preparation is done only when the moon is waning, probably because the time of the waxing moon is the time of sorcery. /147/ The tubers are grated and strained through a spread piece of cloth ( tôtô), and the water collected in a bowl. The fine, yellow substance (son) now settles here. It is poured into coconut shells, cooked over a fire, and pressed into forms. Now it is called deig and comes on the market.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_904_FmTrukL] More detail is needed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Contracts</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ State enforcement ♣ ♥</b> We are unsure whether the colonial administration enforced contracts among Chuukese parties. It appears that colonial courts dealt with litigation, but these disputes might have been based on informal agreements and conventions rather than formal contracts.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Non-state enforcement ♣ ♥</b> So far, we have found no material on contracts per se. But even prior to colonization, senior lineages and dominant clans could grant residential and usufruct rights to junior groups on a provisional basis: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_905_FmTrukL] Individuals could also grant provisional land rights to other individuals: 'Land was held privately both by individuals and matrilineal, corporate descent groups. Rights in undeveloped space, productive soil, trees and gardens were separable. When soil and breadfruit trees were given in grant, the grantor retained residual rights and the grantee acquired provisional rights. Grantors and grantees could be either individuals or corporations. Full rights went to the survivor on the death or extinction of the other.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_906_FmTrukL] We are unsure whether this constitutes a contract according to our Code Book. Chiefs occasionally confiscated property granted to junior lineages and provisional title holders in case of disobedience (such as failure to deliver food prestations on the occasion of feasts): 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.'

Causes of famine might be a typhoon or a long drought. A lack of rain for three to four months can be disastrous for the islands, since, with the thin layer of humus, all the plantings /166/ die. In such times of famine many cases of death always occur; the families broke up, because everybody was only concerned with saving his own skin. The people cut down the coconut trees and ate the heart (faunepon), which resulted in the death of many. There was no longer any order. Looting theft, and murder were the order of the day. Especially clever ones carried soil onto very high trees and raised some tobacco there.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_908_FmTrukL] 'An old saying gives the following advice for a famine: “ nugu sebi, nugu neif, nugu lul. Protect the bowl, the knife, the coconut cord.” That is, one who has a bowl can make himself mogemog (arrowroot) when other foodstuffs are exhausted. This mogemog grows wild in great quantities and, although the Truk people like to eat it, is hardly noticed because it requires too much work. But anyone who also has the other two things besides the bowl, he can climb the coconut palms, cut the blossom stalk, fasten a bowl to it, and thus procure for himself the fortifying palm wine. This gives him a chance to struggle through until better times come.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_909_FmTrukL] Islanders relied on crabs and bitter yams in times of famine: 'When fishing is unsuccessful due to unfavorable weather, famine prevails in the huts of the Kanakas, and many a person is hungry and mournfully hangs his head. Others,on the other hand, who are more courageous, roam through the mangrove swamps for mussels or look for crabs in the crab holes on the shore. As bait they hold a fern frond in the crab hole. When the crab seizes the fern with its claws, they quickly pull it out. The natives know very well how to grasp the animal in such a manner that they cannot be pinched by the claws.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_910_FmTrukL] 'Yam The yam (Dioscorea sp.), termed eep, is rarely used as a food. According to informant Kekkin on Romonum, this plant was formerly cultivated. The bitter yam, Dioscorea bulbifera, grows wild and is used only as a famine food.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_911_FmTrukL] LeBar mentions other 'famine foods': 'Marginal, or famine, foods including: heart of palm (eeryk), Dioscorea bulbifera (pwereka), Ipomoea gracilis (ruke), Ficus tinctoria (jöwöön), Ipomoea digitata (jeteniten).' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_912_FmTrukL] According to Mahony, Cyrtosperma was stored in swamps for use in times of famine: 'A large number of varieties of Colocasia and Cyrtosperma are recognized but there are only a few varieties of Alocasia, one of which is never eaten. Varieties are classified on the basis of their color, whether or not they have thorns and if so whether many or few, how fast they mature, how large the corm grows and what its consistency and taste are like after being cooked. Almost all of the Colocasia varieties mature in about six months or so. Many of the older varieties of Cyrtosperma take at least three years to mature. Some varieties, such as simiten, are reported to mature in little more than a year. Many of these early maturing varieties are recent introductions but they are very popular, have become quite widespread and are frequently planted. One early maturing variety whose name, six months ( sikismont) is an English translation of the Ponapean name ( sowunpwong wennew), was introduced to Lukunor years ago by a couple of men who worked on a sailing vessel which stopped at Ponape and heighboring islands. It is apparently grown only on Lukunor and a few neighboring islands. However, the magic [Page 95] of its name has gained for it a wide reputation and many people would like to try it out. This variety would be extensively propagated if it were made available, though some might be disappointed since it does not quite live up to its name, taking a year, sometimes a little less than a year, to grow to maturity. In regard to Cyrtosperma, the tasty, rapidly maturing varieties are the most highly desired but they seem to be less hardy. In former times, people used to keep a reserve supply of the hardier but less tasty varieties of Cyrtosperma in the swamps for use in times of famine. This is no longer being done so the hardier varieties are not so frequently propagated.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_913_FmTrukL] It is unclear from Mahony's description whether these supplies had a communal character or were only used by individual families. We have provisionally assumed the latter. Expert confirmation is needed on the matter. So far, we have found no evidence on famine relief mesasures undertaken by the colonial administration.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ provision of famine relief ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Food storage ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> According to SCCS variable 20 'Food Storage' 'Individual households', not 'Communal facilities', 'Political agent controlled repositories', or 'Economic agent controlled repositories' were present, coded in the SCCS as ‘2’. Bollig and Goodenough describe the fermentation of breadfruit: 'Truk’s small land area and limited animal resources force its inhabitants to rely for food almost exclusively on vegetable and marine resources. The staple food is supplied by the breadfruit tree, which is well suited to the steep slopes, its roots preventing soil erosion. Since it provides a seasonal crop, breadfruit is stored and fermented in pits for the lean period, when the diet is further supplemented with taro, sweet potatoes, and manioc.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_914_FmTrukL] 'Since the breadfruit tree does not bear throughout the year, the natives must preserve the surplus so that it, together with the yields from the plantings, will help them through to the next breadfruit harvest. In this period of preserving, all the men and boys are busy with picking ( amomo). With baskets and the iass (picker) they set out in order to relieve the trees of their burden. All the fruit is heaped up in piles at a certain place. A funnel-shaped pit ( nas) has been dug out there and lined with banana leaves. The shell of the fruit is scraped out with a tiger shell ( [unknown]i[unknown]i), which is ground like a plane, the core is cut out, the fruit split into pieces and thrown into the pit. The whole is covered with banana leaves and grass and weighted with large stones. Some time later the fruit begins to ferment, and a yellowish-white mass is formed, which smells sourish.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_915_FmTrukL] 'All kinds of breadfruit are preserved together on Truk. On other islands they are carefully sorted out, whereby better apot, mar (name of the preserved food) is supposed to be produced. A mar contains hundreds, even thousands, of fruits. If one considers that each family makes several nas for the lean months, it is clear that one tree cannot feed a family. The apot keeps for years. If more is made in the following year, it [Page 161] is mixed with the old, which is thereby improved. It must be hard to digest, however, since some get a stomachache from eating it. Even at a long distance one can smell the nas, and the breath of those who have eaten apot. For the majority of the natives it is a delicacy. In their “cookbook” there are many recipes for its preparation. They mix it with grated coconut or coconut milk, or knead it in sea water is order to kill the smell somewhat ( marepupu). These recipes, however, are used only on better occasions. Usually it is baked as it comes from the pit.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_916_FmTrukL] Fish and other sea animals were roasted and stored in baskets: 'The Truk people still must usually have animal food to accompany the vegetable main dish, or else it will not slide down. The accompanying food is usually fish. The preparation of the fish is a matter for the women and girls, who perform their task with skill and intelligence, although the procedure is a little dirty. The larger fish, with scales and entrails, are simply put on the open fire; the smaller ones, several at a time, are first wrapped in a breadfruit leaf. The fact that, in addition, the cook spits into the fire or blows her nose in it does not spoil the appetite of any true Trukese. During the work she must very carefully watch the animals wandering about, for whatever animals the hut shelters prowl around the fire in order to grab something. Depending upon the circumstances, mussels, cray-fish, and other sea animals are added to the fish on the open fire. After the work is finished, everything roasted is put into the food baskets hanging from the roof, out of which it is then taken as needed. After a very short time under the tropical sun the animals begin to smell. But though the smell may be ever so strong, no Truk native will throw away a good bite on account of it. One does not hear anything about illnesses as a consequence of eating such food. They seem to be completely immune.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_917_FmTrukL] We have assumed that stored fish and breadfruit served individual families and domestic units rather than villages or even lineages. This remains in need of confirmation. According to Mahony, Cyrtosperma was stored in swamps for use in times of famine: 'A large number of varieties of Colocasia and Cyrtosperma are recognized but there are only a few varieties of Alocasia, one of which is never eaten.

They included spirit mediums, breadfruit summoners, fish summoners, healers, masters of spells, masters of sorcery, builders, navigators, diviners, and most importantly the masters of magic and ritual relating to war and politics. Their knowledge was private property passed down to their children and junior lineage mates.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_921_FmTrukL] 'Major ceremonies were those associated with death, communicating with good souls of the dead, summoning breadfruit, and making food presentations to chiefs. Ritual was also associated with divination, curing, warfare, political meetings, house building, and courtship.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_922_FmTrukL] Medicines were associated with the agency of spirits: 'In traditional belief, spirit beings were widely distributed in the sky, under the sea, and on land. The important places among spirit lands in the sky were: a region under the dome of Heaven, home of the gods who could take human form; a region in the south from which came all the plant and marine life that gave people food; and a region named 'Achaw' or 'Kachaw,' abode of the ancestors of many Chuukese clans and particularly of the clans associated with the chiefship and the special bodies of magical lore from which chiefly power derived. Spirits could accomplish their intentions at will and were thus the source of all that was MANAMAN (mana), such as efficacious spells, medicines, and rituals. Good souls of the dead were consulted through mediums. The Chuukese also invoked in spells the spirits inhabiting the dome of Heaven, presided over by 'Great Spirit,' and the spirits associated with particular crafts and major bodies of lore.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_923_FmTrukL] Diviners, Healers, and Mediums were involved in the treatment of illness: 'Sickness was believed to result from the 'bite' of a malevolent spirit, or of any other spirit one had offended or that was controlled by a ritual specialist one had offended or by a sorcerer. Sickness might also result from soul loss. In all but the latter case, treatment involved the use of medicines to be applied externally, to be drunk, or to be inhaled. For soul loss, a spirit medium was consulted to help find and restore the soul. Divination was used as a diagnostic aid in cases of severe or prolonged illness. Massage was used to treat bruises, local infections, and muscle ailments.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_924_FmTrukL] Knowledge of divination was considered incorporeal property: 'There are systems of knowledge which are subject to special rules of their own. [Page 56] For example, to learn knot divination a pupil must pay the diviner ( sowupwe) even if the latter is his own father or mother’s brother. An jitag (a sort of lawyer, general, diplomat and orator all rolled into one, who occupies the most prestigeful position in Trukese society) is alleged never to teach his own children as much as he teaches his sister’s children. This contention does not, however, appear to be supported by the genealogical connections of the past jitag of Romonum Island. Despite special rules governing specific forms of incorporeal property, their over-all organization is analogous to that of corporeal property and does not require a new conceptual framework to make them intelligible.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_925_FmTrukL] Spirit mediums relied on the experience of possession rather than a transmitted system of knowledge: 'All religious practitioners as well as craftsmen and magicians are owners of the knowledge necessary to exercise their specialties. The Trukese make no distinction between them and other skilled personnel. There is one important exception to this rule, the spirit medium ( wäättwa or wään ëny). His (or her) position is not based on knowledge so much as on having been possessed by a spirit. This spirit is in no way classed as the medium’s property, nor can it be inherited automatically by a son or lineage mate. The position of a spirit medium, therefore, is different from that of a property holder, except as he uses his abilities to diagnose illness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_926_FmTrukL] Public health infrastructures on Chuuk were introduced in the colonial period. Mahony describes the public health infrastructure as it existed in the post-colonial period: 'Hospital medicine may be sought directly from a health aide at the local dispensary, or, if some way can be found to get there, at the District Hospital on Moen Island. Occasionally a missionary, a Peace Corps Volunteer, or some other Westerner present in the community may serve as a source of hospital medicine. In any event, when hospital medicine is sought, the patient and his relatives need only make a determination about the kinds of symptoms present.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_927_FmTrukL] 'Nowadays health services are delivered to people living in the Truk Lagoon in two major ways: through the local dispensary on each island or municipality and through the District Hospital on Moen Island with its associated Public Health Office, which handles immunizations and prenatal and well-baby clinics. All of these services are administered by a District Director of Public Health, at present a Trukese medical practitioner. As an official of the Trust Territory government, he receives technical supervision from the Public Health Director attached to the High Commissioner’s Headquarters staff on Saipan. The District Director of Public Health is assisted by other medical practitioners, all graduates of the Fiji School of Medicine, which gives five years of training but does not award a full M.D. degree. These practitioners may be assisted from time to time by a fully licensed physician. These personnel and facilities service the 27,000 people of the Truk District, which includes Truk Atoll and a number of other islands and atolls to the west and south of Truk.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_928_FmTrukL] 'The most readily available source of ‘hospital medicine’ for Pis and Fano Islanders, and most others in the Truk District, is the local dispensary (also called piiuiig) manned by a local health aide. For the most part the treatment given is symptomatic, and there is virtually no attempt at diagnosis. It could hardly be otherwise since the health aides have minimal training and very little in the way of facilities. None of the health aides in the Truk District has had the equivalent of a High School education; in fact, many have had no formal schooling whatsoever. All, however, have had from six months to one year of in-service training through working at the District Hospital, plus occasional refresher training at the same hospital.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_929_FmTrukL] 'These health aides dispense medicines out of a small stock of remedies kept in a closet in their homes or the shack that serves as local dispensary. They administer broad spectrum antibiotics for various complaints, apply ointments, salves, and dressings; dispense worm pills and aspirin; and dole out liberal amounts of cough syrup and nose drops. Although the desires or needs of individual patients are occasionally met satisfactorily, and while there are practically no outspoken complaints, the general level of satisfaction with these services can safely be said to be very low.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_930_FmTrukL] 'The next normal outlet where ‘hospital medicine’ can be sought is at the hospital on Moen Island. Patients sometimes face difficult problems in obtaining transportation to Moen, and arranging for food and lodging while there. If these problems can be overcome, patients must frequently wait for hours at the out-patient clinic before being examined. The number of out-patients ranges from 85 to over 100 per day, and there is only one Micronesian medical practitioner on duty from 8:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. to handle this patient load.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_931_FmTrukL] However, according to Fischer, Chuukese continued to practice 'native' forms of medicine even when taking advantage of colonial hospitals: 'Sickness: In almost every house in which there is a young child will also be found medicines to protect him from various illness caused by the [Page 98] supernaturals. Sick babies will be taken to the American hospital only if the parents are above average as far as acculturation goes, and if the hospital is within a convenient distance from the home. On Romonum the hospital is much too inconveniently situated, ten miles away across the lagoon on Moen, to make taking babies who are other than at death’s door feasible. Even in this case, the faith in Trukese medicine is often so great that it is felt that nothing can save the child if Trukese medicine fails. American doctors, getting only severe cases from long distances, are at a disadvantage in establishing faith in American medicine. One child, who had a badly swollen eye, with one side of his mouth and face also infected, was taken to the hospital by a reluctant parent, when urged by the anthropologist, only after Trukese medicines had failed to relieve the child in a two-week trial. After a few days under penicillin treatment in the hospital, the child return with all signs of the swelling gone. His parents brought a gift of food to the anthropologist in gratitude. To illustrate how difficult it is to convince a people of the fallacy of their own ways of medication, the adopted mother of this same child had an advanced and very painful case of venereal disease which she refused to have treated in the hospital, and submitted only as treatment by a Trukese woman who was reported to have very strong venereal medicine.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_932_FmTrukL] 'Even those who will bring their children to the hospital, and undergo the hardship of having to remain in confinement with them, are in general not secure enough in their belief in the American medicine to abandon their own treatment. Thus, many children, who are also taking medicine from the hospital, will have a black, tar-like substance spotted over their bodies and will be having bundles of Trukese medicine soaked in water and the water subsequently poured over their heads.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_933_FmTrukL] We need to confirm when hospitals and clinincs became commonplace and add a transition date.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Control of infectious disease ♣ present ♥</b> Gladwin and Mahony describe a number of vaccination efforts undertaken by successive colonial administrations: 'Disease can never be avoided but with the exception of tuberculosis, which is apparently recent in the area and takes a serious toll, there are no diseases which could be called menacing. Smallpox was quite a killer between its introduction in the last century and the beginning of vaccination under the Japanese, but is now virtually unknown. The anopheles mosquito is not present, so there is no malaria; amebic dysentery exists, but probably because water is not drunk from the springs is never epidemic. Even syphilis is interdicted by the closely related skin disease yaws, although it is interesting and disturbing to speculate upon the possible consequences of the eradication of yaws (through the use of penicillin by the American administration) upon the resistance to syphilis of the rising generations.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_934_FmTrukL] 'Other infectious diseases which have sometimes occurred in epidemic proportions in recent years include measles (rubeola), German measles, whooping cough (pertussis) and poliomyelitis. It should be noted that the Trust Territory administration in 1964 launched a mass immunization program for smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, typhoid and paratyphoid fever. This program is beginning to provide protection against some of the more serious epidemic diseases.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_935_FmTrukL]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Care of war invalids/veterans ♣ absent ♥</b> We have found no material on care of war invalids. While the Japanese administration certainly provided services to its own soldiers during WW II, we are unsure whether Chuukese individuals benefitted from this.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Care of orphans ♣ absent ♥</b> Orphans were taken in by the extend family rather than cared for within a public health framework: 'The cooperative extended family is responsible for the provision of material wealth for its members. This family has in the past consisted of a group of own sisters, their spouses, their daughters, married and unmarried, and their unmarried sons and brothers, residing matrilocally. Today, the demise of the large family house has sometimes led to [Page 19] a grouping of sisters’ houses around a common family hearth. In other cases today, where it is more economically beneficial, married couples will reside patrilocally, while still others will set up nuclear family households. Families will often gain additional recruits from various sources such as teen-age children, dissatisfied with treatment in their own homes, who may be taken in as a pwipwi (sibling of the same sex) by some member of the family who happens to take a temporary or permanent liking to them, or among orphans and their spouses if they are still too young to set up households of their own at the time they are left without families. Cooperation for the benefit of the family extends outside this unit but within this unit it is more rigidly regulated. Other units formed for procuring biologic necessities are informal, transitory and voluntary except for those associated with the public welfare. In this last instance the chief generally assigns certain quantities of work to each family unit, who may in turn apportion it among their members as they see fit. This is done in the case of food for feasts, building of public works, etc.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_936_FmTrukL] Orphaned infants were fed by related women or neighbours: 'The feeding of the child is primarily a matter for the mother. But other women in the house do not hesitate to help the mother in the nursing. One can see children who have been able to walk and talk for a long time and are still suckled. The European feeding-bottle has also successfully made a way for itself and is filled with goat’s milk or condensed milk. If the mother of a suckling dies or if she cannot feed it enough, it is lost in most cases. The women try to feed it with curcuma or chew sugar cane which the little one must suck from their lips, but it is not much use. On the whole mortality is high among the little children of Truk. Many die from intestinal catarrh, fevers, and misery.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_937_FmTrukL] So far, we have found no material on colonial orphanages.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Care of elderly ♣ absent ♥</b> The elderly were taken care of within the family: 'In Truk it makes expecially good economic sense to produce at least one child. Parents want children in order to have someone to care for them in old age and to have someone to help with their work. The love of children and of relatives is expressed as based on mutual dependence, and feelings of independence are repressed.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_938_FmTrukL] According to Fischer, treatment of the elderly differed according to gender: 'The old man and woman (the chiinn&amp;aunknown;p): After the female passes the menopause she is considered to be an old woman. This is the period of her life of which she is most afraid. If she has had no children and becomes too weak to work she becomes an unwelcome burden upon her more distant relatives. If she has children her status depends somewhat upon how much her children love her. This frequently turns out to be much less than she would expect. If she has grandchildren she may become useful as a baby sitter, while the younger woman works, but more frequently she is expected to provide what food and care she can for the pregnant daughter or daughter-in-law or for the same woman if she has a young child. It is not uncommon for her to be beaten by her own children. Her attempts to keep the good will of others is shown in her changed attitude toward eating. When the anthropologist inquired from Amywo why his wife Aryko ate such a little bit of food and saved the best parts for him, he said, ‘Yes, she is just like an old woman in this. She just picks a little bit at her food and saves the rest for her relatives.’ All old women [Page 38] are not in this unenviable position. Some, especially those who have had large famililies, are secure among their many children, and are not much of a burden to any one of them. If they have gained the respect and love of their children they may be treated in something approaching the ideal manner for treatment of parents in this culture, which is that the parent has only to express a desire to have the children go to great lengths to achieve it for them. There are also certain superstitions associated with neglect of a duty to feed an older person. This is illustrated in Fyciko’s reaction to the following part of a dream: ‘Later I stayed at home and the mother of Siro and Rooke came - she is dead. She was eaten by a soope (ghost) in my dream. Afterwards I screamed loudly, but just a little noise came out because of the soope. Then the soope carried me to Siro’s mother. There was a house. Then Siro’s mother said to me ‘What are you doing?’ I said the soope had eaten me. Then the woman said she would make medicine and the soope wouldn’t eat me. She told me she would get a stick of fire because that was the medicine of the soope. I was very frightened because I thought I would be dead. Afterwards Eniina looked for me and asked the people of the house ‘Where is Fyciko?’ I said, ‘I am here.’ ‘What are you doing here?’ ‘Because a soope ate me, therefore I am here.’ Then she asked, ‘Which one ate you?’ I said, ‘The soul of your sister.’' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_939_FmTrukL] 'The old man is not quite so unfortunate as the old woman. No old man on Romonum had lost so much vigor that he was unable to work. Like the old woman, if he is able, he is expected to provide some food for his grandchildren and their mothers. Unlike the old woman, he is frequently [Page 40] a respected and important figure, who will be called upon for advice from his large store of wisdom. This is especially true if he has been a figure of importance in his youth. If he is weak he is supported by his children or relatives or friends. Young people are admonished to be nice to people because if they should be left alone in old age without children or other relatives, people will love them and will take them in and feed them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_940_FmTrukL] Bolling claims that elderly persons without support networks were left to fend for themselves: 'From the above statements one sees that the lot of the sick is on the average good among the natives; to be sure, the Kanaka is not overindulged either. Only the fate of old, sick people who no longer have any close relatives or are afflicted with a contagious illness is not enviable. They are left in dirt and excrement and lie without care. Someone will barely condescend to give them anything to eat and drink. On trips I often found dying persons, without food, without clothing, who were treated simply like a mangy animal. In heathendom love does not extend very far. Those natives who do not belong to the family of a sick person, generally take no notice of him and do not even visit him; at most one makes the malicious remark: “ deiwet e bue le pa, it serves him right, he will die.” To be sure, the family of the Kanaka does not want any strange visitors, out of fear of evil sorcery.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_941_FmTrukL] So far, we have found no material on colonial systems of care for the elderly.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> In the period immediately preceding colonization, the Chuuk Islands were not governed by a state. Instead, the Chuukese/Trukese were divided into multiple clans and lineages sharing resources: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_942_FmTrukL] 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_943_FmTrukL] District chiefs were chosen from the dominant lineage of an area: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_944_FmTrukL] 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_945_FmTrukL] Traditionally, authority did not extend beyond the atoll and was shared among multiple chiefs on one island. Chuuk was somewhat more fragmented than other Micronesian societies: 'Throughout most of Micronesia the maximum independent autonomous political unit was the high island or the atoll, often subdivided into more than one polity. At the time of European contact, Satawan Atoll in the Mortlocks had four separate communities, each with its own leader, which sometimes fought one another. Palau had two confederations of villages or districts, each independent of the other, and the villages themselves had considerable autonomy. Pohnpei had five petty states, although traditions of a unified rule for the whole island are apparent from an earlier period. Chuuk was extremely fragmented politically, with several independent communities on each of the six larger high islands. The Marshalls and the Gilberts had larger polities and integrated groups of separate atolls under a high chief; these expansionist states achieved their fullest development after the introduction of firearms by Europeans.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_946_FmTrukL] Accordingly, we can not assume a system of state pensions for elites prior to colonization. The political structure changed with the advent of colonization, when an administrative infrastructure was introduced by the colonial powers: 'Japan replaced Germany as the ruling power in World War I and was in turn replaced by the United States under United Nations Trusteeship in 1945. In 1986 Chuuk and its surrounding atolls became a state within the newly independent Federated States of Micronesia. Protestant missionaries and traders came in the 1880s and Roman Catholic missionaries after 1900. Japan sought to develop Chuuk economically and introduced elementary education in Japanese. Education was much expanded under American administration, and many Chuukese learned English. Some went to college in Guam, Hawaii, and the United States mainland. The American administration introduced representative government.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_947_FmTrukL] Government chiefs (those tolerated by colonial powers) received a share in the taxes they collected for the government: 'Upon the delivery of the head tax the chiefs were given a few marks back from the German government as gratification. All in all the chief’s office is not a position which can make the possessor rich. It is understandable if the chief further bleeds his people somewhat on the side, especially since often enough he must draw on his purse in their behalf. If two families quarrel on account of something and the one must pay compensation, it is advanced by the chief if the family cannot pay. If someone from a foreign tribe has a claim on a member of his tribe, the chief is responsible for it. All creditors depend on him. Afterwards he can see to getting it back from the debtors. It is strange that the chief is even obliged to distribute gifts here and there. If he sees that one of his people is stirred up about something and he fears disagreeable /118/ scenes, he calms him with little gifts. [Page 129] He knows from experience that the subjects are able to annoy the chief more than he them.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_948_FmTrukL] We are unsure whether government chiefs received pensions as well. However, we have assumed that native petty officials were compensated in the form of a state salary. Accordingly, it might be possible that they also received a modest pension after retirement. More information is needed on the matter. We have provisionally coded 'inferred absent', but this is open to review.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ State pensions for non-elites ♣ absent ♥</b> See above.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Entertainment_and_Knowledge_Well-Being">Entertainment and Knowledge Well-Being</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=FmTrukL&amp;action=edit&amp;section=75" title="Edit section: Entertainment and Knowledge Well-Being">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> Islanders prepared food for feasts held by chiefs: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_949_FmTrukL] Bollig describes the preparations for a festival: 'Both develop a feverish activity. The men prepare whole mountains of food. Whatever is found in the plantings is dragged out. The women too get no rest. They are constantly squatting in the water in order to snatch at a little tail. If the supplies of their own tribe are not sufficient, friends on other islands have [Page 201] to help out, for which equal help is given to them in a similar situation. There is movement on all roads on the morning of the fadanap day, for no Kanaka wants to be absent when there is something to chew. All are loaded with bananas, pineapples, sugar cane, coconuts, and fish, which they carry to the chief’s house, where everything is piled up. Very rich ones also bring such European goods as rice, biscuits, salmon; indeed, even beer and liquor could not be lacking in Japanese times. The most festive moment is the bringing of the large madün bowls. Cautiously they come rocking along, carried on the shoulders of strong men. The carriers are painted, /183/ adorned, and sing their emoir. When the fadanap participants are in two parties, they approach from different sides, singing to each other. But usually one tribe or the other takes it badly, since ancient hostility prevails among all the tribes. They quarrel with each other, throw food at their heads, and not infrequently bring knives and spears into play.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_950_FmTrukL] 'A dance festival ( pine) in a village is a happy event, not only for the village itself, but for the whole region. Practicing goes on untiringly for weeks and months beforehand. The dance tunes resound from the shore until late into the night. The closer the day comes, the greater the zeal. Everybody is on their feet. Great quantities of food must be prepared, whole baskets of fish will be roasted, so that the stomach will not come out short either. Some dancers travel around to the neighboring islands and beg for dancing jewelry from friends and acquaintances in order to be able to shine properly. On the morning of the day of the dance they come streaming from all sides, by land, by water, dancer and spectator, their /176/ dance adornment in little baskets. Gay activity increases in front of the dance house. In the huts, under the coconut palms, everywhere unembarrassed toilettes are being made. Mothers paint their stark naked little ones. How happily their little eyes shine, because today they will look beautiful. The adults help each other. Here a woman rubs her husband, there the sister her brother, from head to foot. The people as a whole are a yellow mass. The neck is decked out with faupar, wreaths of flowers. Bands of faupar are wound around arms and legs. The men wear on their heads the mätaritu, the thick, yellow dance wreath made of coconut fibers, and, in addition, enormous wooden combs with bird’s feathers, indeed, whole wings.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_951_FmTrukL] 'The women and girls wear freshly colored hip mats; their arms are adorned with tortoise-shell rings, on the head sits a wreath made of four precious tortoise-shell rings. What one individual has on his body in the way of adornment amounts to hundreds of marks. A happy, festive mood prevails on the dance place. The dancers stand to one side. One recognizes them by the rich adornment and the ubud which they have wound around their hips. They hold one more brief dress rehearsal in order to see whether everything goes well. Then the shell resounds. Everybody rushes into the dance house in order to gain a good place. The rows of dancers sit on the floor gravely and ceremoniously. It is an important day.'

Some of these grounds were large enough for baseball fields. Baseball became quite popular in Truk in Japanese times and English baseball terms are still pronounced in a Trukese modification of a Japanese accent by the men who attended Japanese schools.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_953_FmTrukL] 'The fact of daily association and residential proximity puts the members of a community in a position where they are most likely to call upon one another rather than strangers for assistance in the many little tasks that come up where an extra hand or two may be needed, as, for example, in launching a canoe. The members of a community tend, therefore, to be more or less obligated ( kinessëw) to one another in informal matters as well as in more formal property relationships. Similarly, recreational activities frequently involve the entire community membership. Dancing appears to have been [Page 147] the most important activities of this kind in aboriginal times, but under the influence of missionaries it has come to be considered sinful and no longer serves this purpose. Its place has been taken by baseball, a sport introduced by the Japanese. When services are over, every Sunday on Romonum is devoted to baseball in which the entire population participates as players or spectators. Many communities are now split into Catholic and Protestant congregations, but the indications are that in former times participation in religious ceremonies was largely a community affair.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_954_FmTrukL] We have assumed no recreational facilities of this kind prior to Japanese rule.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ritual buildings/spaces ♣ absent ♥</b> Feasts and other ceremonial events were held at meeting-houses, but meeting-houses served a variety of other functions as well: 'A large and important lineage might have a meeting house, wuut. In some districts only the chief’s lineage has one; in others only the well established lineages. At one time or another every lineage on Romonum has had its own wuut. When a man’s lineage is without a meeting house, he attends that of his father’s or his wife’s lineage.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_955_FmTrukL] 'Under aboriginal conditions a lineage’s wuut was not necessarily located near its jimw. It frequently stood by the shore, where it served as a canoe house ( wutten waa) as well as a meeting house ( wutten mwiic). A meeting house was not in itself taboo to women, although normally they did not enter it if men other than their husbands were present. Both men and women, however, could be present together at such feasts and dances as did not exclude one sex and were held in the meeting house. During certain ceremonies, men kept away from the meeting house and it was used exclusively by women. The women of a lineage could hold meetings of their own in its wuut.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_956_FmTrukL] 'Its wuut was the place where the unmarried young men of a lineage slept. Its older men, and at times the husbands of its women, also slept there whenever they were observing important sexual taboos. A meeting house was the lounging place for men during the evening, where they visited and told stories. In it visitors from other islands and districts were received, entertained, and put up for the night.' ref&gt;Goodenough, Ward Hunt 1951. “Property, Kin, And Community On Truk”, 68&lt;/ref&gt; 'All the old lineage meeting houses of Romonum are gone today. All over Truk, however, every district still maintains at least one meeting house. Women enter them more freely now than they used to, because the unmarried men no longer sleep there. The latter now go to sleep in the houses of non-taboo relatives. Several unmarried men may together occupy a small hut for sleeping purposes, the hut being built in the style of an jimw rather than of an wuut. The district meeting house is still the place where the men sleep before a ball game or track meet. Guests are still entertained there, and it still is the place for feasts and district meetings. All local governmental functions are carried on in the district wuut.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_957_FmTrukL] Regional ceremonial centres were present until the 18th century, but were abandoned in the immediate pre-colonial period: 'I mention the foregoing in order to show that the present political and learned traditions of Truk derive from a set of older institutions, which they still echo. These institutions involved the political domination of Truk by a presumably immigrant clan whose patron god was Sowukachaw, for whom a shrine was maintained on Achaw Peak, the spiritual seat and source of supernatural power of that dominant clan. A dual system of titles, perhaps not unlike that in Ponape, may have been a feature of the organization of rank and authority, providing the basis for a subsequent division of Truk into the rival political and magico-religious leagues of immediate precolonial times. Truk and Ponape were not the only places in Micronesia to have a cult that associated kingship or high chiefship with a thunder god and basaltic stone. Mention has already been made of the sacred basaltic stones at Nan Moadol on Ponape and the association of one of them with the god of thunder. Basaltic peaks on Ponape were spirit places, and basaltic monoliths the abodes of spirits. This association of basalt with spirits appears [Page 561] even in the Marshall Islands. On Namu and Aur atolls, there were shrines with basaltic stones on them at the places of origin of the clans of paramount chiefs (Finsch 1893:396). The one on Namu, thrown into the sea by a zealous missionary, embodied a clan’s founder (Pollock 1977; Erdland 1914:345); and according to Erdland (1914:343), the totem of the high chiefly clan on Ebon was the thunder, Läköta (‘Sir Cloud’, see ļa- and kōd¸o in Abo et al. 1976). From Ngatik, near Ponape, the Bishop Museum has in its possession an old photograph of an altar. On top of it, according to a notation, is the “stone god,” from its appearance a block of basalt.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_958_FmTrukL] 'A high island, such as Kosrae or Ponape, clearly had to be the source of the basaltic stones in the atolls. But those who carried them and who introduced the cult had to be seafarers, and the seafarers, we have seen, were the atoll dwellers in Micronesia. Kosrae was obviously visited by Marshall Islanders, for the names of a number of places in the Marshalls were known in Kosrae (Sarfert 1919-20:218, 224). It is tempting to consider it the source of the basalt in Namu and Aur. But the Ponapean tradition that people from Namu were in some way associated with Isohkelekel, including mention of their clan name (Fischer, Riesenberg, and Whiting 1977:68, n. 22), makes it more likely that the basalt and the cult were brought to the Marshalls by Marshallese adventurers returning from Ponape.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_959_FmTrukL] Accordingly, we have assumed that their archeological remains did not serve ceremonial functions in the pre-colonial period. Missionaries were active in the colonial period: 'By the middle of the twentieth century all of Chuuk's people were at least nominally Christian, either Protestant or Catholic, and Christianity had become the focus of religious life.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_960_FmTrukL] 'The main island is Toloas. On it lie: the government station (Witetun), the main station of the Catholic ( O[unknown]omenau) and of the Protestant ( Kutua) missions. The landmark of Poloas is the legendary mountain of Tolemuan (peak of the man). The small island of Eten, on which was to be found the seat of the Jaluit Company, is also under the head chief of Toloas.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_961_FmTrukL] 'Before the Spanish Government had gained sufficient influence in the islands, the people of Truk lived under the rule of numerous petty chiefs who were constantly engaging in inter-district and inter-island warfare. In Spanish and German times, Catholic and Protestant missionaries Christianized and subdued the warlike tendencies of the population, but many of the old suspicious attitudes still show in present-day culture patterns. The numbers of Spanish and Germans who came to Truk at any one time were relatively small; they left their mark on the people in the folklore, in the religion and in the alphabet which they applied to the Trukese language, teaching the people to read and write. It was left to the Japanese to make the most impression on the native economy.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_962_FmTrukL] As a result of missionary activities, Christianity spread quickly in the 20th century: 'After 1900 Christianity became well established in most major centres in Micronesia. For the most part, traditional religions ceased being practiced in their full original form, although in Yap and some atolls of the central Carolines, traditional religion continued to be practiced until the middle of the 20th century. Missionaries and travelers recorded descriptions of certain aspects of the island religions, but there is no complete and systematic account.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_963_FmTrukL] We have assumed that Christian missionaries also constructed churches. However, we are unsure as to the extent of church construction prior to the Japanese period. We have provisionally coded 'absent', but this is open to review.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Other ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ accessibility of entertainment buildings ♣ general population ♥</b> We have assumed that sports facilities associated with schools were accessible to the general population.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Full-time entertainment specialists ♣ absent ♥</b> Islanders performed poetry and storytelling: 'Performing arts included dancing, storytelling, playing the noseflute and bamboo Jew's harp (in courtship serenading), singing, and poetry and rhetoric. Other arts were associated with tattooing, woodworking, weaving, and warfare.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_964_FmTrukL] Goodenough describes oral traditions that cover myth and past migrations (see also 'general variables' for material about Chuukese prehistory): 'IN THE ORAL HISTORY OF TRUK AND PONAPE in the Caroline Islands of Micronesia (see Figure 1), a place called Kachaw is the source of some clan ancestors and, especially, of politically important immigrants. Kachaw also appears as a place in Carolinian navigational lore. Until very recently, at least, most Micronesian scholars have accepted as fact that Kachaw is the island of Kosrae (Kusaie), situated about 560 km east southeast of Ponape. This identification has led to historical inferences about the role of Kosrae in Ponapean and Trukese prehistory. Critical examination of the linguistic and contextual evidence, however, indicates that in traditional Micronesian lore Kachaw referred to something quite different, namely the sky or a region of sky. It is as such that Kachaw was important in Trukese and Ponapean cosmology, religion, and legends of origin. Before I develop this argument, let me summarize how Kachaw is talked about in Trukese and Ponapean lore.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_965_FmTrukL] We have assumed that performing arts and oral traditions were transmitted by the community as a whole and performed on a part-time rather than full-time basis. This remains in need of confirmation.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ status of full-time entertainment specialists ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Access to education ♣ all people ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Publicly funded or subsidized education ♣ absent: 1886-1914 CE; present: 1915-1948 CE ♥</b> Religious and ritual knowledge was transmitted by ritual specialists to their adepts and kin rather than publicly funded and organized: 'Ritual practices were conducted by their own specialists. They included spirit mediums, breadfruit summoners, fish summoners, healers, masters of spells, masters of sorcery, builders, navigators, diviners, and most importantly the masters of magic and ritual relating to war and politics. Their knowledge was private property passed down to their children and junior lineage mates.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_966_FmTrukL] 'Major ceremonies were those associated with death, communicating with good souls of the dead, summoning breadfruit, and making food presentations to chiefs. Ritual was also associated with divination, curing, warfare, political meetings, house building, and courtship.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_967_FmTrukL] Diviners accepted payments from apprentices (often kin) in exchange for secret knowledge: 'There are systems of knowledge which are subject to special rules of their own. [Page 56] For example, to learn knot divination a pupil must pay the diviner ( sowupwe) even if the latter is his own father or mother’s brother. An jitag (a sort of lawyer, general, diplomat and orator all rolled into one, who occupies the most prestigeful position in Trukese society) is alleged never to teach his own children as much as he teaches his sister’s children. This contention does not, however, appear to be supported by the genealogical connections of the past jitag of Romonum Island. Despite special rules governing specific forms of incorporeal property, their over-all organization is analogous to that of corporeal property and does not require a new conceptual framework to make them intelligible.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_968_FmTrukL] Spirit mediums were an exception to this rule, as their expertise did not rely on knowledge per se: 'All religious practitioners as well as craftsmen and magicians are owners of the knowledge necessary to exercise their specialties. The Trukese make no distinction between them and other skilled personnel. There is one important exception to this rule, the spirit medium ( wäättwa or wään ëny). His (or her) position is not based on knowledge so much as on having been possessed by a spirit. This spirit is in no way classed as the medium’s property, nor can it be inherited automatically by a son or lineage mate. The position of a spirit medium, therefore, is different from that of a property holder, except as he uses his abilities to diagnose illness.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_969_FmTrukL] Public schooling (elementary schools) was introduced by the Japanese colonial administration: 'Japan replaced Germany as the ruling power in World War I and was in turn replaced by the United States under United Nations Trusteeship in 1945. In 1986 Chuuk and its surrounding atolls became a state within the newly independent Federated States of Micronesia. Protestant missionaries and traders came in the 1880s and Roman Catholic missionaries after 1900. Japan sought to develop Chuuk economically and introduced elementary education in Japanese. Education was much expanded under American administration, and many Chuukese learned English. Some went to college in Guam, Hawaii, and the United States mainland. The American administration introduced representative government.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_970_FmTrukL] 'The Japanese administration followed a policy of starting their educational and other socio-economic programs for the natives at the district centers and spreading outwards. The government school system for natives was initiated by establishing a three-year elementary school near the district administrative center on Dublon Island. This school was staffed by Japanese male teachers with Trukese assistants. The latter at first served as interpreters and helped with the discipline. Students were selected on a quota basis from the various islands of the lagoon. Apparently only boys were selected at first, although girls were soon added.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_971_FmTrukL] 'Eventually other three-year elementary schools were established on the other large islands of the lagoon and on one of the Mortlock Islands, a group of atolls to the south of Truk, while a higher elementary school of two additional grades was established at the district center on Dublon Island for selected graduates of the lower schools. Lower school attendance was then made compulsory within Truk Lagoon.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_972_FmTrukL] Some trade schools were also established: 'A further step on the educational ladder was eventually provided with the establishment of a trade school for carpenters at Koror, Palau, a thousand miles to the west. Promising graduates of the higher elementary schools were selected from all over the mandated territory to attend this school. Later a small agricultural school was established on Dublon Island, Truk, and, after the Japanese started to alienate “undeveloped” native land for colonization, a surveyor’s school was established in Palau.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_973_FmTrukL] Fischer provides a description of Japanese schools: 'The physical plant of the government schools consisted of the school building itself (classrooms and storerooms), and quarters nearby for the teacher or teachers. The school buildings were designed and built by the Japanese government, although native contributions of building sites and labor were evidently sometimes encouraged. The school buildings were of substantial construction; more substantial, one might argue, than was needed in the mild climate of Truk.'

Economic and educational 'development' was interrupted during the World Wars: 'While the militarization of Truk, which was to prove a disatrously inadequate bastion for the Japanese in the second World War, changed the emphasis of Japanese [Page 45] development of the islands, it served merely to accelerate the processes of change in the Trukese society initiated earlier by the economic development program which of course continued but on a lesser scale. But with the beginning of the air strikes against Truk in 1944, and the blockade which followed, the fruits of the Japanese efforts at economic development were destroyed and the necessity of supporting some 35,000 foreigners in addition to the almost 10,000 Trukese off the land resulted in a serious depletion of their resources. Intensive cultivation of sweet potatoes made unfit for use many acres of good gardening land, and the extensive use of explosives in fishing, as well as the underwater explosion of many aerial bombs and mines, depleted the fish population to an extent which is felt to the present day.

Officially language work was supposed to occupy half of the teaching time; arithmetic about a quarter; and miscellaneous subjects, such as gymnastic exercises, singing, handicraft, ethics, and geography, the remainder. According to reports of students the actual emphasis on the Japanese language was if anything even greater than this. While the official curriculum prescribed the teaching of the more common Chinese ideographs as well as the Japanese Kana syllabary, [Page 85] few, if any, native students could be said to be literate in Japanese to the extent of being able to read a newspaper by the end of fifth grade. Certainly none could read the regulations promulgated by the South Seas Government Office; and these regulations were not translated, except sometimes orally and in summary by rather confused native interpreters.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_991_FmTrukL] Christian missionaries taught writing in the native language: 'The Japanese schools did not try to teach reading or writing in the native language, although some Trukese learned these skills from the Western Protestant and Catholic missionaries.

The European feeding-bottle has also successfully made a way for itself and is filled with goat’s milk or condensed milk. If the mother of a suckling dies or if she cannot feed it enough, it is lost in most cases.

The main disease problems in Truk, as in the Trust Territory generally, are similar to those faced in many under-developed or developing areas.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_997_FmTrukL] 'Other infectious diseases which have sometimes occurred in epidemic proportions in recent years include measles (rubeola), German measles, whooping cough (pertussis) and poliomyelitis. It should be noted that the Trust Territory administration in 1964 launched a mass immunization program for smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, typhoid and paratyphoid fever. This program is beginning to provide protection against some of the more serious epidemic diseases.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_998_FmTrukL] Gladwin and Mahony disagree on the prevalence of tuberculosis in the colonial period: 'Disease can never be avoided but with the exception of tuberculosis, which is apparently recent in the area and takes a serious toll, there are no diseases which could be called menacing. Smallpox was quite a killer between its introduction in the last century and the beginning of vaccination under the Japanese, but is now virtually unknown. The anopheles mosquito is not present, so there is no malaria; amebic dysentery exists, but probably because water is not drunk from the springs is never epidemic.

The table shows that the hospital turned up only four cases of filariasis infection over a twelve-month period.

[Page 215] As long as the natives have sufficient fresh food, breadfruit, for example, the illness claims few victims. But as soon as they are forced to resort to apot, the number of dead increases tremendously. Since this apot is hard to digest, the sick develop violent stomach-aches and acute pains in the joints.

The table shows that the hospital turned up only four cases of filariasis infection over a twelve-month period. Despite this apparently low incidence, a survey of 600 Trukese in 1966 showed that 14% carried microfilariae in their bloodstreams indicating a fairly high prevalence.

This can be noticed even among small children. They are hardly half a year to a year old when sores break out over the whole body, especially on the lips, fingers, feet, and genital parts. The natives call it rub (frambesia). For some /195/ the body becomes one single boil. The sores disappear again after some time, only to break out anew here and there later on.

Vermination, which was brought in from the outside -- it is said from America -- has gained a firm footing on all the islands and cannot be driven out again on account of the unclean way of life of the people, although the German government has done everything that was in its power. [Page 215] As long as the natives have sufficient fresh food, breadfruit, for example, the illness claims few victims. But as soon as they are forced to resort to apot, the number of dead increases tremendously. Since this apot is hard to digest, the sick develop violent stomach-aches and acute pains in the joints. Some begin to tremble and feel cold over the entire body. They drag themselves about in the huts and become thinner and thinner.

During the period of U.S. administration after World War II, women’s clubs took root, spread slowly, and eventually helped “to raise the standard of living, to arouse interest in adult education and... [to play] an ever increasing and important role in providing community leadership” (U.S. Department of State 1963:83). In 1954, mothers had organized themselves in female parent-teacher groups in a few communities of the Trust Territory (U.S. Department of State 1954:70), and by the following year “a few women’s organizations [had] become active, particularly in the Palau and Ponape Districts, in promoting better child, home, and family care and in sponsoring community, social, and educational activities” (U.S. Department of State 1955:70). By 1962, the Trust Territory administration reported that “almost all districts now have local women’s interests officers,” although technically this was true for only three of the six districts, the others subsuming women’s interests under the responsibilities of community development officers (U.S. Department of State 1962:91, 1963:77). In Truk, for example, one of the first women graduates of Truk High School was sent to Hawaii for a six-month training program in commercial sewing at the Institute for Technical Interchange at the East-West Center, and upon her return to Truk she began working in the Community Development Office. Much of her advice to women’s groups away from Moen consisted of teaching them “how to cook and how to sew,” that is, in sharing her special training in home economics (Ibid.). By 1967, more than 60 women’s groups were organized in the Trust Territory, 5 in Truk District (U.S. Department of State 1967:91). Nearly all their activities were focused on women’s traditional domestic and family caretaker roles. Clearly, the stereotypes surrounding women’s roles in the United States at the time limited Trust Territory government efforts to cater to “women’s interests.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1017" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1017">[1,017]</a></sup> 'Another important women’s club, though one which includes men in some of its activities, is the Truk Red Cross. Koben Mori established the first Red Cross Chapter in Truk in the 1930s (Dolan 1974:59), but it was moribund during most of the American period. In 1984, the wife of one of Koben Mori’s descendants revived the Red Cross organization in Truk to aid local relief efforts after a cholera epidemic. She also hoped the Red Cross would show women they could take care of others in their own communities without outside help. In 1985, recruiting meetings were held in villages throughout Truk State to explain the organization’s goals to [Page 52] women in outlying areas. Essentially, the Truk Red Cross was organized as a private community charity because it was not chartered by either the American Red Cross or the International Red Cross. Truk Red Cross members often carried gifts of soap, towels, or clothing donated by businesses or wealthy Trukese to the elderly poor. In addition to caring for less fortunate people on Moen, Red Cross members have engaged in civic beautification projects—cleaning up rubbish around the airport and the boat pool and planting flowers in public places. The organization sponsored a nine-day-long health care training class in 1987, led by a Honolulu physician, which ended with official first-aid certification of 40 women (The Micronesia Institute 1987). A new building they erected in 1987 was destroyed by Typhoon Nina in November of that year and funds were being sought for its replacement (Ibid.).' <sup id="cite_ref-1018" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1018">[1,018]</a></sup> The following material is mostly concerned with the post-colonial period: 'Micronesian and American business and professional women established the first formal women’s club in Truk in 1960. The Trukese-American Women’s Association (or TAWA) included government employees and women engaged in commercial activities ( Truk Review, May-June 1960, p. 4; U.S. Department of State 1960:83). Among the 22 dues-paying members of this new club were women from all government departments and all major trading companies ( Truk Review, May-June 1960, p. 4). The publicized purpose of this organization was modest indeed: “To gain a better understanding of one another and to provide an opportunity for social gatherings...” that occurred approximately once a month (Ibid.).' <sup id="cite_ref-1019" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1019">[1,019]</a></sup> 'Beyond church women’s groups, a number of other women’s clubs existed in Truk in the mid-1980s. One—Club 20—was a latter-day version of the old TAWA organization. Club 20 was a multiethnic group of elite Trukese and foreign women who met in Moen restaurants on the 20th of each month and had a maximum membership of 20. According to their bylaws, the purpose of Club 20 was to further members’ social and intellectual interests, and to cooperate with other organizations in advancing community welfare in the areas of beautification, sharing, and scholarships. Money for the scholarship fund was raised from white elephant, bazaar, and bake sales. In 1985, Club 20 had Trukese, Filipino, and American members, including local elite women who held government jobs or whose husbands were important government officials. The most recent attempt at a general organization linking various women’s groups in Truk was the Truk Women’s Association and its Planning Commission. Fin Anisi and Mwichen Maria women central to the temperance movement in Truk (see Chapter Five) established this organization and were the prime movers behind efforts to heighten women’s involvement in the political arena.' <sup id="cite_ref-1020" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1020">[1,020]</a></sup> We have chosen the establishment of the Red Cross society as a provisional turning point and adopted 1930 as the date of transition.

It is said that many chiefs go to the fields in order to inspect their condition so that if the occasion arises they can check the deliveries. The Truk chiefs do not have any other legal claims. Nevertheless their subjects give them assistance in their own interests. The chief usually receives the best part from festive meals and fishing. If there is fishing with mention of the name of the chief, however, he receives everything, and nobody is allowed to withhold anything. Woe to the one who in former times did not pay his tribute properly. He had no prospect of a long life. It is said of the old chiefs that they always had the blow shell beside them. When the puk, puk of the shell resounded from the chief’s house, the people knew its meaning immediately. They quickly came running in order to /117/ learn the wishes of the tyrant. At one time he would desire kon (pounded breadfruit), at another time fish, then [Page 128] bananas, then coconuts to drink. The chiefs today no longer dare commit these outrages but they still have sufficient means to obtain some things on the side. They announce a dance, for example, or hold an efilul (celebration in connection with house-building, held when the frame is erected). They certainly do not come out short at the feast connected with this. As a matter of fact, most chiefs understand very well how to entice from their people whatever they might like to have.' <sup id="cite_ref-1021" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1021">[1,021]</a></sup> Junior lineages and provisional title holders were expected to deliver food prestations on the occasion of feasts: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1022" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1022">[1,022]</a></sup> In case of conquest, subordinate districts were required to deliver food prestations to the victors: 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' <sup id="cite_ref-1023" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1023">[1,023]</a></sup> We are unsure whether between-district food prestations were also paid in the colonial period.

Colonial administrators charged taxes in currency, which stimulated the uptake of cash cropping: 'Payment of taxes is considered a lineage (i.e., a corporation) matter. A native who earns money donates it to his corporation for the payment of its members’ head tax. The Trukese claim that during the Japanese administration it was necessary for every lineage to have someone working for wages with the Japanese or with the Okinawan fishermen or earning cash through copra production in order to pay taxes. Even how, when the annual $2.00 head tax on able-bodied men comes due, there is a stimulus to copra production in order to raise the necessary cash. For these reasons, while money is the private property of the person who earns it, he is not always free to spend it as he wishes. His corporation has too strong a stake in the cash and, as with other types of property, may call on him to donate money to its treasury.' <sup id="cite_ref-1024" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1024">[1,024]</a></sup> 'As a result of the German, Japanese, and American administrations, the natives have become thoroughly aware of the value of money in relation to specific situations. It is needed to pay taxes and is required for the purchase of goods from local retail outlets. Money is in fairly wide use in native transactions, though barter continues as the more practical form of exchange. Two informants, for example, had no trouble in estimating the cash price of a coconut tree (if not old) at $2.00 and that of a breadfruit tree at $5.00, a big one fetching perhaps as much as $10.00. Sales of trees are, however, fairly rare. If they should become more common, one might predict that the price would rise to accord with their economic importance. As the present prices suggest, money plays no part in the domestic food economy. It is needed to purchase food by only a handful of natives. Except for them, money is treated simply as an important sort of movable property ( pisek). One may make a niffag of money, trade it for goods or for labor, and have it appropriated by one’s wife’s brothers as a kiis.' <sup id="cite_ref-1025" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1025">[1,025]</a></sup> 'The impact of these economic changes upon the Trukese was great. Just as under the Germans law and order were made the province of the administration, a step which can be reversed (without chaos) only by a long and intelligently directed course of evolution, so under the Japanese the step to a money economy and dependence upon some categories of imported goods was carried far enough beyond the German beginnings so that it too has become irreversible. While the Trukese were not indoctrinated in the more skilled techniques, such as deep-sea fishing and boat-building, there were many jobs available at manual labor, an ever-increasing flow of trade goods upon which to spend the earnings thereof, and head taxes to assure that those who did not work cut copra. The Trukese began to travel more and more on Japanese boats (many of which they have now taken over and operate), to use a wider variety of Japanese tools, to eat (although not depend upon) rice and canned fish, and to wear clothese exclusively of foreign material.' <sup id="cite_ref-1026" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1026">[1,026]</a></sup> 'The same may be said of copra production. This, however, being the principal source of cash income is considered productive and as being essentially a lineage function, although one person or household will have charge of the drying racks and the attendant responsibility for getting the copra under cover in the event of rain. Revenue derived from the sale of copra is usually received by the lineage head [Page 139] who retains it for the benefit of the lineage members, although without any sort of strict accountability. Thus the head taxes levied on all adult men are often paid by the lineage head for all male members.' <sup id="cite_ref-1027" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1027">[1,027]</a></sup> Government chiefs received a share in the taxes they collected for the government: 'Upon the delivery of the head tax the chiefs were given a few marks back from the German government as gratification. All in all the chief’s office is not a position which can make the possessor rich. It is understandable if the chief further bleeds his people somewhat on the side, especially since often enough he must draw on his purse in their behalf. If two families quarrel on account of something and the one must pay compensation, it is advanced by the chief if the family cannot pay. If someone from a foreign tribe has a claim on a member of his tribe, the chief is responsible for it. All creditors depend on him. Afterwards he can see to getting it back from the debtors. It is strange that the chief is even obliged to distribute gifts here and there. If he sees that one of his people is stirred up about something and he fears disagreeable /118/ scenes, he calms him with little gifts. [Page 129] He knows from experience that the subjects are able to annoy the chief more than he them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1028" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1028">[1,028]</a></sup> Gladwin also mentions public labour services for the construction of sanitation infrastructure: 'The work activity probably second to food production and preparation, in point of time expended, consists in the maintenance of the island paths, seawalls, and other public works, together with the implementation of the administration’s sanitation directives. One day a week (on a few islands two) is set aside by agreement between the chief and the people for such labor in which all healthy adults from the ages of sixteen to sixty participate through most of the working hours of the day. A cash payment into the island treasury approximately equivalent to the current wage for manual labor may be substituted for this, but can be afforded in general only by those whose regular employment for pay elsewhere precludes their participation. This work is essentially non-productive from the standpoint of the lineages or individuals involved but is rather vaguely felt to be good for the island and in any event is acepted as inevitable. Practically all of the projects undertaken on these island work days can be traced to the orders or recommendations of the present and past foreign administrations; they thus represent a major source of work in excess of the requirements of earlier days.' <sup id="cite_ref-1029" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1029">[1,029]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Taxes are imposed on:</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Land ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Property ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ People ♣ present ♥</b> The sources describe a head tax (see above).

Later a small agricultural school was established on Dublon Island, Truk, and, after the Japanese started to alienate “undeveloped” native land for colonization, a surveyor’s school was established in Palau.' <sup id="cite_ref-1033" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1033">[1,033]</a></sup> Economic 'development' was interrupted during the World Wars: 'While the militarization of Truk, which was to prove a disatrously inadequate bastion for the Japanese in the second World War, changed the emphasis of Japanese [Page 45] development of the islands, it served merely to accelerate the processes of change in the Trukese society initiated earlier by the economic development program which of course continued but on a lesser scale. But with the beginning of the air strikes against Truk in 1944, and the blockade which followed, the fruits of the Japanese efforts at economic development were destroyed and the necessity of supporting some 35,000 foreigners in addition to the almost 10,000 Trukese off the land resulted in a serious depletion of their resources. Intensive cultivation of sweet potatoes made unfit for use many acres of good gardening land, and the extensive use of explosives in fishing, as well as the underwater explosion of many aerial bombs and mines, depleted the fish population to an extent which is felt to the present day. While there are still plenty of fish, they are not as numerous in any one place, and therefore harder to catch.' <sup id="cite_ref-1034" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1034">[1,034]</a></sup> Commercial fishing was introduced in the colonial period. Goodenough's comments seem to imply that further economic diversification only emerged under American administration: 'Okinawans developed commercial fishing during Japanese rule; and some commercial fishing on a small scale was continued by the Chuukese after World War II. Under American rule, the principle source of cash income was government employment as teachers and program administrators. Tourism was unimportant.' <sup id="cite_ref-1035" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1035">[1,035]</a></sup> 'Men and women have both entered into school teaching, clerical work, and administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-1036" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1036">[1,036]</a></sup> 'New arts include motor maintenance (of cars and outboards); boat building; bookkeeping; school teaching; government administration; and nursing and medical practice.' <sup id="cite_ref-1037" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1037">[1,037]</a></sup> We have assumed that in the colonial period, the number of native petty officials and craftsmen was very small, with most islanders remaining in subsistence horticulture.
