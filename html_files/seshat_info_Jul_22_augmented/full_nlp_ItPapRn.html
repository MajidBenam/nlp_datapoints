Julius' pontificate furthermore was a highpoint of the Roman Renaissance, as he sponsored artists such as Rafael and Michelangelo; in addition to this, Rome in the first quarter of the sixteenth century was a major diplomatic and political hub.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_ItPapRn] This peak date should be bracketed, however, given that Julius was widely reviled during his own time (Erasmus wrote a famous dialogue between him and St. Peter, castigating Julius' worldliness) and by posterity as an excessively worldly pope. In addition, the almost completely secular orientation of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth-century popes was directly responsible for the Protestant Reformation, which would mark one of the greatest challenges to papal power the Church had ever faced.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1378-1527 CE ♥</b>The polity period begins with the return of the papacy to Rome, and ends with the Sack of Rome. Pope Urban V (r. 1362-70) attempted to return to Rome, but was driven out by the Romans and returned to Avignon in 1370.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_ItPapRn] The efforts of the papacy to return to Rome and the Patrimony were frequently stymied, and Urban VI's eventual success (1377-78) in returning to Rome provoked the Great Schism.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Alternate start: 1417. "popes in the century between ca. 1430 and 1530 concentrated their efforts on protecting their Italian domain and in lavishly reconstructing the city of Rome.

In general, the various lords, cities, and feudatories of the papal states were ready and willing to rebel when possible (for example, in 1375.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_ItPapRn]) Furthermore, the lords of the Romagna were <i>de facto</i> independent for much of the late 14th and early 15th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_ItPapRn] During the mid-15th century, King Ferrante of Naples deliberately contracted with Roman barons for them to raise mercenary bands for his service, undercutting these barons' feudal ties to the papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ItPapRn]Brackets are required to reflect the consolidation of papal authority in the papal states during the fifteenth century, and the ambiguous relationship between papally-appointed, clerical officials and the local elites they were theoretically superior to.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItPapRn] Peterson has characterized the Church by this period as bureaucratic and legalistic, especially in the administration of the papal state.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥</b> The period up to 1494 was marked by a lack of foreign interference in Italian affairs.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItPapRn] As distinct from the 13th and most of the 14th centuries, the papacy was often free from domination by German emperors or Spanish kings, following the return to Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItPapRn] Brackets should be added to indicate the drastically changed situation between 1494-1527, following the French king Charles VIII's invasion of Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Rome - Republic Restoration Period ♥</b>  <i>Cola di Rienzo's Revolution in Rome. </i>Nicholaus, severus et clemens, libertatis, pacis justiciaeque tribunus, et sacra Romana Reipublica liberator.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Papal States - Medieval Period I ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Christendom ♥</b> However, during the period 1300-1450 CE "the idea of Christendom as a supranational entity toward which all Christians felt supreme loyalty and affection slowly collapsed. With the evolution of independent political and physical territories, soon to be called national monarchies or states, Christians began to choose between allegiance to state and devotion to church, and many chose the former. By the fifteenth century, the papacy ceased to function as a universal power and more and more like another regional Italian prince jealously guarding his fiefdom."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ Rome ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Latin ♥</b> Latin remained the language of administration, culture, and intellectual life during this period.

Goldthwaite has argued that the papacy's return to Rome in 1378 inaugurated a phase of economic growth for the Rome and its hinterland, reflecting Rome's dependence on the papacy, and not Lazio's productivity, to stimulate the economy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItPapRn] Before the sack of Rome in 1527 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItPapRn] the population had finally begun to grow again, from about 30,000 early in the 14th century to 55,000.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Renaissance Popes attempted to systematize and unify the financial administration of the Papal State. This meant ending financial and judicial immunities, and rolling back the power of locally powerful bishops and abbots.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItPapRn] However, the vast bureaucracy the Pope oversaw was a fundamentally corrupt one, by the late 14th century founded on bribery, the sale of offices, and patronage politics.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItPapRn] During the fifteenth century, the sale of offices within the <i>curia</i> became routinized; and Peterson has estimated that under Pope Leo X (1513-1521), two thousand offices were for sale in the city of Rome alone.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The papacy's ability to control the regions of the Papal States fluctuated dramatically during this period, especially during the Great Schism (1378-1417 CE). During the Schism, numerous ecclesiastical territories in the Papal State were seized by or alienated to secular lords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItPapRn] The 1380s and 1390s were characterized by a long and futile struggle between the Roman and Avignon popes for control of territory and finances in central and southern Italy, with the long-term result being the destabilization of central Italy and the intensified decentralization of power in the Papal State, especially in the Romagna and <i>le Marche</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In general, the various lords, cities, and feudatories of the papal states were ready and willing to rebel when possible, for example, in 1375 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItPapRn] Furthermore, the lords of the petty Lords known as the Romagna were <i>de facto</i> independent for much of the late 14th and early 15th centuries.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItPapRn] During the mid-15th century, King Ferrante of Naples deliberately contracted with Roman barons for them to raise mercenary bands for his service, undercutting these barons' feudal ties to the papacy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]As distinct from the previous centuries, up until 1494 CE the Papal States was usually free from influence of German emperors or Spanish kings,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItPapRn] but the drastically changed situation between 1494-1527 CE, following the French king Charles VIII's invasion of Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Joe Figliulo-Rosswurm ♥</b>This polity was coded early, was the target of dedicated workshops, and had many experts look over it.

A lower figure seems more suitable for this period, when papal control over the papal states was less secure and often virtually non-existent due to schisms or rebellions. It remains rough, though, and needs more research (see my August 2014 status report-JFR). -- <i>how do we code unsecurely held territory? to be consistent with coding of other polities we might code the full territory that was, that was claimed and for which effort was expended to be retained? - ET</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]c1200 CE 44,000 </div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ 600,000: 1400 CE; 1,600,000: 1500 CE ♥</b> 900,000: 1400 CE; 1,600,000: 1500 CE This figure is from Black.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_ItPapRn] The population of the papal states was severely affected by the Black Death (1347-49) and subsequent plague cycles (in particular, the plague of 1363 seems to have had a major impact). Black's estimate would make the Papal State roughly equal to that of the Veneto: in the sixteenth century Venice and its Terrafirma were estimated to contain around one and a half million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_ItPapRn] Whereas the Veneto was mostly arable flatland in the Po River Valley, much of the Papal States was mountainous and contained dispersed or scarce population, so the total population may have been lower, especially in the immediate aftermath of the plague cycles of 1347-1349 and 1363-1364. Black has estimated that Italy as a whole had around 11 million people in 1500.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>ET</i>: McEvedy and Jones estimated that Italy as a whole had around 10,000,000 people in 1500 CE and 7,000,000 in 1400 CE after the Black Death "cut the population back by about a third."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_ItPapRn] The estimate we have for the preceding century is 300,000-1,500,000. 900,000 (mid-point figure) minus a third gives an estimate of 600,000 for 1400 CE.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [25,000-33,000]: 1400 CE; 55,000: 1500 CE ♥</b> Rome remained the largest settlement in the Papal States during this period, although the population of the city plummeted drastically following the 1527 Sack of Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_ItPapRn] Partner[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_ItPapRn] has estimated a slightly lower population count for Rome around 1400, stating that its population was around 25,000 people.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ 430 ♥</b> The largest communication distance across the Papal States was from Gaeta to Modena, on either end of the polity, at 568 km.

Pope: The pope remained the head of a vast bureaucracy and leader of the papal state, despite ongoing weakness on the ground during the fifteenth century. Some popes, however, such as John XXIII and Julius II, were effective administrators and military leaders.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals and legates: The cardinalate had increased in number from 24 (the limit set by the Council of Constance, 1414-1418) to 35 by 1500 or so.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItPapRn] By this period, the cardinals were a fundamental part of papal elections and crucial to the politics of the papal states. Legates-often, themselves, cardinals-handled diplomatic business outside of the papal states. The cardinals' palaces in Rome were in effect sub-headquarters of the papal bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. The <i>curia</i>: By the late 14th century, the papal bureaucracy had become a massive, complex machine founded on bribery, the sale of offices, and patronage politics.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_ItPapRn] Papal officials operated in Avignon until 1378, returning with the papacy to Rome. During the fifteenth century, the sale of offices within the <i>curia</i> became routinized; Peterson has estimated that under Pope Leo X (1513-1521), two thousand offices were for sale in the city of Rome alone.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_ItPapRn]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3.

The popes could occasionally intervene against these petty lords, but the Papal State would not attain internal cohesion and administration (to a limited extent) until the sixteenth century. Despite this internal weakness, the papacy was strong enough that the Papal State was one of the five guarantor powers of the Peace of Lodi (1454), which established an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between the Italian powers (the papacy, Florence, Milan, Venice, and the Kingdom of Naples).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_ItPapRn]</div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religious levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> Pope; Cardinals and legates; archbishops; bishops and abbots; parish priests and members of the religious orders; deacons.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Pope: The pope was, of course, the universally-acknowledged leader of Latin Christendom. This does not contradict the fact that who exactly was the legitimate pope was often contested during the period 1378-1418, during the Great Schism. During this period the papacy arrogated to itself the right to appoint bishops, negating the tradition of bishops being elected by their flock in conjunction with the priesthood.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]2. Cardinals and legates: The cardinalate was crucial in theological decision-making and the religious aspects of papal government; legates, similarly, handled religious matters abroad on occasion.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>3. Archbishops: To a certain extent, archbishops were equivalent to cardinals, but there were more of them, distributed throughout Christendom. They supervised their suffragan bishops and bishoprics, while also overseeing their own (a good example is the Archbishop of Milan).</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>4. Bishops and abbots: Bishops were the crucial link between local religion and the papacy. There were 263 bishoprics in  14th century Italy.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_ItPapRn] Abbots sometimes played a role beyond the walls of their monasteries, although by this point once-powerful regional centers such as Farfa were in decline in Lazio.</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div><div>5. Parish priests and members of the religious orders: These constituted the mundane religious level. Parish priests embodied Christianity for their flock, for the most part, since they said Mass, heard confession and, in general, were (supposed to) serve as the quotidian face of the organized Church. Members of the religious orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, and so forth) also were a common part of the Church's presence, especially in the towns.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_ItPapRn]</div></div></div></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> Pope; legates and rectors; counts and <i>signori</i>; mercenary leaders; rank and file.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Yet these troops were usually recruited into mercenary bands that either operated alone (the <i>condottieri</i>) or were incorporated into semi-professional armies (as was the case later in the period, with the Spanish <i>tercios</i>).

Visconti of Milan. Neapolitans.  Milanese condottieri. Alfonso of Aragon. Ottomans (Turkish raids). France. Spain. Venice. Holy Roman Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the later 14th century, the Visconti of Milan had succeeded in conquering much of northern and central Italy, and the struggle between the Visconti and Florence was a main feature of the period ca. 1390-1402, with the papacy involved as an intermediary and the feudatories of the Papal State taking sides as the fortunes of war dictated. Perugia submitted to Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1400, and the lords of the Romagna were under Visconti suzerainty until the death of Gian Galeazzo in September 1402.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Italian situation changed forever with the French King Charles VIII's descent into Italy in 1494. This invasion and the war it began were the opening of decades of foreign intervention and chaotic warfare between the French, Spanish, and all the principalities of the peninsula. The papacy was involved in most of these wars, and under Pope Julius II (r. 1503-1513) was a primary force in organizing a coalition against the Venetians before switching sides. In the 1499-1504 war, the Spanish decisively defeated the French and established control over the kingdom of Naples, creating a powerful Spanish presence on the peninsula that would last into the 18th century. Julius II, who became pope in 1503, organized the League of Cambrai against Venice, beginning the War of the League of Cambrai (1508-1516). The Venetians were crushed at Agnadello (1509) but managed to hold out against the League. The French switched sides and began fighting the papacy in 1510. Much of the fighting now moved to the Romagna, in papal territory. The French scored a crushing victory over the papally-led League at Ravenna in April 1512, but within a few months massive rebellions across northern Italy had forced the French out of Italy again.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_129_ItPapRn] Following Julius' death in 1513, the war ended in an agreement between France and Venice to partition Italy north of the Po River Valley. In 1512-1513, Florence and with it Tuscany passed under <i>de facto</i> papal overlordship, especially under the two Medici popes, Leo X and Clement VII.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_130_ItPapRn] Pope Clement VII's indecisive refusal to commit to either the French or the Empire, combined with the bad discipline and lack of pay of the imperial army, led to the sack of Rome in 1527.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_131_ItPapRn] This was an unmitigated disaster for the city; when Clement refused to quarter the imperial mercenaries in the city and pay their arrears, they viciously sacked the city, murdering thousands.

It was a smashing success: the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani estimated that 200,000 pilgrims in Rome for the Jubilee.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_160_ItPapRn][MAJIDBENAM_REF_161_ItPapRn] While Villani's number, like those of all medieval chroniclers, is a estimate, it indicates the widespread popularity of the ritual. There were enough pilgrims in the city that we have several accounts of people being crushed and trampled to death at particularly popular sites.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_162_ItPapRn] Pilgrims visited the major cult centers around the city, offering gifts; there is a notorious scene in an anonymous chronicler's account in which two clerks stood outside St. Peter's Beyond the Walls with large rakes, gathering up the coins offered by pilgrims.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_163_ItPapRn]"The medieval Roman Jubilee was a year-long celebration of penitence during which pilgrims visited Rome's most important churches and gained plenary indulgences. From its inauguration in 1300, the Holy Year developed through the combined interests of late medieval popes, Roman citizens, and pilgrims. Popes sought to amplify Rome's importance in an era of over-confident kings and emperors; Romans battled for their economic welfare and for ownership of the papacy itself; and pilgrims beset by war and pestilence searched for the complete spiritual cleansing that the Jubilee's plenary indulgence offered. "According to the legend recorded by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi, the Holy Year initially drew its inspiration from a Hebrew tradition recorded in Leviticus in which every fifty years the Jews remitted each others' debts. Stefaneschi wrote of how in 1300 a multitude of millenarian-inspired pilgrims thronged to Rome. In response, Boniface VIII's advisors devised a Christian version of the biblical jubilee. On February 22, the pope declared that each one-hundredth year (centesimo) Rome would host a year of penitential pilgrimage. During this solemn celebration, Christians who visited the Roman shrines dedicated to the church's foremost Apostles, Saints Peter and Paul, would be awarded a plenary indulgence. This 'grand pardon' was a thorough remission of the temporal debt a Christian acquired through sinning. The general understanding was that it promised immediate admission into heaven upon death provided that the pilgrim sinned no further. As with all indulgences, the plenary depended upon the Treasury of Merits earned by Christ and the saints, made visible in Rome's multiple relics. Previously, the plenary had been available only to crusaders. At the time, Boniface was embroiled in conflict with the aggressive King Philip IV of France. Offering Jubilee pilgrims the plenary indulgence highlighted the penitential significance of Rome's relics of Peter and Paul, as well as the pope's central authority in spiritual matters. "To gain the Jubilee plenary, a pilgrim was required to have sincere contrition, perform the sacrament of confession, and visit St Peter's basilica and the basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls for a specified term of days -- fifteen for foreigners, thirty for Romans. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani attested to seeing the peaceful throngs of pilgrims from all over Christendom, 'with much patience, and without noises or quarrels,' crowding Rome's streets, all intent on penitential devotion. The biggest attraction was the Veronica Veil, or Sudarium, an ancient cloth imprinted with the 'true likeness' (vera icona) of Christ and housed at St Peter's."

Baptism was carried out in the cities in the mother-church, the Duomo; in the countryside, parish churches (<i>pievi</i>), staffed by a college of priests, performed the ceremony.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_210_ItPapRn] The ritual made natural-born children into Christians, and thus members of the official cult. So central to the cult was baptism that, in extreme situations, lay people could baptize children, especially if the child was in immediate danger of death. Baptism forgave sin, original or that done by the person in question.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_211_ItPapRn] Baptism was irrevocable, and those who renounced it were ipso facto apostates from Christianity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_212_ItPapRn] Infants dying unbaptized were, according to orthodox Catholicism, doomed to go to Limbo, somewhere between Purgatory and Heaven.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_213_ItPapRn] Because of this, denial of the necessity of efficacy of baptism became an increasingly frequent element in heretical beliefs from the twelfth century onwards.

The central ritual within the broader ritual of the Mass was the sacrament of the Eucharist. By the canons of Lateran IV, all the laity were required to receive the Eucharist, and thus attend Mass, at least once a year, on Easter.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_263_ItPapRn] Parish priests were supposed to say Mass daily, but the attendance of the laity, as the canon just discussed would indicate, was not required.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_264_ItPapRn] Because of the increasing importance attached to it on the part of the central ecclesiastical authorities during this period, we have more information on it than for the previous polity period.

Thompson cites numerous statutory evidence showing that in central Italy, city-states closed courts and farmers took days off for saints' days.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_324_ItPapRn] Some city-states, such as Florence, gave amnesties to debtors on the city's patron saint day, and other acts of charity were practiced.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_325_ItPapRn] Feast days typically included a ritual procession, mass for the entire community, and feasting, singing and dancing.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_326_ItPapRn] Thompson has noted, writing of the central Italian cities, that patron saints' days usually fell in the summer to provide good weather for outdoor parties. Other activities might include pageant plays, parades, and singing, with some of these organized by religious confraternities, (Thompson 2010) citing evidence from 1208 Piacenza, just to the north-west of the Papal State.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_327_ItPapRn] Generally speaking, these festivals were the occasion for a temporary relaxation of the social order, and marked both religious festivals and changes in the agricultural year, such as Midsummer and Rogationtide.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_328_ItPapRn] Wickham (2015) notes, however, that at least a few of the rituals described in Benedetto's 12th-c. guide to the Roman liturgy had their roots in fourth-century Christian celebrations, or even pre-Christian, pagan roots.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_329_ItPapRn] Suffice to say, the city of Rome was saturated in liturgical events and places.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ monthly ♥</b> Each feast day was celebrated at Rome with a full liturgy, in a given church or papal basilica.

Each constituted an authoritative literate discourse, and together they spoke about women and gender in a remarkably coherent chorus. Women were understood as less than men, female attributes as less good than male ones, and gender relations as properly characterized by womanly submission and manly governance.

For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the rst was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage.

It was not only a “legal impossibility,” as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too.

Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms. It was taken for granted that the universe was designed in such a way that some of God’s creatures were intended to be at the topand some below them. Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality. Until late in the Middle Ages, few appear to have seen anything wrong with the idea that there should be rulers and ruled, for hierarchical arrangements of parts within wholes were a normal way of making an organism ‘work’. A body needs a head but it also needs feet (I Corinthians 12.20). In fragmentary survivals of the teaching which was given in the cathedral school at Laon at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries, there is a discussion of the passage in Ephesians 6.5 where servants are told to obey their masters. ‘It is no sin to have a servant or to be a servant.’ It was argued at Laon that there are two reasons why ‘servitude is given by God.’ It may be a punishment for the sins of those who are slaves or servants. Or it may have a purpose of proving or testing them, so that, humbled, they may be better people.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_492_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> From the eighth century to the Counter-reformation era, from Scandinavia to France to Italy, Christian penitentials regularly included instructions regarding the kinds of penance clergy should assign to those guilty of the following acts: homicide, perjury, sacrilege, drunkenness, various types of sexual transgressions (including adultery, incest, sodomy and bestiality), sorcery, respect for one's parents, and theft[MAJIDBENAM_REF_493_ItPapRn].

Since marriage was a sacrament, the church claimed exclusive jurisdiction over it, appropriating and expanding the laws of nature (Natural Law) and Scripture as well as some of the rules in the early church constitutions and Christianized Roman law. Comprehensive new laws, called canon laws, were promulgated by the papacy and the church councils and enforced by church courts throughout Western Christendom.//”Consistent with the naturalist perspective on marriage, the church’s canon law punished contraception, abortion, and child abuse as violations of the created functions of propagation and child rearing. It also proscribed unnatural sexual acts, such as sodomy and bestiality. Consistent with the contractual perspective, canon law ensured free consnsual unions by dissolving marriages contracted by mistake or under duress, fraud, or coercion. It also granted husband and wife equal rights to enforce conjugal debts that had been voluntarily assumed and emphasized the importance of mutual love among the couple, their children, and their parents.//”Consistent with the sacramental perspective canon law protcted the sanctity and sanctifying purpose of marriage by declaring valid marital bonds to be indissoluble and by annulling invalid unions between Christians and non-Christians or between parties related by various legal, spiritual, blood, or family ties. It supported celibacy by annulling unconsummated vows of marriage if one party made a vow of chastity and by prohibiting clerics on monastics from marriage and concubinage.//”Earlier Christianized Roman and Germanic laws governing the relationships between husband and wife, and parent and child, were liberally appropriated by the canonists and now enforced in the church courts as well as in the confessional (Confession of Sins). Traditional rules and customs of arranged marriages, patriarchal restrictions on the marital estate, male-dominated inheritance laws and primogeniture, protection of the status of the paterfamilias, and restrictions on the wife’s capacity to sue or be sued, to enter into contracts, to give or receive property of her own—all remained firmly in place in canon law.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_495_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> “On the individual level, Augustine counseled nonresistance, hence, nonviolence; he worried that inordinate desires even to preserve one’s own life could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could lead further to evil deeds. augustine knew well the horrors of war and the lusts that war itself incites. Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_496_ItPapRn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> From the eighth century to the Counter-reformation era, from Scandinavia to France to Italy, Christian penitentials regularly included instructions regarding the kinds of penance clergy should assign to those guilty of the following acts: homicide, perjury, sacrilege, drunkenness, various types of sexual transgressions (including adultery, incest, sodomy and bestiality), sorcery, respect for one's parents, and theft[MAJIDBENAM_REF_497_ItPapRn].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ present ♥</b> E.g. excommunication, inquisition. “In the West excommunication was at the discretion of bishops and the pope until late antiquity.
