The period has therefore been characterized as one of egalitarian social organization, in which status could perhaps be achieved but not inherited.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_MxTieLa] The population, estimated at 500-1000, was dispersed throughout the valley with settlements clustered on the most fertile land in the Etla arm.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_MxTieLa][MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_MxTieLa] Most of these settlements were small (between one and three hectares), except for San José Mogote, which was larger (seven hectares), had a defensive palisade and featured larger buildings that could have been used as public spaces.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_MxTieLa] However, there is no evidence that the influence of San José Mogote extended beyond the village to other settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_MxTieLa] The 'type site', Tierras Largas, covered around 1.6-2.2 ha and consisted of 5-10 households with nearby storage pits.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_MxTieLa] The inhabitants of the valley cultivated domestic crops and supplemented their diet by gathering wild fruits and hunting animals.

"Both men’s and women’s ritual involved ancestors, but there were differences.Women seem to have been more concerned with recent ancestors,especially female ancestors. Men were more concerned with the spirits of remote ancestors, including those of supernatural apical ancestors. Women’s ritual involved divining and the manipulation of figurines. Men’s ritual involved blood-letting, dancing in costumes, and the use of ritual plants such as tobacco and jimson weed (Datura spp.). "[...] "One of the loci for ritual during theTierras Largas and early San José phases was a one-room public building, too small to hold all the members of the community (Fig. 2). These structures were probably used by a subset of the villagers—fully initiated males—who met periodically to petition their ancestors for aid in agricultural production, community events, and perhaps even intervillage raiding. "These early structures, of which we have found about ten, never contain domestic artifacts, figurines, or any tools one might associate with women. They do contain sharp obsidian flakes that could have been used for autosacrifice, and they have lime-filled pits that may be associated with the use of narcotic plants. "[...]. "The Tierras Largas phase Men’s Houses contained two to three times as many posts as ordinary houses and were given a coat of lime plaster inside and out. The floor was also surfaced with lime plaster, in contrast to the floors of ordinary houses which were of stamped clay covered with a layer of sand. Several of the Men’s Houses had a centrally placed, lime-plastered storage pit built into the floor, a feature not encountered in ordinary residences.These pits were filled with powdered lime, possibly stored for later use with ritual plants such as quèeza (tobacco) or nocuanacohui (Datura) or perhaps even for rituals of purification—the Zapotec employ the same word (teáaya) for 'to purify' and 'to whiten with lime' (Marcus and Flannery 1978; Marcus 1989: figs. 8.5 and 8.6 top)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_MxTieLa] "Near some of these Men’s Houses or “lineage houses” we found seated burials of tightly bundled middle-aged men. Perhaps, therefore, after a period of ritual veneration in the household, certain important men were moved to a position near the Men’s House in which they had once practiced rituals.This practice would be analogous to the Chinese tradition (presented earlier by way of comparison) in which some ancestors are honored in the household by women for a few generations, then transferred to the Ancestral Hall. If the Chinese example is relevant, we should look for clues that Formative Mesoamerican ancestors were treated (1) as personalized individuals while honored in the home, but (2) as impersonal and less individualized ancestors when buried near the 'lineage house.'"

Moreover, though Marcus reconstructs two possible women's rituals, only one can be coded. The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived.

The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived. We suspect, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, that small solid figurines— of which we have found hundreds in household context—provided the medium to which the spirits of specific ancestors could return during this petitioning. Women preferred to petition their female ancestors, which may account for the fact that the majority of these figurines are women." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_255_MxTieLa] "Women’s ritual seems to have been conducted in the house, the adjacent lean-to, and the surrounding dooryard.

Men’s ritual involved blood-letting, dancing in costumes, and the use of ritual plants such as tobacco and jimson weed (Datura spp.)."[...] "One of the loci for ritual during theTierras Largas and early San José phases was a one-room public building, too small to hold all the members of the community (Fig. 2). These structures were probably used by a subset of the villagers—fully initiated males—who met periodically to petition their ancestors for aid in agricultural production, community events, and perhaps even intervillage raiding. "These early structures, of which we have found about ten, never contain domestic artifacts, figurines, or any tools one might associate with women. They do contain sharp obsidian flakes that could have been used for autosacrifice, and they have lime-filled pits that may be associated with the use of narcotic plants."[...]. "The Tierras Largas phase Men’s Houses contained two to three times as many posts as ordinary houses and were given a coat of lime plaster inside and out. The floor was also surfaced with lime plaster, in contrast to the floors of ordinary houses which were of stamped clay covered with a layer of sand. Several of the Men’s Houses had a centrally placed, lime-plastered storage pit built into the floor, a feature not encountered in ordinary residences.These pits were filled with powdered lime, possibly stored for later use with ritual plants such as quèeza (tobacco) or nocuanacohui (Datura) or perhaps even for rituals of purification—the Zapotec employ the same word (teáaya) for 'to purify' and 'to whiten with lime' (Marcus and Flannery 1978; Marcus 1989: figs. 8.5 and 8.6 top)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_283_MxTieLa] "Near some of these Men’s Houses or “lineage houses” we found seated burials of tightly bundled middle-aged men. Perhaps, therefore, after a period of ritual veneration in the household, certain important men were moved to a position near the Men’s House in which they had once practiced rituals.This practice would be analogous to the Chinese tradition (presented earlier by way of comparison) in which some ancestors are honored in the household by women for a few generations, then transferred to the Ancestral Hall. If the Chinese example is relevant, we should look for clues that Formative Mesoamerican ancestors were treated (1) as personalized individuals while honored in the home, but (2) as impersonal and less individualized ancestors when buried near the 'lineage house.'"

Men were more concerned with the spirits of remote ancestors, including those of supernatural apical ancestors. Women’s ritual involved divining and the manipulation of figurines. Men’s ritual involved blood-letting, dancing in costumes, and the use of ritual plants such as tobacco and jimson weed (Datura spp.). "[...] "One of the loci for ritual during theTierras Largas and early San José phases was a one-room public building, too small to hold all the members of the community (Fig. 2). These structures were probably used by a subset of the villagers—fully initiated males—who met periodically to petition their ancestors for aid in agricultural production, community events, and perhaps even intervillage raiding. "These early structures, of which we have found about ten, never contain domestic artifacts, figurines, or any tools one might associate with women. They do contain sharp obsidian flakes that could have been used for autosacrifice, and they have lime-filled pits that may be associated with the use of narcotic plants. "[...]. "The Tierras Largas phase Men’s Houses contained two to three times as many posts as ordinary houses and were given a coat of lime plaster inside and out. The floor was also surfaced with lime plaster, in contrast to the floors of ordinary houses which were of stamped clay covered with a layer of sand. Several of the Men’s Houses had a centrally placed, lime-plastered storage pit built into the floor, a feature not encountered in ordinary residences.These pits were filled with powdered lime, possibly stored for later use with ritual plants such as quèeza (tobacco) or nocuanacohui (Datura) or perhaps even for rituals of purification—the Zapotec employ the same word (teáaya) for 'to purify' and 'to whiten with lime' (Marcus and Flannery 1978; Marcus 1989: figs. 8.5 and 8.6 top)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_301_MxTieLa] "Near some of these Men’s Houses or “lineage houses” we found seated burials of tightly bundled middle-aged men. Perhaps, therefore, after a period of ritual veneration in the household, certain important men were moved to a position near the Men’s House in which they had once practiced rituals.This practice would be analogous to the Chinese tradition (presented earlier by way of comparison) in which some ancestors are honored in the household by women for a few generations, then transferred to the Ancestral Hall. If the Chinese example is relevant, we should look for clues that Formative Mesoamerican ancestors were treated (1) as personalized individuals while honored in the home, but (2) as impersonal and less individualized ancestors when buried near the 'lineage house.'"

There are few indications of social practices or concepts that brought people together as members of a community or barrio. The ritual buildings at San José Mogote are the strongest indicator of practices that engaged multiple households, although it is not clear whether they served only the Area C barrio or the entire community. As argued by J. E. Clark (2004), the evidence does not yet indicate the kinds of inscriptive practices, especially the creation of ceremonial centers, that anchored social memory and embodied notions of community identity in later Mesoamerican societies. If correct, communities at this time may be better viewed as co-resident groups rather than communities united by a sense of belonging characterized by perceptions of shared interests, history, and identity."
