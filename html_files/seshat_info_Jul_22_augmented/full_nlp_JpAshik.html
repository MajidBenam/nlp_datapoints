'At the end of the Kamakura period, Kyoto once again became the political center of Japan when the Ashikaga shoguns took up residence in the Muromachi section of the city and established the military government that is commonly referred to as the Muromachi period.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_JpAshik] During the Northern and Southern Courts (1336-92[CE]) The Northern Court situated at Kyoto.

Muromachi, a district of Kyoto, was the base of the shogunate's power, while Ashikaga is the name of the family who served as shoguns throughout the period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_JpAshik] The Muromachi Ashikaga period sometimes includes the sub-periods known as 'the Northern and Southern Courts' and the 'Warring States', although we have decided to separate the Warring States period into its own polity.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The period begins with the disintegration of Emperor Go-Daigo's brief 'Kenmu Restoration', an unsuccessful attempt to restore direct imperial control in Japan, and the appointment of Ashikaga Takauji as shogun by another branch of the imperial line with the support of other disillusioned lords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_JpAshik] This initiated the divide between the Northern and Southern Courts (1336-1392 CE), both of which claimed to be the legitimate ruling authority. The Northern Court was located in Kyoto and headed by Emperor Komyo (from the senior imperial line) and the Ashikaga shoguns. The Southern Court was located at Yoshino and was the seat of the Emperor Go-Daigo (from the junior imperial line) and his supporters.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The peak of the Ashikaga period corresponds to the reign of Shogun Yoshimitsu (r. 1368-1394 CE), who helped to broker the unification of the Northern and Southern Courts (1392 CE), with imperial succession reinstated through the Northern line. An able statesman, he helped advance many aspects of government and policy and was an active patron of the arts.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_JpAshik] His death in 1408 left a power vacuum that enabled provincial lords to gain greater independence from the court and shogunate.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Onin War (1467-1477 CE) effectively brought an end to this period, although the Ashikaga shogunate remained in power nominally until the overthrow of their last shogun by Oda Nobunaga in 1573.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_JpAshik] This civil war, precipitated by economic problems, famine and conflicts over succession (both to the shogunate and to provincial military offices) initiated the period of instability known as the Warring States period. The conflict destroyed much of Kyoto, and spilled out into the provinces.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Initially, the power of the Ashikaga Shogunate had theoretically extended throughout the main islands of Japan; however, by the time of the Onin War, the area under its direct control had shrunk to Kyoto and its hinterland.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_JpAshik] Despite this territorial disintegration, the 'idea' of a larger unified culture did not disappear.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, the respective imperial heads were nominally in power, while the Ashikaga shogunate controlled the government. In contrast to the preceding Kamakura military regime, the Ashikaga shoguns did not have absolute control: their power was in tension with 'other court families, other members of the military aristocracy, and the religious orders'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_JpAshik] Initially the Ashikaga shogunate retained much of the Kamakura administrative structure, even continuing to occupy the government buildings in Kamakura before moving their administration to the Muromachi district in 1378 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_JpAshik] Because the Ashikaga clan 'lacked significant landholdings and military might', these shoguns relied on their relationships with powerful vassals and provincial military governors to enforce their policies and keep other lords in line. However, as personal ties of loyalty deteriorated over time, the control of the shogunate over powerful provincial lords loosened and the latter were able to increase their independence from the central government.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population estimates for this period range from roughly 10 million around 1300 CE to approximately 17 million in 1500 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_JpAshik]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Ashikaga Shogunate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Ashikaga_1400CE: 1336CE-1467CE ♥</b>  Ashikaga_1400CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_JpAshik]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  287470: 1336CE-1467CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Japonic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Japanesic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Japanese ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Japanese State Shinto ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Japanese Mayahana ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Gréine Jordan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpAshik&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 295,000 ♥</b> KM2.  295,000: 1336 CE.

Control of Kyoto, in and of itself, was an important achievement, and the fact that Kyoto became subject to bakufu administration was of major significance for the Ashikaga house's staying ability.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_JpAshik] These trends reached a peak during the so-called sengoku or ‘warring states’ period (1467-1568) when the Japanese state itself began to fragment, causing the old borders to lose their original meaning as they were supplemented and replaced by a new system of ‘internal’ borders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_JpAshik] 'regional powers became more and more independent after the Onin War of the mid fifteenth century. During the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries these warlords, known as sengoku daimyo¯, consolidated their rule over domains that were essentially sovereign ‘mini-states’.

Although the fortunes of particular extended warrior families waxed and waned, only members of the warrior class could serve as shoguns, the military rulers. Their governments, known commonly as shogunates, were often challenged by the interests of other powerful warrior families in various parts of Japan and by the imperial family in Kyoto. Although the warrior bureaucracy largely controlled the affairs of the state, the emperor and the imperial court were still the formal head of government. Warrior governments typically sought out- or forced-the formal imperial decrees that gave legitimacy to the shoguns. Occasionally emperors would attempt to reassert direct imperial rule. They were, however, always suppressed in favor of warrior rule... Warrior governments functioned as a lord-vassal system of loyalty. This is reflected in the political structures of the different shogunates. Although they varied greatly in their organization, the notion of loyalty, whether earned or forced, always laid the foundation on which the warrior government was built.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_JpAshik] 'The Ashikaga shoguns of the medieval period, for all the noble status they had acquired, were obliged to share political power with other court families, other members of the military aristocracy, and the religious orders.

Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the sixth century from the Asian mainland and quickly became the religion of the aristocrats and the imperial family, thus assuming political significance. It was not until Japan’s medieval period that Buddhism became broadly diffused throughout Japanese society.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_207_JpAshik] ‘Although individual Japanese religions can be discussed, it is important to bear in mind that in many periods of Japanese history—including the medieval and early modern—distinctions between traditions were not very sharply drawn. This was true both in terms of a person’s worship and in terms of Japanese culture more generally.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_208_JpAshik] ‘in medieval and early modern Japan, practice was far more central to religious identity than was any profession of faith.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Religious rituals, though directed to numerous different ends, were often intended for life cycle events such as birth, marriage, and death. Religion was often intimately connected to the everyday, rather than directed beyond daily life. Festivals, too, celebrated various key events in the life of a community. Festivals were held in celebration of the harvest, the New Year, and to honor the spirits of the dead. Both rituals and festivals were methods of personal purification, showing appreciation for the fertility of the land, making offerings to honor the gods, Buddhas, and ancestors, requesting help in troubled times, and seeking the welfare of the community.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_210_JpAshik] ‘in medieval and early modern Japan, a very close connection between religion and the state was deemed both proper and necessary. Though there are exceptions, religion was often treated as ancillary to politics. Used to create national identity, religion served the nation as a means of providing legitimacy for political arrangements current at any given time. Japan’s national myth, that Japan was created from the sacred acts of the kami whose descendants form the imperial line, is one such use of religion to justify political power.

Whereas court ceremonies derived in large part from Chinese customs, village rituals tended to be indigenous and related to rice agriculture.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_212_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Shinto</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]‘Unlike many religions, Shinto has no founder and does not view any single text as its sole scripture. Shinto is closely associated with the Japanese sense of cultural identity. Shinto emphasizes practice over thought or formal doctrine. There is not a formal Shinto theology or rigidly codified set of moral rules. Shinto is intimately connected with the agricultural cycle and a sense of the sacredness of the natural world. The worship of kami and other ritual practices express these concerns... Ritual practice is central to Shinto traditions and includes such activities as purification, food offerings, dance, and festivals honoring the gods. While kami may be worshipped at shrines under the supervision of Shinto priests (kannushi), they can also be worshipped individually at a shrine or in the home. Further, Shinto associations (ko) provide yet another avenue for interaction with the kami.’ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_213_JpAshik] ‘On the one hand, Shinto describes an organized set of doctrines and practices related to the state. This perspective on Shinto is strongly tied to the mythology and founding stories of the imperial family, especially as expressed in the Kojiki (Record of ancient matters, compiled in 712). Shinto was important to the legitimating narratives by which the imperial family justified its right to rule. This aspect of Shinto was conspicuous for the rituals performed expressing the intimate connection between emperor and kami.’[MAJIDBENAM_REF_214_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b> Buddhism</b>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]'Buddhism originated in India and spread to China about four centuries after the time of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni (ca. fifth to fourth century, B.C.). It was transmitted to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula around the middle of the sixth century.1 The cultural gulf that existed at that time between Japan on the one hand and China and Korea on the other was considerable. Japan's ruling class accepted Buddhism as the embodiment of an advanced and superior civilization, and in order to gain control over the concepts and technology that Buddhism brought to Japan, the elite provided a succession of large temples where Buddhism could put down roots.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_215_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'it was in the Kamakura period that Buddhism in Japan came into full flower. The forms of Buddhism that emerged at that time - Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren - were largely responsible for the dissemination of Buddhist beliefs and practices throughout Japanese society. The success of this movement lay in tailoring the ideas and goals of Buddhism to the concerns of the populace at large. Hence, Kamakura Buddhism, as the entire religious movement is called, has left an indelible mark on Japanese history and has made Buddhism a lasting and pervasive component of Japanese culture.' [MAJIDBENAM_REF_216_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR]'From the end of the twelfth century through the middle of the thirteenth - that is, in the first half of the Kamakura period - some of Japan's foremost religious figures appeared, in quick succession. The schools of Buddhism that today claim them as their founders have long had considerable influence in Japan. From their inception in the Kamakura period, these schools stood as a separate religious movement from the eight schools that existed before them. These new schools came to be known collectively as Kamakura Buddhism. The establishment of Kamakura Buddhism was a pivotal event in Japanese history, because through it Buddhism was adapted to Japanese ways and thus made accessible to the common people.'[MAJIDBENAM_BR][MAJIDBENAM_REF_217_JpAshik]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=JpAshik&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ matsuri ♥</b> NOTE: Though normally Seshat policy is to code a specific ritual rather than a "type" of ritual, it does not seem that a particular one of the traditional Japanese festivals attracted more people than the others, and it might be a good idea to capture the apparent fact that the Japanese used to celebrate similarly large-scale rituals several times every year. Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more popular than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves.

"Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion.

The <i>norito</i> is recited, the staff purified for the day, and announcements made about the day's events and duties." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_307_JpAshik] "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami."

Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_343_JpAshik] For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson [MAJIDBENAM_REF_344_JpAshik], that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...]"Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai.

[...] According to custom, the heads of respectable samurai were cleaned and the hair combed before being examined. The cleaning of the decapitated heads sometimes fell to samurai women. A rare eyewitness account, recorded by the daughter of a samurai living in the castle during a battle, yields a description of this repugnant operation. The young girl, later known as Oan, the daughter of the respectable samurai Yamada Kyoreki, experienced the horror of sleeping beside a collection of severed heads in the Ogaki Castle of Mino during the great Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Although Oan’s experience was written down in a much later period, I cite from it because samurai women’s memoirs detailing the practice of wars are so uncommon: ‘My mother and I, as well as the wives and daughters of the other retainers, were in the tenshu [the highest building in the castle] casting bullets. Severed heads taken by our allies were also gathered up in this area of the castle. We attached a tag to each head in order to identify them properly. Then we repeatedly blackened their teeth. Why did we do that? A long time ago, blackened teeth were admired as the sign of a distinguished man. So, we were asked to apply a generous coat of ohaguro [a black dental dye] to any heads with white teeth. [Tooth-dyeing, a popular practice among the ladies of the court in the Heian period, was also affected by male aristocrats and warriors from the late Heian through the Muromachi periods.] Even these severed heads no longer held any terror for me. I used to sleep enveloped by the bloody odor of those old heads.’ [...] Here it is important to note that, even in the face of imminent defeat, the cosmetic beautifictation of the heads was regularly carried out. This act of cleaning the heads was in part a sign of respect for fallen warriors. More to the point, it represented a tribute to the victors’ honorific pride as men who could defeat heroic enemies. And the tangible proof of one’s prowess, in the form of a pile of severed heads, would certainly result in better rewards from one’s lord.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_388_JpAshik] Turnbull [MAJIDBENAM_REF_389_JpAshik] adds that “Head collecting is a tradition found throughout samurai history” and that “It was a practice that probably has roots in folk tradition because the handling of a corpse went wholly against the purity dictated by Shinto.”</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per

"The Ashikaga shoguns, however, had less support from this inheritance and were required to depend more upon institutions of their own making; hence their reliance on the provincial constables to whom they delegated much local authority. Under the Muromachi bakufu, the shugo acquired political influence by combining the authority the post had commanded under the Kamakura bakufu with that customarily available to the civil provincial governors under the imperial system. The chain of command among shogun, shugo, and provincial retainers now carried almost the entire burden of government, both nationally and locally." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_465_JpAshik] "As chiefs of the military estate, the Ashikaga shoguns did maintain a private bureaucracy and a guard force drawn from their extensive but individually weak jitō-grade vassals. But these direct retainers were limited in number, and in regard to serious military action, or to the staffing of important bakufu offices, the Ashikaga were heavily dependent on the shugo support." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_466_JpAshik] "Under the Kamakura bakufu, shugo had been given three specific functions: (1) enrolling bakufu retainers for guard duty at Kyoto and Kamakura, (2) suppressing major crimes like murder and piracy, and (3) punishing treason. In 1346, the Muromachi bakufu added twomore important powers. The first conferred the right to deal with the unlawful cutting of crops - a favorite act of akuto bands. The second, in practical terms, meant the right to carry out the bakufu's orders to confiscate or redistribute land rights. Together, these legal provisions gave the shugo the authority to exercise major judicial and fiscal powers that heretofore had been exercised by organs of the central government." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_467_JpAshik]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by non-government ♣ present ♥</b> The Shogun also had to keep nobles and religious groups on his side, especially as several still legally owned estates that provided taxes and troops, despite many of these provinces being managed by provincial constables in practice. "During the first half of the Muromachi era, however, the Ashikaga shoguns, by occupying the middle ground between these two positions, managed to stave off the demise of the shoen-based nobility for yet another two centuries." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_468_JpAshik] "The first supplementary law, issued in 1337, shows that the bakufu's principal concern was to recall the previously awarded "temporary" tax powers to protect the interests of the most highly placed noble and priestly proprietors. It demanded that lands held by shugo and other military officers for commissariat support "be immediately returned to the estate agents of the civil proprietors." A directive issued in 1338 accused the shugo of abusing this privilege, by taking permanent possession of lands occupied for military support and even distributing them among their own retainers. The bakufu was clearly in a bind. Its primary interest in the provinces was to build up the strength of its shugo; yet it could not deny entirely the interests of the capital nobility and priesthood."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_470_JpAshik][MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Informal critique of executive ♣ present ♥</b> The kanrei acted as an informal critique of the executive for the purpose of advising against actions that could cause resent among the provincial local governors ("shugo") "Nor was the post of kanrei allowed to become monopolized by a single family until the end of the fifteenth century. Rather, it became the practice to pass the appointment among the three foremost shugo houses of Shiba, Hosokawa, and Hatakeyama. These houses, known as the Sankan (the three kanrei), among them held seventeen provinces in Yoshimitsu's day. Together they formed an inner bloc of shugo committed to support the Ashikaga house. The kanrei functioned in two directions. As head of the assembly of senior shugo (yoriai), he gave to the shugo a sense of involvement in bakufu affairs. To the shogun, the kanrei was able to present the shugo's points of view and advise against extreme action that they would resent." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_471_JpAshik] "But with the adoption of the kanrei system, the shogun's relations with the shugo were mediated through the kanrei, and certain decisions were made subject to the assembly of senior shugo. There was, of course, an inherent contradiction in a procedure that put the deputy and the assembly between the shogun and his vassal shugo. A strong-minded shogun, like the mature Yoshimitsu or Yoshinori, resented the restrictions this imposed on his freedom of command. The kanrei-yoriai system as a check on shogunal absolutism worked well up through the time of Yoshikazu, the fifth shogun. And even the sixth shogun, the strong-willed Yoshinori, was forced to accept from time to time the collective will of the kanrei and yoriai." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_472_JpAshik]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal sanction of executive ♣ absent ♥</b> There seems to be no example of an informal fine or penalty for the Shogun, who was (in reality) in a higher position of power of the emperor and beyond punishment.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal constraint on executive ♣ present ♥</b> As discussed above, the Shogun needed to appease several interest groups. There is an example of a Shogun, Yoshinori, attempting to increase the Shogun's authority at the expense of the regional constables by manipulating their lines of successions. This eventually ended in his death, with no immediate consequences for the murderer. This is often thought of as a turning point in which the local lords' came to a wider realization of their independent strength. "speaking of far north and south of Japan The dominant military houses in these regions, left to their own devices, tended to form their own local coalitions through which they tried to ward off outside interference. The difficulty that the Ashikaga shoguns had in maintaining control over the more distant regions of the country was a consequence of their failure both to develop the necessary machinery of government and to acquire the power to impose a full military hegemony. Each area had its special problems." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_473_JpAshik] "The shugo were intensely competitive and frequently switched allegiances to pursue their private interests. Even Yoshimitsu was forced to put down rebellions of trusted shugo, among them the Akamatsu in 1383, the Yamana in 1394, and the Ouchi in 1399. Yoshimitsu's successful termination of the rift between the court factions in 1392 removed a major obstacle to the achievement of a general cooperation between the shogunate and the shugo of central Japan. The bakufu by that time was functioning effectively as a central government, and the shugo found it to be in their best interests to join with, rather than compete against, the bakufu." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_474_JpAshik] "But with the adoption of the kanrei system, the shogun's relations with the shugo were mediated through the kanrei, and certain decisions were made subject to the assembly of senior shugo.

A strong-minded shogun, like the mature Yoshimitsu or Yoshinori, resented the restrictions this imposed on his freedom of command.

And even the sixth shogun, the strong-willed Yoshinori, was forced to accept from time to time the collective will of the kanrei and yoriai.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_475_JpAshik] "Yoshinori's first move was to change bakufu administrative procedures by reorganizing the Corps of Administrators (bugyonin-shu) and instituting what was called the shogunal hearing (gozen-sata). Under this procedure, briefs on policy matters were prepared by the administrators and brought directly to the shogun for decision. This meant that in most instances the kanrei was not consulted, as evidenced by the appearance of bugyonin directives that expressed the shogun's will without the customary countersignature of the kanrei. This change was correctly perceived as a move toward greater shogunal personal rule. Another line of action that Yoshinori pursued proved even more disquieting, for it involved the shogun's effort at directly interfering in shugo domestic affairs. Using his authority to approve shugo appointments and inheritances, Yoshinori began to manipulate the lines of succession among shugo houses so as to bring to Kyoto shugo more amenable to his direction. One device in particular available to Yoshinori was his authority to enlist the lesser members of shugo houses into his private military force as guardsmen. Such appointments were usually of second or third sons in shugo families, men not normally in line for the family headship. But as a result of the personal relationship between shogun and guardsmen, the shogun was able to intervene on behalf of those he favored to ensure their succession. This was the motivation for a series of seemingly arbitrary actions taken by Yoshinori that came to a head in 1441. In that year, the shogun appeared to be taking steps to block the appointment of Akamatsu Mitsusuke's chosen heir to the post of shugo in Harima and Bizen. It was to forestall this move that Mitsusuke killed Yoshinori while the shogun was being entertained in the Akamatsu residence in Kyoto. This incident, known as the Kakitsu affair, marks a turning point in Muromachi bakufu history. That a prominent shugo could murder the shogun who was a guest in his own house was disquieting enough but that the murderer could survive the incident and return to his provincial base without suffering an immediate punitive attack." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_476_JpAshik] "The Kakitsu incident brought an end to a brief period of what some have called "shogunal despotism." But the weakening of shogunal power did not lead to a return to kanrei-shugo council ascendancy either. As a result of Yoshinori's meddling, one of the three kanrei houses, the Shiba, was greatly weakened, and the house served as kanrei only once in the ensuing years. In the aftermath of the Kakitsu incident, competition over the post of kanrei was largely confined to the Hosokawa and Hatakeyama houses. Moreover, the nature of the post itself changed. After 1441, the post of kanrei carried little of its former responsibility of supporting the shogun and mediating with the shugo. Rather, the post was regarded as a means to exercise private influence over the bakufu. Because such influence could result in tangible benefits to both the kanrei and his favored shugo, there was a tendency for the shugo houses to divide into factions behind the two remaining kanrei houses."

For this reason, they needed to be appeased "Bureaucratically the Muromachi bakufu closely resembled the Kamakura bakufu, and even inherited a large number of that organ’s former bureaucrats. It established a functional administration, with authority over judicial and other bureaucratic matters, and progressively arrogated to itself rights to rule-making and police enforcement within the vicinity of Kyoto. It did not control large numbers of troops, but its retainer corps was always reliable (like its master, it had no real power base outside thecity), and it held a preponderance of local power. The growth of commercial activity and increased monetization of the economy introduced new areas of civil contention, and new sources of ready wealth. In an environment where goodwill was scarce and gift-giving an integral part of social life, it is easy to have the impression that the Muromachi bakufu’s city administration was akin to a protection racket. However, it was a powerful protector and patron, and it creatively harnessed Zen institutions to provide financial and personnel support for a new area of government activity, foreign relations." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_480_JpAshik] "From the classical Heian era and continuing through the medieval period, Buddhist monasteries (and nunneries) and temple complexes were an integral component of the aristocratic and oligarchic polity. Drawing a modernist distinction between ‘‘secular’’ and ‘‘religious’’ is not particularly meaningful for the premodern era as a whole, and can distract from the understanding of the integrated nature of lives individual and institutional, but we may note that religion was consciously and inextricably interwoven into national life. In general terms, one might understand this institutional Buddhism as one of the two wheels of the vehicle of state (as exemplified in the trope ōbō buppō, law of the monarch and law of the Buddha)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_481_JpAshik] "Two religious centers were actively involved in political matters: the Tendai esoteric complex of Mt. Hiei outside Kyoto (destroyed by Nobunaga in 1571), and the religious city of Nara in which Kōfukuji and Tōdaiji were dominant. A third center, the Shingon esoteric center in the mountain fastness of Mt. Kōya, avoided political controversy. There were of course many other temples throughout the country, generally affiliated through a web of hierarchical and patronage relationships to temples located in the capital and its immediate vicinity. Some individual temples, such as Tōji in Kyoto, enjoyed a special position as protectors of the state, with direct links to the imperial family itself. Most temples enjoyed the support of families, including the imperial, within the oligarchy; aristoctratic offspring not destined for public life were often placed in temples and many of those offspring tended to rise to the top leadership positions within temples. Temples enjoyed a wide array of tax exemptions, and held significant rights in land - in trust or outright - throughout the country, to support their endeavors. While there were a number of sects and teaching traditions represented within Buddhism in Japan, and Buddhism as a whole was central to faith and practice, the esoteric schools of Tendai22 and Shingon were particularly well represented inritual practices and observances on behalf of state  and aristocracy, and in attending to a wide variety of spiritual and psychological needs." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_482_JpAshik] "As a monastic enterprise, Rinzai was able to flourish because it enjoyed widespread support among the political elite of all persuasions. That support was solidified by the adoption of a Gozan or ‘‘Five Mountains’’ system by the Ashikaga bakufu, which gave them official recognition and under which most Zen temples were subsumed." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_483_JpAshik] "Initially the missions were to the direct financial benefit of the Muromachi bakufu and its warrior leadership, and to the Kyoto-based Zen monastic institutions whose monks in effect constituted a foreign service - skilled in Chinese, many had also traveled to China, and they were adept in the forms and protocols of cultural engagement that guided diplomatic negotiation in the East Asian macro-culture." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_484_JpAshik] "When problems arose, for example, rather than simply issuing dictatorial commands, shogunal officials tended instead to admonish religious leaders to enforce“temple law” (jihō) over the people and territories of their keidai. The very existence of “temple law” itself suggests an outstanding degree of autonomy.This is not to say that religious institutions were entirely exempt from forceful shogunal intervention on occasion. It does appear, however, that force alone trumped the otherwise complete control that powerful temples or shrines exercised over their affiliated keidai."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_485_JpAshik]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ absent ♥</b> There does not seem to be a constraint of the Shogun's actions due to their connections with Zen Buddhism, it seems the temples were used skillfully to their advantage.

Conversely, many former ‘barbarians’ became loyal, tax-paying imperial subjects; after a transitional period as imperial ‘captives’ (‘’fushu’’) the erstwhile ‘barbarians’ blended anonymously into Japanese society.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_499_JpAshik] This fits with the Shinto notion that the "origins of the gods are at once the origins of the Japanese islands and the Japanese people" and therefore "Japan is a sacred land" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_500_JpAshik].

In Shinto: “From earliest times, the role of female shamans in Shinto rites is apparent. An incident recorded in the Wei Dynasty records refers to a civil war that was ended when a 13-year-old girl called Himiko was made empress. While this may have been an incident in the kingdom of Yamatai , women empresses both reigned and ruled, especially Empress Jingū (reigned 201- 269) until Empress Kōken (reigned 749- 758) became involved with the would-be usurper Buddhist monk Dōkyō (died 722), after which the office was closed to women.//In spite of Western feminist attacks on the alleged male chauvinism of Japanese society, women in fact have served as priests ( kannushi ), imperial representatives, and in many other offices. Even Japanese Christianity ordained women clergy at least half a century before ordination of women began in a few traditions in Europe and the United States.//Restrictions on women have to do primarily with issues such as menstruation or childbirth, where blood may be found. Blood may be related to new life, but it also may link with death, and therefore creates impurity ( tsumi ) that must be removed by purification ( harai ). This is not a gender issue in the Western sense. The issue is any of the items that create impurity. [...] In spite of some feminist arguments coming from within Japan that Shinto is discriminatory in certain respects, taking into consideration of role of early empresses who practiced shamanism , and the number of women who in later periods led religious movements, especially among the New Religions . Shinto in its history, on the whole, seems to have been relatively open-minded toward women. The position and influence of women seems first to have been challenged and changed with the arrival of the highly male-centered and patriarchal culture of Buddhism from the Asian mainland to an extent that has not yet been fully realized or admitted by many scholars of Buddhism.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_502_JpAshik] In Buddhism: “The attitude of male-dominated Japanese Buddhism has varied in its perspectives on women and the kind of religious lives and roles women were capable of assuming. Sometimes this view was negative toward women, and other times it was significantly more positive. Both Tendai and Shingon Buddhism were headquartered on sacred mountains: Tendai on Mt. Hiei and Shingon on Mt. Koya. On both of these mountains, for much of the medieval and early modern periods women were either forbidden to enter the mountain precincts or severely restricted in where they could go on the mountain. Women, including nuns, were believed to be spiritually inferior to men and to be subject to the ‘five obstructions’ (‘’gosho’’). The idea of the five obstructions asserted that women are unable to attain the five highest spiritual states, including the highest, that of a Buddha.//Some medieval Japanese Buddhist men held favorable views of women and their spiritual abilities. This was especially true among the new Buddhist schools of the Kamakura period. Pure Land traditions, for instance, with their emphasis on the possibility of universal salvation, included women in this view. Women were not only seen as capable of salvation, but were treated as full participants in the religious life. [...] Some Buddhists held the view, based on a Chinese sutra, that women were impure because of the blood associated with menstruation and childbirth. It was believed by these Buddhists that not only were women impure, but that this blood inevitably polluted the nearby water and soil. The result, it was claimed, was that women were condemned to rebirth in one of the nine levels of Buddhist hells unless Buddhist rituals were performed that would obviate this transgression.

Conversely, many former ‘barbarians’ became loyal, tax-paying imperial subjects; after a transitional period as imperial ‘captives’ (‘’fushu’’) the erstwhile ‘barbarians’ blended anonymously into Japanese society.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_506_JpAshik] This fits with the Shinto notion that the "origins of the gods are at once the origins of the Japanese islands and the Japanese people" and therefore "Japan is a sacred land" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_507_JpAshik]. At the same time, Buddhism teaches to cultivate equanimity towards all, including enemies [MAJIDBENAM_REF_508_JpAshik].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ disputed_present_absent ♥</b> Mostly absent, Pure Land Buddhism being the main exception. In Shinto: “From earliest times, the role of female shamans in Shinto rites is apparent. An incident recorded in the Wei Dynasty records refers to a civil war that was ended when a 13-year-old girl called Himiko was made empress. While this may have been an incident in the kingdom of Yamatai , women empresses both reigned and ruled, especially Empress Jingū (reigned 201- 269) until Empress Kōken (reigned 749- 758) became involved with the would-be usurper Buddhist monk Dōkyō (died 722), after which the office was closed to women.//In spite of Western feminist attacks on the alleged male chauvinism of Japanese society, women in fact have served as priests ( kannushi ), imperial representatives, and in many other offices. Even Japanese Christianity ordained women clergy at least half a century before ordination of women began in a few traditions in Europe and the United States.//Restrictions on women have to do primarily with issues such as menstruation or childbirth, where blood may be found. Blood may be related to new life, but it also may link with death, and therefore creates impurity ( tsumi ) that must be removed by purification ( harai ). This is not a gender issue in the Western sense. The issue is any of the items that create impurity. [...] In spite of some feminist arguments coming from within Japan that Shinto is discriminatory in certain respects, taking into consideration of role of early empresses who practiced shamanism , and the number of women who in later periods led religious movements, especially among the New Religions . Shinto in its history, on the whole, seems to have been relatively open-minded toward women. The position and influence of women seems first to have been challenged and changed with the arrival of the highly male-centered and patriarchal culture of Buddhism from the Asian mainland to an extent that has not yet been fully realized or admitted by many scholars of Buddhism.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_509_JpAshik] In Buddhism: “The attitude of male-dominated Japanese Buddhism has varied in its perspectives on women and the kind of religious lives and roles women were capable of assuming. Sometimes this view was negative toward women, and other times it was significantly more positive. Both Tendai and Shingon Buddhism were headquartered on sacred mountains: Tendai on Mt. Hiei and Shingon on Mt. Koya. On both of these mountains, for much ofthe medieval and early modern periods women were either forbidden to enter the mountain precincts or severely restricted in where they could go on the mountain. Women, including nuns, were believed to be spiritually inferior to men and to be subject to the ‘five obstructions’ (‘’gosho’’). The idea of the five obstructions asserted that women are unable to attain the five highest spiritual states, including the highest, that of a Buddha.//Some medieval Japanese Buddhist men held favorable views of women and their spiritual abilities. This was especially true among the new Buddhist schools of the Kamakura period. Pure Land traditions, for instance, with their emphasis on the possibility of universal salvation, included women in this view. Women were not only seen as capable of salvation, but were treated as full participants in the religious life. [...] Some Buddhists held the view, based on a Chinese sutra, that women were impure because of the blood associated with menstruation and childbirth. It was believed by these Buddhists that not only were women impure, but that this blood inevitably polluted the nearby water and soil. The result, it was claimed, was that women were condemned to rebirth in one of the nine levels of Buddhist hells unless Buddhist rituals were performed that would obviate this transgression.

In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_559_JpAshik] “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_575_JpAshik] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_576_JpAshik]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_578_JpAshik]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

The purpose of purification is to remove tsumi (impurity) and kegare (impurity caused by various human conditions) and restore human nature to its primal and pure state. Thus the idea that human nature can in some sense return to its divine origins lies behind all other related concepts.

Hence the importance of purification to effect restoration.// The goal to be achieved by the performance of misogi shuho , purification using water, is the cultivation of reisei , the Shinto ideal of spirituality.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction.

[...] Tsumi included offenses for which a person was responsible as well as calamities over which he or she had no control. Certain acts resulting in bodily harm to others were lumped together with epidemics and natural calamities as forms of tsumi that were referred to as ‘troublesome things’ (magagoto). In general the ancient Japanese equated physical purity and brightness with righteousness and virtue; conversely, physical defilement and darkness were seen as evil and injustice. Ablutions were used as magic rites to eliminate tsumi. The common element that links all tsumi is their danger to the cosmic and social order. The primitive Japanese believed that society and the cosmos were interrelated and that disturbing one could disturb the other. As violations of the normal order of things, tsumi were to be feared because it was thought that they would invite calamity. Improper sexual relations, for instance, might lead to poor harvests.
