[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IdMajap] "The end of Majapahit itself is problematic: later Javanese tradition mentions saka 1400 (1478 C.E.) as the (symbolic) "end of Majapahit." But Ranawijaya still issues inscriptions in 1486 C.E., while Pigafetta, chronicler of Ferdinand Magellan's round-the-world voyage, acknowledge the existence of Magepaher (Majapahit) in 1522 C.E. And a Mahapahit inscription of Pabanolan Pari has been alternatively read as having the year saka 1563 (1541 C.E.). The demise of Majapahit was probably gradual and nondramatic. It is very likely that with the flourishing of trade cities on the northern coast of Java (pasisir), and especially the rise of Demak as a strong Islamic sultanate, Majapahit lost its control of the sea trade routes, then became disintegrated and subsequently exited the historical stage."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IdMajap]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥</b> Majapahit marked a transition to a kingdom with a more powerful centre which could collect revenue and products directly from outlying and subordinate areas rather than just receiving them as tribute or ritual offering. Tax and revenue is sent to the centre, but this relationship is mediated through <i>watek</i> ruled by individuals known as <i>rakrayan</i>, many of which would have once been independent chiefdoms which retained a separate but clearly subordinate identity, though the centre remained neither brave nor powerful enough to totally strip the power of this traditional elite. As time went on, the central court increasingly dealt directly with local indigenous temples and built trade links with the villages, bypassing the <i>watek</i> and offering local temples tax exemption or <i>sima</i> in exchange for loyalty. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IdMajap] Furthermore, the degree of centralisation increased throughout the Majapahit era -  the idea of state evolvmed from fluid Indic mandala as described in the Tuhanaru inscription of 1326, but Jawa bhûmi as conceptualised in the Nagarakërtagama. In this formulation, the state is more stable and integrated politically and economically - it is distinguished from the larger territory that was said to be "in the orbit" of the Majapahit kraton. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IdMajap] However, the generally decentralized system also created powerful and autonomous enclaves in port areas.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IdMajap]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Singhasari Kingdom ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ elite migration ♥</b> Following the Mongol invasion of 1293, Vijaya allied with the Mongols against the enemies of the Singhasari and established a new capital at Majapahit.

It seems unlikely under these circumstances that many would have been able to afford multiple wives. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_357_IdMajap] A source referring to Java dating from around 1500 when Java was still largely Hindu-Buddhist, describes hermits who "do not know women" and high proportions of women in nunneries and widows who lived in retreats rather than joining the funeral pyre of their husbands.

The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is.

Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devi, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions-Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sita. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala."

By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms 'reward' and 'punishment' are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them.

The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler's overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more 'polluting tendencies' than were usual in a Brahmin's life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_455_IdMajap] "The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled <i>Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications</i>. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain 'pure'. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more 'impure' than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore 'polluting' the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont's thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste."

The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms.

The same may be said to be true of law which was an appendage to sacred literature only in the period of the sūtras. Even earlier than the earliest of the known metrical smṛtis, the artha śāstra tradition had recognised that politics and administration were outside the domain of the sacred." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_471_IdMajap] Moreover, it seems that, in Hinduism, punishment or reward for certain behaviours was believed to occur mainly through reincarnation, not through the action of other humans: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths. According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life. Then, after a certain amount of time, the individual would be reborn on earth once again. The mechanism that regulated this system was karman, a word that literally means "action." Every action must have an effect. So, the effects of one’s actions in life determine what one will experience after death, and what kind of life one will have in the next birth. In this way, even if a person does not seem to receive all the rewards or punishments deserved in a particular life, the scales will be balanced in the future."
