Basin or Valley of Mexico is a highlands plateau in central Mexico roughly corresponding to modern-day Mexico City. Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Initial Formative period (c. 2000-1201 BCE). At the start of this period, maize, squash, and other food crops had been domesticated; however, the earliest known pottery and the earliest known settled villages in the region date to a few centuries later, between 1600 and 1400 BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]No population estimates could be found in the consulted literature; however, knowing that the site of Tlatilco (which was rather large for its time, and which was settled toward the end of this period) covered about 65 hectares (i.e. 160 acres),<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> we may estimate that it had a population of between 3,000 and 13,000 people, assuming between 50 and 200 per hectare. No information could be found on the political organisation of settlements at the time, though it is worth noting that, beginning in 1500 BCE, the Basin developed a two-tiered settlement system,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> suggesting perhaps a hierarchical relationship between larger settlements and smaller ones. Moreover, the ability of certain segments of the population to intensify and control access to staples and ceremonial foods likely led to the earliest emergence of social inequalities and political hierarchies.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Giulia Nazzaro ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ David Carballo ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MxInitl&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in squared kilometers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> People.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [3000-13000] ♥</b> Inhabitants.

class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Editor ♣ ♥</b>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Limits_on_Power_of_the_Chief_Executive">Limits on Power of the Chief Executive</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MxInitl&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47" title="Edit section: Limits on Power of the Chief Executive">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div>These codes refer to an explicit or defined right for some group to constrain the activity of the executive in some way, typically through a legal code, but other ways are imaginable (explain in paragraph if other mechanisms found). When coding ‘present’ for each of the below codes, provide explanation and give examples of the constraints being used, or note that the constraints were formalized but are no known instances of its use in practice.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Right to petition executive ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown.

There is a legal mechanism for removing and replacing the head of state[MAJIDBENAM_BR]While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. So there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used. Or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal critique of executive ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal sanction of executive ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal constraint on executive ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal impeachment ♣ ♥</b> Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In this section we are interested in whether religious or supernatural agents impose limits on executive power. These codes refer to both formal, legal restrictions as well as informal constraints including social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. Explain in descriptive section whether the constraint was formal or informal. ‘Religious agents’ here refers to religious groups, their leaders, or even religiously motivated individuals who are not leaders (e.g., Buddhist monks, street preachers)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Critique of executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sanction of executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This refers to religious practices or norms that work to constrain the activity of the executive. This differs from the above code in that this code refers to restrictions imposed without the need for religious ‘agents’ specifically to act. For example, witchcraft accusations or the threat of such accusations could serve to limit the activity of political actors and act as a normative-behavior reinforcement. Explain in paragraph what the institution is and which groups of people are constrained by it.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Impeachment by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Subordination of the chief executive to a religious agent ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. For example, the rulers acknowledge that there is a higher power above them</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Motivation by belief in supernatural agent ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. In this position, code situations when chief executives take on personal costs or otherwise make prosocial or selfless actions where it is stated or believed to be because of internalized religious conviction. For example, a ruler dedicating war spoils to a temple rather than using them for personal benefit. Unlike the previous position (subordination), which can be theoretical, here we are looking for actual instances when leaders were motivated to do prosocial acts by religious considerations[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. There is a broadly agreed-upon or customary mechanism (although perhaps not explicitly spelled out in law – see below) for power transfer.

Provide details (e.g., specified in constitution)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Number of power transitions ♣ ♥</b> All transfers of power of the chief executive/head of state, noting whether it was done according to an orderly, consensual mechanism, or as a result of contested action (e.g., rebellion, coup d’état). Enter the total number of transitions here and list each one in the paragraph. Note Dynastic transitions where applicable</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Number of contested transitions ♣ ♥</b> How many transitions were contested (out of the total entered above), regardless of which party won the contest (i.e. incumbent or contesting agent). 1. We do not count as a contested transition any challenge that begins after 365 days have elapsed of the new reign. Caveat: care must be taken to record cases just after the cut off. We want to know when the conflict started. The reign end date of the previous ruler only tells us when the contest ended. Though a major event (e.g. a battle) can occur one and a half years after the new king's coronation the infighting/contest that lead up to it often begins earlier, such as immediately after the accession, or sometime within the first year. That infighting can be ignored by any historian who wants to simplify the text to mention only the battle. 2. Multiple separate contests within the transition timeframe should be counted as ONE contested transition. (Do not take time searching for the details of multiple separate contests but if all the detail is present in the same text opportunistically record it in the description field). 3. A transition can be contested before the new ruler is officially crowned.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Number of successful overturns ♣ ♥</b> How many contested transitions of power resulted in an overturn of the ruler. This includes breaks in the normal line of succession (i.e. a dynastic succession was broken, a different party or ethnic group took power, or a rebellion resulted in a change to the rules or procedures regarding powers transitions) or when a relative overturns the ruler unexpectedly within the expected line of succession. Note: There will often be 'succession crises' when there is no 'normal line of succession' so that there will be a 'contested transition' with no possibility of a successful overturn: i.e. 1. The dynasty ends with no heir (typical cause of a succession crisis); 2. The previous ruler has died and divided the kingdom between his sons (who then decide to fight for it all); 3. There is no formal succession procedure and every succession is a fight (e.g. Mamluk Sultanate). These cases should not qualify as a successful overturn as nobody is being overturned.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Central_Bureaucracy">Central Bureaucracy</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MxInitl&amp;action=edit&amp;section=54" title="Edit section: Central Bureaucracy">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown.

Diffused means that administrators act largely on their own accord, whether they are aligned with the interests of the ruler or not.

Common examples of supernatural beings are gods and ancestors, including a recently deceased one. In other words, sacrificing humans to follow a high-status individual in the afterlife is a legitimate example of HS. HS is distinct from capital punishment, however, even for offenses against religion (e.g., burning of heretics, punishment of vestals for transgressions). Such practices should be coded as <b>Capital Punishment for Religious Offenses</b>. Execution of 'witches' even if regularly occurring at funerals of a high-status individual is not HS. We can reflect such practices under <b>Capital Punishment for Witchcraft</b>. See Law, Robin. 1985. Human Sacrifice in Pre-Colonial West Africa. African Affairs 84 (334):53-87 for further discussion. There are several distinct categories of HS listed below. First code any special kinds of HS that are present in the (quasi)polity. Then code the general code  based on the codes for special kinds of HS. Note that HS is also coded under Rituals; here, however, we address general features of HS not tied to any particular ritual.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ ♥</b> 0-5/Unknown    To code this HS scale first code special kinds listed below.
