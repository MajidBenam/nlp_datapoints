It was found to be located near modern Boğazkale, Turkey, within the great loop of the Kızılırmak River. Hattusa exerted dominating influence upon the civilizations of the 2nd and 1st millennia BC in Anatolia and Northern Syria. The palaces, temples, trading quarters and necropolis of this political and religious metropolis provide a comprehensive picture of a capital and bear a unique testimony to the disappeared Hittite civilization. The city's fortifications, along with the Lion Gate, the Royal Gate and the Yazılıkaya rupestral ensemble with its sculptured friezes, represent unique artistic achievements as monuments.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Hattusa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1986[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrHatNK].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Nesite; Luwian ♥</b> And many others.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrHatNK] "We find that no fewer than eight languages are represented in the tablet archives of the capital. Probably as many if not more languages were spoken in the streets of the capital every day, some of them quite different from the languages of the archives." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_TrHatNK] "The official language of the kingdom was an Indo-European language called Nesite, which we commonly refer to today as the 'Hittite' language." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrHatNK] Luwian was not the official language but it "very likely became the most widely spoken language of the Late Bronze Age Hittite empire."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrHatNK] "The Cuneiform script was used throughout its history to write a number of different languages, and the Hattusa archives are composed for the most part in their writers' own language, generally termed by us 'Hittite', but by them 'Nesite', i.e. the language of Nesa or Kanes (modern Kultepe), which had presumably been an earlier Hittite centre, before Hattusa in Hatti. ... The Hittites also used the language Akkadian ('Babylonian' to them) as the international language of communication."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrHatNK] Other languages "found in the archives, mostly of ritual and mythological content. These include Hattian, the pre-Hittite language of Hatti, and Hurrian, the language of the Hittites eastern neighbours; also Luwian and Palaic, languages closely related to Hittite, spoken by their kinsmen dwelling respectively to the south and south-west, and to the north-west of Hatti, and constituting with Hittite the IInd millennium B.C. section of the Anatolian group of Indo-European."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrHatNK]<b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b> [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrHatNK]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Hittite Religions ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The period of the Hittite New Kingdom lasts from about 1400-1180 BCE although the dynasty that created it, originating from the city Kumbnani within the Kizzuwatna polity, came to power in the mid-fifteenth century BCE. The rulers of this dynasty were the creators of the Hittite empire, which during the reign of King Suppiluliuma I (1356-1319 BCE) and his successors achieved the greatest prosperity. In the period of its greatest splendor, the Hittite king controlled up to 400,000 squared kilometers of land including the areas of Northern Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The central bureaucracy was relatively sophisticated: a Chief of the Scribes headed up the Hittite chancellery[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrHatNK] whilst a separate administrator, the hazannu, had responsibility for the city of Hattusa.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrHatNK] Keepers of the Royal Storehouses were also important officials.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrHatNK] District governors known as Lord of the Watchtower were appointed for the provinces[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrHatNK] whilst the conquest of Syria c1340 BCE lead to the position of viceroy being created for the important urban centre of Karkamis.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrHatNK] The power of the state was based on the army, which was great for the times - it had iron weapons, armor, and excellent war chariots.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]During the reign of Muwattalli, Ramses II was in power in Egypt, and the war between two most powerful states in the Middle East area resulted in the first written international treaty known to us as " Kadesh Treaty ". Although this treaty was originally written in the Akkadian language, copies in Hittite and Egyptian languages were made.

We can retrace the path of a festival procession as it leaves the palace gate and proceeds along the ceremonial way, exiting the city through the so-called King's Gate, and passing outside the walls before again entering the city through the Lion Gate. We can imagine the processional way lined with the city's inhabitants and foreign visitors, awaiting the spectacle soon to pass by them. In the distance the songs of the musicians, the sounds of the drums, cymbals, tambourines, and castanets can be heard, growing ever louder as the procession approaches. The crowd catches sight of the statue of the divine guest of honour, a gleaming monumental image towering over the celebrants. This is a rare, once-a-year opportunity for the people to see the great god's image, otherwise hidden away in the recesses of his temple from all but the few spe­cially appointed to his service. So too as the procession passes by, the onlookers may gain a passing glimpse of their king and queen, well protected and isolated from the crowd by an entourage of attendants and a phalanx of royal bodyguards. Closer at hand, acrobats, jug­glers, red-robed jesters, dancers performing their steps to lute accompaniment, all in brightly coloured costume, provide entertain­ment for the spectators. Of course their job is primarily to entertain the god. But who among them could fail to play up to a responsive, on-the-spot, crowd in festive mood? The whole atmosphere might seem more appropriate to a carnival procession than to a religious one. But that is what a joyous celebration calls for. That is what the god himself wants. "The processional itinerary includes stops for visits to the city's temples. Here too performers and other attendants are on hand to greet the royal couple at the temple's entrance. A whirling dance of welcome is performed. Hymns are sung or intoned. Throughout the ceremonies to folIow, various cuItic calls are made by designated performers and attendants-'aha!', 'kasmessa!', 'missa!'. The king enters the temple's cella, after thoroughly washing his hands and drying them on a perfumed towel provided by an attendant. He makes libation at the holy places within the cella-an offering table, a hearth, a throne, a window, even a doorbolt. A feast follows. The god is the guest of honour, the king his host. A great variety of meats and breads and pastries have been prepared-under conditions of the strictest hygiene, for the food served to god and king must be free of taint or defilement of any kind. The king again washes his hands, and then breaks one of the loaves. Some are fancily shaped to resem­ble a human figure or part thereof, perhaps a hand, finger, or tongue, some are shaped like animal figures, perhaps a bird, piglet, or cow, some like inanimate objects, perhaps a ball, ring, or wheel. "The king is handed a silver cup brimming with wine and fashioned in the form of a bull or stag. From it he solemnly 'drinks the god'. This is a sacra­mental act. By it the king comes into mystical union with his divine guest, for the cup symbolizes the god himself. God and king are now joined by the other guests. A herald shows them to their places at table. 'The king offers the god the choicest cuts of meat, grilled or roasted, from the sacrificed animals-hearts, livers, kidneys, succulent thighs, and fat (to which the gods were quite partial). The atmos­phere now becomes more relaxed as the rest of the company tuck in. The king winks at his attendants, a sign for the entertainers to appear. The dancers and acrobats have saved their best routines for the occasion, for this is not merely a royal but a divine command performance. The dancers' performance recreates a hunt, its thrills and its dangers. The performers are dressed as leopards, their actions mimicking the graceful movements of the hunters' feline prey. They always ensure that they face towards the king. The highlight of the programme is a wrestling match between two local champions. This is a form of entertainment in which the deity seems to have taken particular delight. When all is done, the meal and the entertainment concluded, the king departs, after once more washing and drying his hands. "Festival processions often took the celebrants and the images of their gods beyond the city limits to holy places in the open country­ side marked off by the huwasi stones. Here too sacrifice was made to the god, and a feast held for him and his worshippers. Once more there was entertainment for the whole company-mock battles, including a contest between two sides representing the 'men of Hatti' and the 'men of Masa' (which the former always won), more wrestling, perhaps a weight-lifting contest, foot races, horse races, and archery contests with the king acting as judge. There were prizes for the winners (tunics for first and second place-getters in a foot race) and sometimes embarrassing but light-hearted penalties for the losers. All in the spirit of the fun and festivity of the occasion." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_217_TrHatNK] "Four major festivals provided the high spots of the fes­tival calendar. Two were held in spring, and at least one in autumn. The spring festivals were the AN.TAH.SUM or 'crocus' festival, and the purulli festival. The nuntarriyashas festival, the 'festival of haste', was celebrated in autumn; this may also have been the season, though less certainly, of the KI.LAM or 'gate-house' festival. "[...] "[...] On the other hand the KI.LAM festival, the 'festival of the gate-house', lasted only three days and was confined entirely to the capital and its immediate environs. The term 'gate-house' indicates visits to a number of locations, with the procession commencing from the gate of the royal palace and passing to the gates of various temples and storehouses and apparently the city's treasury. The procession fea­tured the Storm God, whose image was brought from his temple for the occasion and paraded through the streets in an ox-drawn car­riage. But many other deities, over thirty of them, were also hon­oured in the festival." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_218_TrHatNK] KI.LAM has been selected as the largest festival because, of the four major festivals, it was the only one that did not "travel": therefore, it seems more likely that it attracted people from other parts of the polity to the capital.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> "The nuntarriyashas festival, the 'festival of haste', was celebrated in autumn; this may also have been the season, though less certainly, of the KI.LAM or 'gate-house' festival."

However, for the purposes of Seshat, the most widespread type of ritual appears to be what the Hittites called SISKUR, that is, "magical procedures often performed by and for individuals to address specific mala­dies." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_250_TrHatNK]. It would appear that many of these rituals did, in fact, involve more than one person (often, there was the person who performed the ritual, and the one it was performed for), and that, though there was great variety in terms of what these rituals involved, there are a sufficient number of "core elements" that a generic SISKUR ritual could be coded here. A particularly well-known category of SISKUR is the "substitution ritual"--again, there were many types of this, but a generic form of it could be coded. "Animals commonly featured in rituals as Substitute victims­ preferably live ones, though as we have seen above, clay replicas were permissible for budget-constrained clients. Asses, oxen, birds, dogs, sheep, and pigs were all considered appropriate for substitu­tion purposes. Thus in a ritual designed to restore harmony to a strife-torn household: "'They drive up a black sheep, the Old Woman presents it to them (the sacrifi­cers-i.e. the pair who have hired the Old Woman), and speaks as follows: 'For your heads and all parts of your bodies the black sheep is a substitute. In its mouth and its tongue is the tongue of curses.' She waves it over them. The two sacrificers spit into its mouth. They cut up the sheep and dismem­ber it, kindle the hearth and burn it. ... The Old Woman takes a small pig. She presents it to them and speaks as follows: 'See! It has been fattened with grass and grain. Just as this one shall not see the sky and shall not see the other small pigs again, even so let the evil curses not see these sacrificers either!' She waves the small pig over them, and then they kill it. They dig a hole in the ground and put it down into it.' "The substitute serves as a kind of receptacle for the pollutants and evil forces which have been afflicting those for whom the ritual has been conducted, and the ritual process involves the transfer of these contaminants from sufferer to substitute. The transfer may be effected by a number of means-by verbal identification of the bodily parts of the substitute with those of the sufferer, by fashioning a substitute image in the likeness of the sufferer, on the principle that like attracts like, by the sufferer touching the substitute or spitting into its mouth, or by simply waving the substitute at or over the sufferer. Of course the process of merely transferring contaminants to a substitute does not eliminate them, any more than we solve a garbage problem by tossing our domestic waste into our neighbour'S backyard. In the course of the ritual, or after it had been completed, it was essential to ensure the correct disposal of the contaminants. Failure to do so could be construed as a wilful act of sorcery, liable for judgement before the king's court with possible dire consequences."[...]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ 2 ♥</b> Though SISKUR have been defined as "magical procedures often performed by and for individuals to address specific mala­dies" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_251_TrHatNK], many of the examples provided by Bryce [MAJIDBENAM_REF_252_TrHatNK] suggest that, in many cases, besides the 'Old Woman' (ritual specialist), the person for whom the ritual was being performed was also an active participant.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> doctors; augurs; priests; hasawa, literate men and women "Prominent amongst the experts in ritual procedure, which included many males, were a group of female practitioners whom we commonly refer to as the 'Old Women' misleadingly so if the term conjures for us the notion of a pack of toothless, half-crazed old crones. The Hittite term for them is hasawa, perhaps originally used of midwives, since it literally means not 'old woman' but rather '(she) of birth'. At all events the women so designated were multi-skilled professionals who may often have collaborated with doctors, augurs, incantation priests, and other practitioners in the arts of ritual performance, healing, and divination.

The image became the god's earthly casing. His physical needs now had to be attended to. On a daily basis he had to be washed, anointed, dressed in clean garments, and given food and drink. This was the task of duly appointed priests and other temple officials. Precise instructions were laid down for the services to be performed. Firstly there was insistence on absolute cleanliness of food preparation areas and those who were to prepare it: "'Those who prepare the daily loaves must be clean. They must be bathed and groomed, and their hair and nails removed. They must be clothed in clean garments. They must not prepare the loaves while in an unclean state. The bakery where the loaves are baked must be swept and scrubbed. Further, no pig or dog is permitted at the doors of the place where the loaves are broken.' "Anyone guilty of serving the god from an unclean vessel was made to drink urine and eat excrement as punishment. More severe were the penalties for those who prepared the god's food while in an unclean state, as a result of having the previous night engaged in sexual inter­ course. A kitchen-hand of the god who had so indulged must bathe at the following sunrise, before having any contact with the god's food. Failure to do so incurred the death penalty-a punishment imposed upon any other servant who had knowledge of his fellow's unclean state and failed to report it. "The death penalty was also prescribed for misappropriating the food and drink that had been prepared for the god-bread, beer, and wine: 'If you ever take sacrifices which have been placed before the gods and fail to convey them to the gods themselves, and you with­ hold them from the gods, and keep them in your own houses, and your wives, children, or servants consume them, or if you give them to the god in several portions-you will be held responsible for dividing them. Do not divide them. He who does so shall be killed.' "On a daily basis, a meal was placed on an offering table before the god's image. What happened to the food and drink which the god did not consume? The instructions to the temple officials take account of this necessary consideration by giving permission to the officials to consume, within three days, anything left over from the god's meal."

We can retrace the path of a festival procession as it leaves the palace gate and proceeds along the ceremonial way, exiting the city through the so-called King's Gate, and passing outside the walls before again entering the city through the Lion Gate. We can imagine the processional way lined with the city's inhabitants and foreign visitors, awaiting the spectacle soon to pass by them. In the distance the songs of the musicians, the sounds of the drums, cymbals, tambourines, and castanets can be heard, growing ever louder as the procession approaches. The crowd catches sight of the statue of the divine guest of honour, a gleaming monumental image towering over the celebrants. This is a rare, once-a-year opportunity for the people to see the great god's image, otherwise hidden away in the recesses of his temple from all but the few spe­cially appointed to his service. So too as the procession passes by, the onlookers may gain a passing glimpse of their king and queen, well protected and isolated from the crowd by an entourage of attendants and a phalanx of royal bodyguards. Closer at hand, acrobats, jug­glers, red-robed jesters, dancers performing their steps to lute accompaniment, all in brightly coloured costume, provide entertain­ment for the spectators. Of course their job is primarily to entertain the god. But who among them could fail to play up to a responsive, on-the-spot, crowd in festive mood? The whole atmosphere might seem more appropriate to a carnival procession than to a religious one. But that is what a joyous celebration calls for. That is what the god himself wants. "The processional itinerary includes stops for visits to the city's temples. Here too performers and other attendants are on hand to greet the royal couple at the temple's entrance. A whirling dance of welcome is performed. Hymns are sung or intoned. Throughout the ceremonies to folIow, various cuItic calls are made by designated performers and attendants-'aha!', 'kasmessa!', 'missa!'. The king enters the temple's cella, after thoroughly washing his hands and drying them on a perfumed towel provided by an attendant. He makes libation at the holy places within the cella-an offering table, a hearth, a throne, a window, even a doorbolt. A feast follows. The god is the guest of honour, the king his host. A great variety of meats and breads and pastries have been prepared-under conditions of the strictest hygiene, for the food served to god and king must be free of taint or defilement of any kind. The king again washes his hands, and then breaks one of the loaves. Some are fancily shaped to resem­ble a human figure or part thereof, perhaps a hand, finger, or tongue, some are shaped like animal figures, perhaps a bird, piglet, or cow, some like inanimate objects, perhaps a ball, ring, or wheel. "The king is handed a silver cup brimming with wine and fashioned in the form of a bull or stag. From it he solemnly 'drinks the god'. This is a sacra­mental act. By it the king comes into mystical union with his divine guest, for the cup symbolizes the god himself. God and king are now joined by the other guests. A herald shows them to their places at table. 'The king offers the god the choicest cuts of meat, grilled or roasted, from the sacrificed animals-hearts, livers, kidneys, succulent thighs, and fat (to which the gods were quite partial). The atmos­phere now becomes more relaxed as the rest of the company tuck in. The king winks at his attendants, a sign for the entertainers to appear. The dancers and acrobats have saved their best routines for the occasion, for this is not merely a royal but a divine command performance. The dancers' performance recreates a hunt, its thrills and its dangers. The performers are dressed as leopards, their actions mimicking the graceful movements of the hunters' feline prey. They always ensure that they face towards the king. The highlight of the programme is a wrestling match between two local champions. This is a form of entertainment in which the deity seems to have taken particular delight. When all is done, the meal and the entertainment concluded, the king departs, after once more washing and drying his hands. "Festival processions often took the celebrants and the images of their gods beyond the city limits to holy places in the open country­ side marked off by the huwasi stones. Here too sacrifice was made to the god, and a feast held for him and his worshippers. Once more there was entertainment for the whole company-mock battles, including a contest between two sides representing the 'men of Hatti' and the 'men of Masa' (which the former always won), more wrestling, perhaps a weight-lifting contest, foot races, horse races, and archery contests with the king acting as judge. There were prizes for the winners (tunics for first and second place-getters in a foot race) and sometimes embarrassing but light-hearted penalties for the losers. All in the spirit of the fun and festivity of the occasion." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_343_TrHatNK] "Four major festivals provided the high spots of the fes­tival calendar. Two were held in spring, and at least one in autumn. The spring festivals were the AN.TAH.SUM or 'crocus' festival, and the purulli festival. The nuntarriyashas festival, the 'festival of haste', was celebrated in autumn; this may also have been the season, though less certainly, of the KI.LAM or 'gate-house' festival." "Of the two spring celebrations, the AN.TAH.SUM festival was per­formed 'for the Sun Goddess of Arinna and the gods of the Hatti Land'. Lasting some thirty-eight days, its rites took place in Hattusa and other important religious centres of the homeland. It had much in common with the purulli festival, which lasted for just under a month. So named from the Hattian word for 'earth', this festival belongs within the old Hattic tradition, and features the originally Hattic deities Telipinu, the Storm God, and Inar(a). The king and queen were again the chief officiants. Beginning in Hattusa the festi­val procession passed through a number of towns, inclUding Arinna, the city of the Sun Goddess and a day's journey from the capital, before reaching its destination. Traditionally this was Nerik, the city in the northern part of the homeland dedicated particularly to the worship of the Storm God. Here the festivities reached their climax. Here there was a general assemblage of gods for the occa­sion, just as in Babylon all the gods gathered in deference to their chief Marduk, to celebrate the year's beginning."[...] "The spring festival, which reached its climax in Nerik, celebrated the regeneration of the powers of nature. It was a time of renewals, of reconfirmation of the gods' endorsement of the king's authority, of regeneration of the life and health and vigour of the king and his consort. There was a direct connection between the king's well­ being and the rhythm of nature which was essential to the growth process."

As we have noted, Arma- Tarhunda was related to the royal family, and had the misfortune to be the arch-rival of the king’s brother Hattusili, later to occupy the throne as Hattusili III. Prior to this Muwatalli had made his brother governor of the Upper Land in place of Arma-Tarhunda, much to the latter’s fury. It was Hattusili who had brought the charge of witchcraft, to counter an indictment which Arma-Tarhunda had brought against him:‘Furthermore he and his wife and his son began to bewitch me. He also filled Samuha, the city of the deity, with witch- craft.’65 One cannot help suspecting that Arma-Tarhunda’s charge (whatever it may have been) was not unjustified, and Hattusili's a trumped-up one; it was certainly well within the capability of the wily and ruthlessly ambitious young prince to resort to such measures to rid himself of an inconvenient rival. In any case Muwatalli found against the defendant, and handed him over to Hattusili for punishment, thus ensuring the removal of one of the chief obstacles in his brother’s career path. Yet Hattusili’s treatment of Arma-Tarhunda was surprisingly mild: he let him go free and returned to him half his confiscated property; subsequently he attempted a reconciliation with his family. All this, he claims, he did out of pity, for Arma- Tarhunda was now an old man. More likely he was acting out of remorse—for a charge unjustly laid.The mere allegation of witchcraft may well have generated concerns and emotions which were almost sufficient in themselves to secure a conviction. To judge from the Proclamation of King Telipinu, even a knowledge of the black arts rendered one liable to prosecution. And persons who knew of but failed to denounce those suspected of having such knowledge were themselves liable to punishment: ‘In Hattusa hereafter sorcery must be exorcized. Whoever in the (royal) family knows about sorcery, you must seize him and bring him to the gate of the palace.

On the other hand, offences commit- ted by slaves attracted only half the penalty of those committed by free persons (for example, clauses 101, 121). If the slaves themselves were responsible for paying the compensation, and that is how the clauses appear to read, then we obviously have to do with slaves who were persons of independent means—as indeed a number of slaves in Hittite society appear to have been (see below). Yet the ultimate responsibility for compensating a victim of a slave’s actions must have been borne by the master himself, just as he was responsible for damage done to a neighbour’s property by his livestock.

" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_637_TrHatNK] "Evidence seems to be mounting for widespread famine in the kingdom in the last years of its existence. There were urgent appeals for grain to be sent to the land of Hatti— a matter of life or death! If there were such a famine, was it necessarily due to climatic conditions? We have suggested that Hatti was becoming increasingly dependent on imported grain in the last decades of the Bronze Age, much of this grain coming from Egypt. The first indication of serious food shortages in Hatti had appeared in one of Queen Puduhepa’s letters to Ramesses, urging him to take over as soon as possible the horses, cattle, and sheep forming part of the Hittite princess’s dowry because, she claims, ‘I have no grain left in my lands.’ But chronic shortfalls in Hatti’s own grain production may have been due as much to a major redeployment of manpower from its agricultural workforce as to poor rainfall and other factors of nature."

The storehouses were of considerable importance to the kingdom, both militarily and economically. They served as clearing houses for income due to Hattusa, as produce redistribution centres in the local area, and it seems too that they constituted a network of armouries for the Hittite militia.12 It was clearly essential that their keepers be utterly trustworthy. These were no doubt the reasons why such relatively lowly officials were required to report directly to the king, and were directly accountable to him.13 " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_639_TrHatNK]  Food was stored by individuals, but the polity also created special buildings for storing food.

We have important new information about the nature of some of these facilities from the recently discovered silos in Hattusa. Eleven underground grain pits have been excavated on the mountain ridge now called Büyükkaya on the city’s north-eastern extremity. And behind the so-called ‘postern wall’ on the south-west of the Lower City, an underground storage complex consisting of two parallel rows of sixteen chambers each has come to light.10 Dr Seeher, the excavator, has estimated a storage space ranging from a possible minimum of 128 to a possible maximum of 648 cubic metres for the individual silos on Büyükkaya, and a total storage space of up to 9,800 cubic metres for the postern wall complex. In terms of weight, the latter had a maximum holding capacity of some 5,880 tonnes of grain, a sufficient annual ration for up to 32,000 people. There were undoubtedly other grain silos, both underground and above-ground, built in the city throughout its history,11 as also in the kingdom’s regional administrative centres.

The reason for this, it seems, was to ensure that henceforth he avoided all contact with items which had been ‘contaminated’ by him during the period of affliction, and were likely to recontaminate him after his period of purification. (So too the implements used in cleansing a patient of the pollution which was impairing his reproductive functions were thrown into a river, along with his clothes, to ensure that they could never again affect the patient or anyone else.20) The Hittites had no understanding of the transmission of diseases by biological processes. None the less, the oracle had given instructions for the removal and burning of objects infected by contact with their afflicted owner. In scientific terms, Mursili’s affliction was not a contagious one.Yet there was almost certainly an empirical basis to the oracle’s advice: objects contaminated by contact with a dis- eased person can themselves become sources of ongoing contamina- tion unless they are removed and destroyed. The ravages of plague, like the one which devastated the Hittite land before and during Mursili’s reign, gave good reason to believe that disease could be spread by physical contact, even if the scientific reasons for this were not known and no distinction was made between diseases which were transmittable and those which were not: some diseases were seen to be transmitted from an object to a person or from one person to another by proximity or physical contact, and therefore all diseases, like all forms of pollution, were transmittable in this way."

Female labour could also be hired, at half that rate. But the rate and method of payment probably varied, depending on the period of the year and the nature of the work required. Thus The Laws stipulate that in the harvest season: ‘If a (free) man hires himself out for wages, to bind sheaves, load them on wagons, deposit them in barns, and clear the threshing floors, his wages for three months shall be 1,500 litres of barley. If a woman hires herself out for wages in the harvest season, her wages for three months shall be 600 litres of barley’ (clause 158). Payment in kind was clearly the most convenient form of remuneration at this time. The labourer simply took a share of the grain harvested and stored it for consumption by his family in the period before the next harvest. Professor Hoffner has calculated that 1,500 litres of barley equates to 3.75 shekels of silver, slightly better than the standard rate of one shekel of silver per month for a male, although the woman’s remuneration of 600 litres, equated to one shekel of silver, is worse than the standard rate of half a shekel for one month’s hire. The difference between the male and female hire rates may well be a reflection of the different work each was required to do, with the more physically demanding tasks reserved for the male (as suggested by clause 158 above). On the other hand women shared in many of the tasks undertaken by men, particularly at times of labour shortages, whether due to plague, or absence of males on military campaigns, or redeployment of males for work on public projects. More generally we hear of women employed in a range of manual activities—as millers, cooks, weavers, and fullers as well as in more specialist occupations as doctors and ritual practitioners. Elsewhere they appear as musicians, dancers, and tavern-keepers."
