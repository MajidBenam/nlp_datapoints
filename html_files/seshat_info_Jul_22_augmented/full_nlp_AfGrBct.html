The Greekness of Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek religion is, however, more difficult to defend. The religious practices of people who asserted, in public discourse, and especially political imagery, a connection with Greeks and Greece were diverse. Greek gods were depicted on coins and temple images, but whether in the use of Near Eastern temple designs or in the dedication of Buddhist relics, Greek cults were only part of the religious constellation of the region. [...] As well as the cults of Greek gods, other religions flourished in the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdoms. In Bactria, the river Oxus was worshipped, and the archaeological evidence is also suggestive of the existence of other local and Near Eastern cults, both within the precincts of shrines such as the Ai Khanoum temples and the Temple of the Oxus, and in independent locations. In India, we find evidence of the importance of Buddhism and the cults of Indian gods both to the region's inhabitants, Greek and non-Greek, and in political display.//"There was considerable flexibility in iconography and religious practice in the Hellenistic Far East: sites might serve as foci of multiple religious rites, perhaps with different ethnic 'slants', and be patronized by more than one ethnic group, or by individuals with a more complex personal ethnic identity. The use of multiple names for the same temple or divine image need not necessarily have operated at the level of officially orchestrated or approved syncretism. But if this did occur, as I suspect it did, it may have allowed diverse ethnic communities to use the same site without the necessity of 'appropriating' the deity and its worship for any particular ethnic affiliation. This is not to impute any degree of 'split personality' to the identity and iconography of the divinity. Greeks may have looked at the 'Dioskouroi' at Dil'berdzhin and seen one thing, and local Bactrians may have looked at them and seen another (how would a Greek and a Bactrian have referred to them in conversation with one another?). On the other hand, it is possible that people who looked at such an image did so with a conscious awareness that it was more all-encompassing, something that could have the attributes of one god without denying its identity as the other."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ Buddhism ♥</b> "In India, we find evidence of the importance of Buddhism and the cults of Indian gods both to the region's inhabitants, Greek and non-Greek, and in political display."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom was a hereditary monarchy founded in the mid-3rd century BCE, probably by the Seleucid satrap Diodotus I,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_AfGrBct] as a successor kingdom of the Seleucid Empire.

But if these regional officials were initially directly loyal to the central monarchy at the capital Bactra, by 126 BCE the Chinese chronicler Zhang Qian could claim that Bactria had 'no great ruler but only a number of petty chiefs ruling the various cities'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_AfGrBct][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Greco-Bactrian army was based on the same model as that of the Macedonian-Seleucids, with innovations in tactics based on exposure to nomadic horsemen.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_AfGrBct] The Bactrian Greeks were equipped in the Macedonian style adopted by their Seleucid forebears.

So far, only two of these have seen extensive excavation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_AfGrBct] There is also evidence that Bactria was fertile and extensively irrigated.

The region was surrounded by irrigated lands had a military base and diverse cultural life. The 6,000 may provide a lower limit for an estimate. The loose correlation between the seating-capacity of any settlement's largest theatre and its peak population size might assist an improved estimate. The largest Greek cities had theatres with seating-capacity of up to 17,000. If Ai Khanoum's theatre was one third of the size, then its population might be that much less than the population of the largest Greek city (100k?).[MAJIDBENAM_BR] For an upper limit for the population at Ai Khanoum we could look at Samarkand in 300 BCE which may have had 100,000. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_AfGrBct] (No estimate for 200 BCE, however Samarkand still in existence at this time).

Derived from the experience of ancient Greece, which was multisided by definition, it is characterized as for its substance by a high level of unity; as for its sources, it appears essentially as a customary law, which has its basis not in the legislation of a city or a sovereign, but in notary practice. Because it is not the law of a limited group, as were the nomoi of the classical Greek cities or of the ethne ̄ it is within the reach of all who can fit the definition of a “Hellene,” through adherence to Greek culture and an origin foreign to the conquered country; in this respect, the case of the Jews of Egypt is particularly significant. After the Hellenistic monarchies were reduced to the state of Roman provinces, Hellenistic law survived under the Principate in the practice of the provinces of the East."

Some noble families from Stakhr were settled by Seleucus I in Karka (Upper Mesopotamia).3 Further, the Greek polis invented naturalization. An alien could not be made Persian, buta Persian could become a citizen of a Greek polis. Naturalized, he would have to pay homage to the gods of the city, but he was not expected to abandon his ancestral gods. [...] Thus, Greek society was an open and changing society. There was no hereditary nobility of big landowners as in Iranian Iran."

The Greekness of Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek religion is, however, more difficult to defend. The religious practices of people who asserted, in public discourse, and especially political imagery, a connection with Greeks and Greece were diverse. Greek gods were depicted on coins and temple images, but whether in the use of Near Eastern temple designs or in the dedication of Buddhist relics, Greek cults were only part of the religious constellation of the region.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"[...][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"As well as the cults of Greek gods, other religions flourished in the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdoms. In Bactria, the river Oxus was worshipped, and the archaeological evidence is also suggestive of the existence of other local and Near Eastern cults, both within the precincts of shrines such as the Ai Khanoum temples and the Temple of the Oxus, and in independent locations. In India, we find evidence of the importance of Buddhism and the cults of Indian gods both to the region's inhabitants, Greek and non-Greek, and in political display.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"There was considerable flexibility in iconography and religious practice in the Hellenistic Far East: sites might serve as foci of multiple religious rites, perhaps with different ethnic 'slants', and be patronized by more than one ethnic group, or by individuals with a more complex personal ethnic identity. The use of multiple names for the same temple or divine image need not necessarily have operated at the level of officially orchestrated or approved syncretism. But if this did occur, as I suspect it did, it may have allowed diverse ethnic communities to use the same site without the necessity of 'appropriating' the deity and its worship for any particular ethnic affiliation. This is not to impute any degree of 'split personality' to the identity and iconography of the divinity. Greeks may have looked at the 'Dioskouroi' at Dil'berdzhin and seen one thing, and local Bactrians may have looked at them and seen another (how would a Greek and a Bactrian have referred to them in conversation with one another?). On the other hand, it is possible that people who looked at such an image did so with a conscious awareness that it was more all-encompassing, something that could have the attributes of one god without denying its identity as the other."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_481_AfGrBct]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=AfGrBct&amp;action=edit&amp;section=67" title="Edit section: Deification of Rulers">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred continuity with the Seleucids.

"The faith of Seleucus I was of a somewhat conservative nature, and Antiochus I likened his father to Zeus by bestowing on him the title Nicator, thereby establishing a precedent for the official deification of kings after their death. It is possible that the example of Ptolemy II Philadelphus had some influence in the case of Antiochus II whose title Theos cannot have been just an empty word; and although this kind of deification was at first only a local phenomenon (in Miletus), his coins none the less depict Hercules on the rock, Apollo on the omphalos and the horned horse's head - now heraldically stylized. By contrast, Seleucus II Callinicus made virtually no attempt to spread his own cult but was active in encouraging the cult of Apollo and Athene; moreover he combined the cult of the dead queen Stratonice Thea with that ofher protectress Aphrodite. He did not have his own title put on his coins. Neither did Seleucus III Soter and Antiochus III the Great, who stamped the image of Apollo or an elephant on the reverse of their coins - the elephant here having nothing to do with Indian theories of monarchy.2 Even more striking is the absence of any charismatic or mythical references in the consolidation of the dynastic cult under Antiochus III. Only one decree is compiled on the assumption that the kings but not the queens had cults in their lifetime, that from Antioch in Persis3 which lists with their usual titles all the kings from Seleucus I to Antiochus III (together with his eldest son)."

However, exceptions were permitted among powerful men for dynastic reasons, especially during the Hellenistic period (Alexander is a good example, and also the Ptolemies). And throughout Greek history, even ordinary men could have a concubine (pallakis), visit prostitutes, conduct affairs with boys, etc. There was no presumption of male sexual fidelity as a part of the marital state. That was strictly for wives. It was considered in bad taste to keep a concubine in the same house as one’s wife, but that was just about the only restriction. In general, the philosophers said that sexual desire was something men must suppress in order to achieve the good life; they thought that friendship was the most important value and it should always take precedence over sex. [...] The bottom line is that monogamy was the cultural expectation (supported by religion in the sense that even Zeus and Poseidon and Hades only had one wife each). The philosophers did not make much headway in changing this, and where they did, it was more in favor of abstinence (either with or without marriage) than of polygamy.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_504_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them).

A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community. Just as Hesiod connects the bad man with injustice and religious danger, so he presents moral righteousness and adherence to justice (δίκη‎) as coexisting with ritual correctness. Gregory Nagy points out that in Op. 336-41, a passage which follows the lines quoted above, the moral correctness of δίκη‎ is ‘programmatically re-enforced by the ritual correctness of the just man’:26 Perses is again reminded that gods punish unjust deeds (ἄδικα ἔργα‎; vv. 325-34), and that he should often sacrifice purely and cleanly to the deathless gods and propitiate them often with libations and incense (vv. 336-41). Religious correctness is thus laid out as avoiding unjust deeds and as honouring the gods with sacrifices and libations.//"In vv. 325-34 the following deeds are listed as unjust (ἄδικα ἔργα‎): gaining wealth by force, stealing, or deception; wronging a suppliant or a guest; engaging in illicit sexual intercourse; offending orphans or aged parents. These offences span both the social and religious spheres. This is stressed at the end of the passage, where Hesiod states that such deeds provoke the anger of Zeus himself, who inflicts grave punishments (vv. 333-4). Effectively, Zeus holds the transgressor in <i>agos</i>. To sum up, in Hesiod’s poem, justice is represented as a goddess and as a law given to humans by Zeus. It governs all social and religious relationships; it encompasses religious correctness. Moral goodness equals adherence to justice, whereas ‘badness’ (κακία‎ or κακότης‎) is equal to injustice and religious transgression."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_540_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of kinship obligations ♣ present ♥</b> "Although Homer's epic depicts a few exceptional figures like Tantalos and Sisyphos receiving punishment in the underworld (<i>Od.</i> 11 576-600), elaborate descriptions of underworld retributions come mostly from later sources, causing some scholars to suppose that a compensatory afterlife is a later invention.

The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity. The intensity of the contact with the divinity corresponds directly to the intensity of the purity required for the worshipper and to the severity of the divine punishment if this requirement is violated."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_543_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ general supernatural enforcement of morality ♣ present ♥</b> "Although Homer's epic depicts a few exceptional figures like Tantalos and Sisyphos receiving punishment in the underworld (<i>Od.</i> 11 576-600), elaborate descriptions of underworld retributions come mostly from later sources, causing some scholars to suppose that a compensatory afterlife is a later invention.

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor - it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_547_AfGrBct] Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b>  “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_548_AfGrBct] Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “It depends on what kind of authority. The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_549_AfGrBct] Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As I have suggested at the beginning of this paper, the idea that a ritually cleaned body cannot free a person from guilt and cannot be a sufficient requirement for a harmonious relationship between mortals and immortals can be understood as an implicit criticism of rituals. We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_550_AfGrBct] Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Piety required respect for one’s parents, especially in regard to making the annual offerings once they were dead. To mistreat a parent or neglect a parental tomb was a sign of moral depravity. Greek city-states legislated that children owed their parents food, lodging and burial (this goes back to Solon, the first lawgiver at Athens); those who failed in this duty could have their citizenship rights revoked. The worst crimes imaginable were incest with a parent and killing one’s own parent. Killing one’s own child did not carry the same weight of horror, although any kin-murder was considered more serious than murder of non-kin. The expectations for ritual purification after killing made these types of distinctions, and they could be regarded as a form of “regulation.” The Greeks recognized both written and unwritten laws. In general, the need to obey and respect parents was much, much stronger than any parental obligation to a child. Greek fathers throughout antiquity had the right to “expose” offspring they rejected at birth, which meant abandoning the infant either in the wild or in a place known to be used for that purpose, where it might or might not be picked up by slave traders. This did not count as murder, although once the infant was acknowledged by the father and accepted into the household, that would be a different matter. The Kyrene religious law code of the 4th century BCE says that “a man is bound as far as his brother’s children,” meaning that religious obligation (such as paying a fine levied for religious offense on a nephew) extended that far, and only on the paternal side.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_551_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Yes, this was definitely a “promoted value.” The Greeks called it either andreia (lit. “manliness”) or arete(“excellence”). A boy’s first school text was the Iliad, and he had to memorize long passages and write them out (or suffer beatings). As you know, this text is much concerned with the display of manly prowess in combat, which was the ultimate test of andreia. Evidence of cowardice (such as wounds taken in the back, or throwing away a shield in order to run) could ruin a man’s reputation in life or death. Plutarch wrote a book “On the Arete of Women,” in which he describes women who behaved in unexpectedly brave ways (usually by showing physical courage, fighting invaders, or counseling their men against cowardice). Some citations from the Hellenistic author Polybius: 5.111: King Attalus brought Gauls over from Europe as mercenaries because of their reputation for andreia. 6.46: [Citing unnamed sources] ‘For [they say that there are] two things on which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—andreia in the face of the enemy and concord at home.’ 27.8 [Deliberations by the Macedonian general Perseus after a victory]: ‘after this taste of Macedonian andreia, the Romans will be much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or harsh burden upon the Macedonians.’” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_552_AfGrBct]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “I recommend the chapter “Greek law in the Hellenistic period” in M.

First cousin, half-sibling and uncle-niece marriages were permitted or even required for heiresses, in order to keep property within the paternal family.
