The population of the largest settlement was probably in the region of 500 people - but a population is not thought to have been resident at the site that later became Cahokia until towards the end of the period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In this period the trends established in the Sponemann-Collinsville-Loyd Period continued. Maize farming was intensified and consumption increased creating higher yields and needs for storage and larger populations.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_USMisME][MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_USMisME] Paregrine and Trubitt (2014) note that Cahokia was an excellent environment for growing maize and its geographic location meant it was easily accessible from many directions.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_USMisME] It is thought that many different groups created the initial settlement at Cahokia, bringing with them a social structure.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_USMisME][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The levels of social complexity in Emergent Mississippian societies were increasing creating specialised social roles for "community defense, organization of labor, and communal storage of maize". Settlements now consisted of court-yard clusters and "toward [1000 CE], the southern pattern of civic-ceremonial centers with large earthen mounds was established in many places."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_USMisME] Warfare appears to have become established. The percentage of sites that were palisaded increased throughout this period from 0.5% 800-950 CE, to 1.5% of sites 1000 CE, to 3% of sites in 1050 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_USMisME] The nucleated nature of the settlements themselves may also have been a "defensive response to bow warfare."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_USMisME]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner; Kalin Bullman ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Peter Peregrine ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=USMisME&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [100-200] ♥</b> in squared kilometers[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Quasi-polities of the American Bottom might cover 100-200 KM2.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [400-500] ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Population of largest settlement probably in region of 500 people and this would be the quasi-polity size.

Most people lived in these nucleated villages, each of which was occupied by at least a few tens of people, and sometimes several times that number. Only a small proportion of the valley's inhabitants lived in houses that were widely separated from one another."  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_USMisME][MAJIDBENAM_BR] "It has been argued that villages with well over a hundred buildings had developed by the late Emergent Mississippian period."

The people who made the Mound 72 points were pushing the limits of what can be accomplished by chipping stone. ... "the length-to-width ratios of the American Bottom points were more uniform than those of the points from distant places." However "High-quality local chert ... is much easier to knap than the coarse-grained Hixton silicified sandstone. In fact, the uniformity of points made with the latter stone indicates that these knappers were able to work a difficult material with great precision." On this and other evidence Milner concludes "there was little, if any, difference among the most skilled knappers in the midcontinent in terms of their ability to produce uniformly shaped arrowheads for special events."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_USMisME]</div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR] figurines and figure-pipes[MAJIDBENAM_BR] certain pottery vessels e.g. Ramey Incised jars[MAJIDBENAM_BR] marine shell beads (which have identified tools: "small chert microdrills and sandstone saws").<div> It is argued that these beads "were among the artifacts that fueled Cahokia-dominated exchange systems that spanned the midcontinent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_USMisME] However "The great majority of beads possessed by even the highest ranked people were of indifferent quality. These beads were identical to those held in far smaller numbers by common people. Only the individuals who held the most exalted positions ... had substantial numbers of especially attractive beads ... at least some of which were part of matched sets of uniformly shaped beads." Milner concludes "there is no compelling reason to believe that bead making was conducted in anything other than domestic settings."

For Cahokia calculations, Erasmus's figures for two carriers were averaged to obtain 1.675 m3 and 0.838 m3 moved in fiver hours over 100 m and 200 m, respectively. Productivity dropped after five hours, so this workday length was retained in the estimates provided here. The American Bottom excavators had to work with clays that were more difficult to dig than sandy Sonoran soils; however their stone hoes were more efficient than mere sticks. ...The distance over which soil was carried has a major effect of the Cahokia labor estimates. Certainly much of the mound fill was derived from borrow pits that dotted the site, several of which were quite large (Fowler 1989). In addition, an unknown, but certainly large, fraction of mound fill consisted of upper soil horizons that had been scraped from broad areas. ... In general, it seems   appropriate to use a distance of 100 m when calculating the labor needed to construct 102 of the mounds. A distance of 200 m was used for Monks Mound, following Reed and coworkers (1968). ... Using these figures, the mounds could have been built in 470,000, 490,000, 155,000, and 86,000 five hour days, distributed across the Lohmann, Stirling, Moorehead, and Sand Prairie phases."

through time, but the basic ritual structure may have remained essentially the same from late prehistory into the Colonial period. Based on the above description, warfare rituals would have included the creation of sacred space; elite involvement and sponsorship of rituals, especially feasting; use of sacred paraphernalia and props such as horns and feathers of supernaturals, plants, crystals, pipes, paints, and consecrated vessels; emphasis on symbolism in food, behavior, and color; consumption of medicines, including the black drink and the war medicine, for ritual cleansing and purification; acquisition, display, and ritual manipulation of war trophies; and ritual performance, including dancing with raptor tails or wings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_162_USMisME] The following provides some information as to the effects of the "black drink": "In addition to being a stimulant, the beverage also acts as a diuretic, causing increased perspiration. And the Indians sometimes used it as an emetic. On these occasions they would drink it in large quantities, and in a quarter to half an hour they would vomit. Sometimes they would hold their arms across their chests and expell [sic] the contents of their stomachs six or eight feet. The Timucuans would drink repeatedly, vomiting it up each time (fig. 56). [...] Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, exciting it at all levels. [...] It enables a person to have a more rapid and clearer flow of thought, makes him capable of more sustained intellectual effort, and sharpens his reaction. It also increases his capacity for muscular work and lessens fatigue. Moreover, some evidence suggests that large doses of caffeine speed up blood clotting. These effects are pronounced with doses of 0.5 to 1.0 grams--the equivalent of three to six cups of strong coffee. When consumed in large quantities, black drink could have delivered at least this much caffeine, and perhaps as much as 3.0 to 4.0 grams. These effects from large quantities of black drink could have been important and even decisive factors in activities such as the ballgame or warfare."
