Neo-Elamite phase c.1000 to conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus the Great in 539 BCE. Neo-Elamite II ends 646 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_1_IrNElm3] The uncertainty in the dates here is due to disagreement about the status of Elam between the Assyrian sack of Susa in 647/6 and before the destruction of the Assyrian city of Nineveh in 612. The traditional interpretation has been that Elam 'became an Assyrian province until the fall of the Assyrian empire and the destruction of Nineveh in 612 BC'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IrNElm3] However, Pierre Amiet, Pierre de Miroschedji, M.-J. Steve and Francois Vallat 'suggest that a Neo-Elamite renaissance - a state of independence rather than subjection to any rival, whether Babylonia or Media - occurred in the wake of Assurbanipal's destruction of Susa'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IrNElm3] Potts commented in 2012 that 'Evidence that Elam became an Assyrian province soon after Assurbanipal's destruction of Susa is equivocal at best. Nor is it clear what role Elam played vis-a-vis the growing power of Babylonia or that of Media'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IrNElm3] It seems that despite the 'ferocity' of Assyrian attempts to eradicate 'Elam as a political and cultural entity',[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrNElm3] the polity continued to exist in diminished and fragmented form after 646 BCE. Carter and Stolper also note that 'contrary to earlier assumptions, the destruction of Susa in 646 B.C. had little effect on the evolution of ceramic or other artifact styles'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ {quasi-polity; confederated state} ♥</b><span style="color:purple">JR: I've coded for scholarly disagreement here. Wouter Henkelman is 'personally convinced' that Elam remained a centralized state after the Assyrian invasions, and that 'it prospered on account of the disappearance of Assyrian pressure (military but especially economic) after the fall of Nineveh. Not everyone subscribes to this view: Daniel Potts still believes in a fragmented state after the 640s. I personally do not see any convincing argument for this'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_IrNElm3]</span>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]After the Assyrian sack of Susa in 646 BCE, 'It looked as if Elam as a state were completely destroyed, but several kinglets still held out in the mountain strongholds, then descended into the lowlands as soon as the Assyrians went away; and at last the Assyrians went for good'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IrNElm3] Some time after about 625 BCE, 'one of the Elamite pretenders seems to have achieved the unification of the devastated kingdom. Later, under the next Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar II, war broke out between Babylonia and Elam (596/5), leading to the capture of Susa by the Babylonians; but, as can be gleaned from Jeremiah 49, the attention of the Babylonian king was riveted on other more important political matters elsewhere, and it seems that Elam again regained its independence (Jeremiah 49.39)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrNElm3] However, writing more recently, Waters gives us a more fragmented picture: 'It has become the norm to envisage contemporaneous, Neo-Elamite kings ruling independent principalities throughout southwestern Iran - not only in Susiana - in the roughly 100 years between the sack of Susa and Cyrus the Great's conquest of the Medes'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Neo-Assyrian Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Achaemenid Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ scale of supra-cultural interaction ♣  ♥</b>km squared.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Capital ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Elamite ♥</b> "The Elamite written language was used as the official language in the bureaucracy for a long time, rivaling the Sumerian and Akkadian languages even over a thousand years later, during the Old Persian Empire of the Achaemenids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ language isolate ♥</b> Elamite is a language 'of unknown linguistic affiliation'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IrNElm3] but may be related to the Dravidian languages of South Asia.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IrNElm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Our Neo-Elamite III period begins in 647 BCE, the date of the invasion of Elam and sack of the ancient city of Susa by the Neo-Assyrian king Ashurbanipal,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IrNElm3] and ends in 539 BCE. This date marks the capture of Babylon by the first king of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great, who must have been ruling in Susa by 540 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IrNElm3] By this time, the Elamite civilization had occupied the highlands of the south-western Iranian plateau and the fertile lowlands of the Susiana plain for over two millennia.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The traditional interpretation of this period has been that Elam effectively ceased to exist as an independent state after Ashurbanipal's invasion, becoming a province of Neo-Assyria until Assyria's own fortunes declined several decades later.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IrNElm3] However, some scholars believe that Ashurbanipal's destruction of Elam may not have been as complete as he claimed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IrNElm3] The archaeologist Pierre de Miroschedji has argued that by 625 BCE, Elam's government was restored and that the royal chancellery was active at Susa.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IrNElm3] The extent of Babylonian and Persian influence on Elamite politics in the century before c. 540 BCE is also a matter of ongoing debate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IrNElm3][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IrNElm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Secure population estimates for the area under Elamite control in this period are lacking.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IrNElm3&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ ♥</b> in squared kilometers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b> People.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Before the Islamic conquest, major concentration of settlement were always localized in the following three major regions: the central Zagros, the lowland steppe, and Marv Dasht.

The sanctuary is situated in a gorge in the eastern part of the valley of Izeh (Malamir). Most conspicuous are its six reliefs (KF I-VI), depicting various cultic acts and stages in a grand sacrificial feast, carved on the rock faces of the gorge and on three boulders. All are near the entrance to the gorge. One of the reliefs is accompanied by a long Neo-Elamite inscription (EKI 75) and ten short captions (EKI 75A-K). The subjects of the reliefs may be summarized as follows: "KF I (northern face): ruler with two court officials, one carrying (the ruler’s?) bow, quiver, and sword; musicians with harps and drum (?); officiants with a humped bovid and sacrificed rams at an altar; inscription and captions identifying the figures. "KF II (boulder): ruler in praying attitude; attendants and officiants sacrificing a humped bovid and six other animals. "KF III (boulder): ruler lifted on a platform (depicted twice); a host of participants in superimposed registers on both sides marching in procession toward the sacrifice; harp players; sacrificial animals (18 smaller animals, 3 humped bovids). "KF IV (southern face): banquet with seated ruler before table accompanied by attendants and court dignitaries (one carrying bow, quiver, and sword); six harp players and their conductor; numerous participants in registers (on panels left, below, and right of the central relief ) oriented toward the king and lifting their right hands to their mouths (paying homage to the king or eating?); six officiants (?) on the extreme left near the fire-altar or fire bowls (cf. below). "KF V (southern face): ruler in praying attitude followed by his retinue; thymiaterion; officiant slaughtering humped bovid; six more sacrificed animals. "KF VI (boulder): ruler in praying attitude, lifted on a platform, and followed by a short procession of his retinue (one dignitary carrying a quiver); another surface prepared but not used for an additional relief."[...] "There is no agreement among scholars on the date of Kul-e Farah. Some have dated all reliefs to various stages of the Neo-Elamite period, while in more recent studies most are dated to the Middle Elamite period. [...]"[...] "As in the case of sip, the feast of Aiapir may well have been celebrated annually, during the autumn season. This suspicion rests on the assumption that the region of eastern Khuzestan and western Fars is most suitable for agro-pastoralism and on the observation that tribes adapted to that way of life made up, until recently, most of the population in these parts. Within the grand system of migration routes and seasonal pastures in what is commonly known as the Bakhtiari Mountains, the Izeh valley functions as garmsir land and is used as winter residence by the Car Lang. The pastoralists descend to the area in September/October from their summer pastures in the eastern mountains (in the direction of Esfahan) and stay until April/May. Because the autumn rutting season falls in October and lambs from the summer season are born in Novem- ber (cf. Barth 1961: 7), autumn is the best time to reduce the herds by slaughtering or selling the surplus of yearling animals as well as infertile ewes. This has the additional advantage of lowering the need for fodder during the winter season. In the days of Hanni and his predecessors, conditions are likely to have been similar, even though there may have been a more important sedentary segment resident in the valley. It may therefore be expected that the feast of Kul-e Farah took place in autumn.[...] "The central role of the ruler is a prominent feature of both sip and the feast of Aiapir. The fact that the ruler of Aiapir is depicted on all six reliefs in Kul-e Farah and that sacrifices are always performed right in front of him indicate his role as the celebration’s protagonist.[...] "The centrality of the king also found visual expression during the sacrificial feast. At Aiapir, we find the ruler enthroned and surrounded by a multitude of banquet guests who have all turned their faces to him and pay him homage with their gestures (KF I). The king also leads the procession toward the sanctuary (KF III, VI). To accentuate his position even more, the ruler is raised on a platform and carried to the place where the sacrifice takes place. [...] "Not only the position of the ruler but that of every participant found explicit expression at the sacrificial feast. Visible hierarchy was a key element. As De Waele (1972: 2-3; 1989: 34) notes, the Kul-e Farah reliefs are a panorama of an intricate social pyramid in which status is expressed by size, arrangement, closeness to the king, representation in frontal view or in profile, garments, hair-cut, and beard. [...]"[...]"Like sip, the feast at Aiapir may have been a forum at which the king could pay off “debts” by awarding seats of honor to his servants in the local government. That Hanni chose to mention his principal ministers by name in the inscriptions on KF I and that these officials are positioned close to the ruler similarly imply recognition for services rendered. As for the base level of ordinary Aiapirans and workers in the Persepolis economy, the banquets meant access to rare meat rations for larger groups (§6.3.3): a true feast! "The unity of the ruler and his god would of course have been stressed to the maximum during sacrificial feasts such as sip and the one celebrated at Aiapir. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the gods associated with sip or earlier sup are closely connected to the ruler or the dynasty, including Insusinak, Sasum, and Auramazda (§7.1.6). No doubt, Hanni will have adopted a similar attitude vis-à-vis Tirutur. Yet, in the end, neither the king nor the god is the principle participant in the sacrificial feast. That which is celebrated is the community that convenes and reconstitutes itself. Group identity, social hierarchy, and bonds of loyalty are reconfirmed in the sacrifice and the ensuing banquet. This is of special importance in a situation whereby ruler and subjects are separated from each other during large parts of the year. Sedentary and pastoralist Aiapirans, the latter returning from their summer abode, were reunited amid the reliefs of Kul-e Farah, those sublime expressions of their common identity. [...] Traditional hymns played an important role in Persian religious experience (references in Briant 2002: 245, 330), as did music, and, probably, song in Kul-e Farah. Such a musical setting may have served to connect the present to the past and to lift the momentary experience of the feast to a timeless level. At Aiapir, this connection with the past is made tangible in such a way that visiting the site is still a haunting experience. Not only the king and priests, but all members of the community found themselves mirrored on the surrounding reliefs when they entered the gorge for the annual feast. The engraving on the stone of the very ceremony that they were about to perform visualized their bond with a communal past and a communal future by putting the whole gathering sub specie aeternitatis."

The text includes a series of provisions for regular (monthly) sacrifices of sheep, flour and beer referred to as terru šetru, as well as provisions for several feasts and other occasional offerings (including those before the saparru-wagon of king Tepti-ahar). The amounts for the regular offerings are allocated per two months and divided over six persons, the massarû É.DÙ.A, "Guardians of the (funerary) House,' who 'give' (offer) the sacrificial goods, presumably from a grant founded for this purpose (so Reiner 1973a: 93-4). The institution of regular sacrifices, the possible provision of capital by the crown (in the form of a land grant or serjeanty), and the appointment of six named individuals as executives, altogether translates into a regular income for the 'guardians' taken from the foodstuffs allocated for the sacrifices. As such, Stone Stela 1 provides a parallel for the regular monthly and daily offerings and their human beneficiaries in Persepolis. What comes to mind is lan, but perhaps even more the offerings characterised by the terms šumar and bašur. These offerings involve, like Haft Tepe offerings, <i>groups</i> of executives and relatively high amounts of foodstuffs--the 'guardians' in Stone Stela 1 were probably not the only persons living off the livestock, flour and beer."

The sanctuary is situated in a gorge in the eastern part of the valley of Izeh (Malamir). Most conspicuous are its six reliefs (KF I-VI), depicting various cultic acts and stages in a grand sacrificial feast, carved on the rock faces of the gorge and on three boulders. All are near the entrance to the gorge. One of the reliefs is accompanied by a long Neo-Elamite inscription (EKI 75) and ten short captions (EKI 75A-K). The subjects of the reliefs may be summarized as follows: "KF I (northern face): ruler with two court officials, one carrying (the ruler’s?) bow, quiver, and sword; musicians with harps and drum (?); officiants with a humped bovid and sacrificed rams at an altar; inscription and captions identifying the figures. "KF II (boulder): ruler in praying attitude; attendants and officiants sacrificing a humped bovid and six other animals. "KF III (boulder): ruler lifted on a platform (depicted twice); a host of participants in superimposed registers on both sides marching in procession toward the sacrifice; harp players; sacrificial animals (18 smaller animals, 3 humped bovids). "KF IV (southern face): banquet with seated ruler before table accompanied by attendants and court dignitaries (one carrying bow, quiver, and sword); six harp players and their conductor; numerous participants in registers (on panels left, below, and right of the central relief ) oriented toward the king and lifting their right hands to their mouths (paying homage to the king or eating?); six officiants (?) on the extreme left near the fire-altar or fire bowls (cf. below). "KF V (southern face): ruler in praying attitude followed by his retinue; thymiaterion; officiant slaughtering humped bovid; six more sacrificed animals. "KF VI (boulder): ruler in praying attitude, lifted on a platform, and followed by a short procession of his retinue (one dignitary carrying a quiver); another surface prepared but not used for an additional relief."[...] "There is no agreement among scholars on the date of Kul-e Farah. Some have dated all reliefs to various stages of the Neo-Elamite period, while in more recent studies most are dated to the Middle Elamite period. [...]"[...] "As in the case of sip, the feast of Aiapir may well have been celebrated annually, during the autumn season. This suspicion rests on the assumption that the region of eastern Khuzestan and western Fars is most suitable for agro-pastoralism and on the observation that tribes adapted to that way of life made up, until recently, most of the population in these parts. Within the grand system of migration routes and seasonal pastures in what is commonly known as the Bakhtiari Mountains, the Izeh valley functions as garmsir land and is used as winter residence by the Car Lang. The pastoralists descend to the area in September/October from their summer pastures in the eastern mountains (in the direction of Esfahan) and stay until April/May. Because the autumn rutting season falls in October and lambs from the summer season are born in Novem- ber (cf. Barth 1961: 7), autumn is the best time to reduce the herds by slaughtering or selling the surplus of yearling animals as well as infertile ewes. This has the additional advantage of lowering the need for fodder during the winter season. In the days of Hanni and his predecessors, conditions are likely to have been similar, even though there may have been a more important sedentary segment resident in the valley. It may therefore be expected that the feast of Kul-e Farah took place in autumn.[...] "The central role of the ruler is a prominent feature of both sip and the feast of Aiapir. The fact that the ruler of Aiapir is depicted on all six reliefs in Kul-e Farah and that sacrifices are always performed right in front of him indicate his role as the celebration’s protagonist.[...] "The centrality of the king also found visual expression during the sacrificial feast. At Aiapir, we find the ruler enthroned and surrounded by a multitude of banquet guests who have all turned their faces to him and pay him homage with their gestures (KF I). The king also leads the procession toward the sanctuary (KF III, VI). To accentuate his position even more, the ruler is raised on a platform and carried to the place where the sacrifice takes place. [...] "Not only the position of the ruler but that of every participant found explicit expression at the sacrificial feast. Visible hierarchy was a key element. As De Waele (1972: 2-3; 1989: 34) notes, the Kul-e Farah reliefs are a panorama of an intricate social pyramid in which status is expressed by size, arrangement, closeness to the king, representation in frontal view or in profile, garments, hair-cut, and beard. [...]"[...]"Like sip, the feast at Aiapir may have been a forum at which the king could pay off “debts” by awarding seats of honor to his servants in the local government. That Hanni chose to mention his principal ministers by name in the inscriptions on KF I and that these officials are positioned close to the ruler similarly imply recognition for services rendered. As for the base level of ordinary Aiapirans and workers in the Persepolis economy, the banquets meant access to rare meat rations for larger groups (§6.3.3): a true feast! "The unity of the ruler and his god would of course have been stressed to the maximum during sacrificial feasts such as sip and the one celebrated at Aiapir. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the gods associated with sip or earlier sup are closely connected to the ruler or the dynasty, including Insusinak, Sasum, and Auramazda (§7.1.6). No doubt, Hanni will have adopted a similar attitude vis-à-vis Tirutur. Yet, in the end, neither the king nor the god is the principle participant in the sacrificial feast. That which is celebrated is the community that convenes and reconstitutes itself. Group identity, social hierarchy, and bonds of loyalty are reconfirmed in the sacrifice and the ensuing banquet. This is of special importance in a situation whereby ruler and subjects are separated from each other during large parts of the year. Sedentary and pastoralist Aiapirans, the latter returning from their summer abode, were reunited amid the reliefs of Kul-e Farah, those sublime expressions of their common identity. [...] Traditional hymns played an important role in Persian religious experience (references in Briant 2002: 245, 330), as did music, and, probably, song in Kul-e Farah. Such a musical setting may have served to connect the present to the past and to lift the momentary experience of the feast to a timeless level. At Aiapir, this connection with the past is made tangible in such a way that visiting the site is still a haunting experience. Not only the king and priests, but all members of the community found themselves mirrored on the surrounding reliefs when they entered the gorge for the annual feast. The engraving on the stone of the very ceremony that they were about to perform visualized their bond with a communal past and a communal future by putting the whole gathering sub specie aeternitatis."

'The series of kings whose reigns can now be dated to the post-Assyrian period ... may very well have started directly after Huban-haltašh III. Plausibly, they quickly regained a certain political stability and military power. This would explain a reference in a Babylonian chronicle ... to the return of cult statues from Uruk, where they had been taken by the Assyrians, to Susa in the accession year of Nabopolassar [626 BCE].[MAJIDBENAM_REF_287_IrNElm3] Evidently, the Neo-Babylonian king was seeking support for his insurrection against Assyria. His gesture does seem to imply that 1) a certain authority was present in Susa and able to receive the statues by 625 BC ... and 2) that this authority could command sufficient troops to be of interest to Nabopolassar'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_288_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ ♥</b> <b>♠ Right to petition executive ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Critique of executive by government ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Critique of executive by non-government ♣ ♥</b> <b>♠ Sanction of executive by government ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sanction of executive by non-government ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by government ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Henkelman refers to a government body called the 'Elders of Elam', for which we have evidence from the Middle and Neo-Elamite periods. During Ashurbanipal's campaigns against Elam from 653 to 645 BCE, the elders 'stepped in to avert further Assyrian aggression. At first sight this seems a sign of serious political disintegration: apparently the Elamite king did not have the authority to solve the Nabû-bēl-šumāti matter [this Chaldean rebel had taken refuge in Elam and the Neo-Assyrian Empire was demanding his extradition], and in response to this an ad hoc body of "elders" emerged. While it cannot be denied that the severe Assyrian pressure led to the emergence of several competing factions at this time in Elam, it is also true that it was the Elamite king who eventually solved the matter by sending Nabû-bēl-šumāti's corpse to Assyria. More important, the Elders of Elam were not a novel body and thus indicative of a dissolution of traditional monarchical rule. The elders were in fact part of the traditional make-up of the Elamite state as shown by a Middle Elamite inscription of Šilhak-Inšušinak I that mentions the "Elders of Elam" ... as first part of a triad that clearly describes the kingdom's elite ... This or a similar body apparently still existed at the time of the Assyrian raids, acted as a representative organ, and was recognised as such by Assurbanipal in BM 132980'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_289_IrNElm3] This discussion tells us that the Elders of Elam constituted a long-standing government institution that exercised considerable power and could act independently of the king. Discussing the early Neo-Elamite II period, Carter and Stolper also say that 'Some suggestion of the diffusion of political power appears in other Elamite texts of the time, exceptional for their portrayal of nonroyal figures'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_290_IrNElm3] The image we receive from Elamite and Mesopotamian sources is not one of unconstrained executive power exercised by the monarch alone, and I have not come across any suggestion that the situation was different in the post-Assyrian period (NE III).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by non-government ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Impeachment ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Based on what we know from Mesopotamian sources, Neo-Elamite kings were frequently removed from power through violent coups, but there is no mention of any legal mechanism for impeaching the chief executive.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Informal critique of executive ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal sanction of executive ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal constraint on executive ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal impeachment ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Based on what we know from Mesopotamian sources, unpopular Neo-Elamite kings were simply killed by their subjects or their usurping relatives - I have found no reference to a monarch being persuaded to step down peacefully.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Critique of executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sanction of executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Impeachment by religious agents ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Based on what we know from Mesopotamian sources, unpopular Neo-Elamite kings were simply killed by their subjects or their usurping relatives - I have found no reference to a monarch being persuaded to step down peacefully.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Subordination of the chief executive to a religious agent ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Motivation by belief in supernatural agent ♣ present ♥</b> The long Elamite tradition of kings building temples and other religious structures, leaving behind dedicatory inscriptions, continued into this period: 'Kings still showed their piety by building and restoring temples'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_291_IrNElm3] For instance, in a short inscription issued by Tepti-Humban-Inshushinak (now considered to postdate the Assyrian sack of Susa in 647 BCE)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_292_IrNElm3] 'The Neo-Elamite monarch claims to have 'destroyed the land(s) of the <i>balahuteppe</i> and the land(s) of the <i>lallarippe</i>, to have received their tribute and to have built a temple for the goddess Pinigir'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_293_IrNElm3][MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Henkelman thinks that 'the Neo-Elamite state' as a whole does not belong with those 'monarchies in which legitimacy is strictly defined by an uncontroversial principle, such as primogeniture'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_294_IrNElm3] Usurpation was common; he stresses that this should not be 'equated with <i>institutional</i> instability', but nevertheless it shows that there was no widely agreed upon legal or even customary mechanism for the transfer of royal power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_295_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Legal mechanism ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Henkelman thinks that 'the Neo-Elamite state' as a whole does not belong with those 'monarchies in which legitimacy is strictly defined by an uncontroversial principle, such as primogeniture'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_296_IrNElm3] Usurpation was common; he stresses that this should not be 'equated with <i>institutional</i> instability', but nevertheless it shows that there was no widely agreed upon legal or even customary mechanism for the transfer of royal power.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_297_IrNElm3]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Number of power transitions ♣ unknown ♥</b> The evidence for Elamite rulers in this period is very scanty indeed.

After his victory at Susa Assurbanipal carried off the statues of nineteen deities, which he listed by name; all had apparently Susan Elamite names. Despite the misleading spellings, the names of several deities are recognizable, including those with the most prestige: Insusinak, Simut, Lagamal, Pinigir, Hutran, and Kirmasir (Aynard, pp. 54-55). “In the Neo-Elamite period, although the principal divinities in the pantheon (Insusinak, Napirisa, Lagamal, Pinigir, Nahhunte, etc.) continued to be honored, lesser known or previously unknown gods came to the fore, among them Masti and Tepti at Malamir, sasum at Kesat, and sati and Lali (among many others) at Susa. The most popular god was Hu(m)ban, who had been mentioned second in the list of gods in the treaty of Naram-Sin. In this period his name appeared as an element in half the royal names and in many other names as well (Scheil, 1907). He did not, however, have a temple at Susa. All these gods were thus essentially Elamite; even the Mesopotamian name of the goddess DIL.BAT, to whom silhak-Insusinak dedicated a temple, could actually have been an epithet for the goddess Masti. [...] The essential role of the gods was to give life, to preserve it as long as possible, and finally to take it back, accompanying the dead to the other world. These different aspects of the divine prerogative can be illustrated by many examples. For example, several cylinder seals found at Coga Zanbil are inscribed “It is for the god (to give) life; it is for the king to save it” (Reiner, 1970b, p. 134). Humban-numena declared that “from the bosom of his mother Napirisa and Insusinak created his name” (Steve, 1987, no. 3). Throughout Elamite history royal dedications show that the kings built temples to protect their own lives and sometimes those of the entire royal family. The simplest formula in such texts is “I, so-and-so, have built such-and-such a sanctuary and, for my life, I have offered it to such-and-such a god.” But more specific requests were addressed to different divinities for a long and favorable and happy reign, for long life, and for a prosperous lineage (Grillot, 1982). “Nevertheless, death seems to have been the principal preoccupation of the Elamites. Most religious buildings were connected with the cult of the dead, and the principal gods were closely associated with the passage of the dead into the next world. [...] Although many gods were associated with the cult of the dead, three played a particularly important role: Insusinak, the weigher of souls, and his two assistants, Isnikarab and Lagamal. A few small funerary tablets (Bottero, pp. 393-401), though very badly preserved, give some idea of the passage into the other world: The dead person, preceded by Isnikarab or Lagamal or both presents himself in the hastu (in the Akkadian texts suttu, a synonym for hastu) before Insusinak, who decides his fate. This scene seems to be illustrated on a number of cylinder seals, where it is commonly identified as a “presentation scene,” even though it is more probably a depiction of the last judgment (Vallat, 1989). [...] Another prerogative of the gods was to confer and protect kingship. Puzur-Insusinak spoke of “the year when Insusinak looked at him (and) gave to him the four regions” (Scheil, 1908, p. 9). It was also Insusinak who conferred kingship upon Humban-numena and the latter’s son Untas-Napirisa (König, nos. 4, no. 13), but it was Manzat who conferred it on Igi-halki (Steve, 1987, no. 2). “In the Elamite pantheon goddesses played a more important role than elsewhere. The enumeration of forty deities in the treaty of Naram-Sin begins with Pinigir, goddess of love and procreation, who was worshiped throughout Elamite history and had an astam, or temple of fertility; she was very frequently represented in art (Spycket, 1992). In addition, various local divinities were goddesses: Kiririsa at Liyan, Upurkupak at Coga Pahn (KS-102) and Gotwand, Masti at Malamir, Manzat at Deh-e Now (q.v.). “The Elamite pantheon was formed from the combination of the pantheons of the principal geopolitical entities that constituted Elam; it is not therefore astonishing that different gods played the same role or possessed the same attributes. Several gods and goddesses had the epithet “great god,” which it is probably correct to understand as “the supreme god”: Insusinak, Napirisa, Humban, Nahhunte, Kiririsa, Manzat, and so on. In addition, several deities were protectors of the gods (Masti, Napir), of kings (Insusinak, Kiririsa, Napir), or of Elam (Silir-katru). Kiririsa and Masti were “mothers of the gods.” Several deities were particularly linked to death by the epithet lahakra (of death): Insusinak, Kiririsa, Upurkupak, and perhaps Ruhuratir and Tepti.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_413_IrNElm3] In addition to this, according to Henkelman, there was very strong continuity between Elam and Achaemenid Persia, including in terms of ideology: “the Elamite state, both before and after the Assyrian wars, must have been a real Fundgrube for the emergent Persian society and culture in terms of literacy, art, craftsmanship, bureaucracy, royal ideology, military organization, trade networks, administrative mechanisms, and political structure. Persia may indeed be seen as “the heir of Elam” (not of “Media”), to quote Mario Liverani’s provocative comment on the matter (2003: 10; cf. Henkelman 2008a: 4; forthcoming a; forthcoming b).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_414_IrNElm3] Therefore, some aspects of Elamite ideology may be inferred on the basis of what is known about (Achaemenid) Persian ideology. Elements of Achaemenid ideology that clearly derive from Zoroastrianism have been excluded.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IrNElm3&amp;action=edit&amp;section=66" title="Edit section: Deification of Rulers">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> “Another prerogative of the gods was to confer and protect kingship.
