This established the Achaemenid - of the first Persian - Empire, in which the Medes shared the status of ruling people with the Persians, so much so indeed that the Greeks frequently called the Persians 'Medes' and coined the term 'Medizing' to denote 'pro-Persian policy' or 'Persian partisan'."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state; confederate state ♥</b>Loose federation with irregular taxation under Cyrus and Cambyses with automomous satrapies.

Before Darius trade was in barter or Lydian gold coins. Satraps could coin money but only King of Kings could coin in gold.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IrAchae] Darius I developed a national script (Old Persian cuneiform)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IrAchae] but seems to have been ceremonial and used by Persians, in satraps local languages used.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Prior to the Parthians, political systems in Southwest Asia were for the most part relatively loose confederations in which central government ruled their 'empires' through unstable alliances with vassals and satraps.

From 553 to 550 BCE, Cyrus led his fellow Persians against Median hegemony (even though the Medes were ruled by his own relatives), establishing the Persians as the dominant group in Iran. His kingdom became known as the Achaemenid Empire after the legendary first King of Persia, Achaemenes, claimed to be an ancestor of the Great Cyrus himself (Achaemenid essentially translates to 'children of Achaemenes').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Capitalizing on these early victories, Cyrus II the Great continued his military domination, conquering the wealthy Lydian Kingdom in modern-day Turkey along with most of Asia Minor and the Neo-Babylonian Kingdom in Mesopotamia, as well as consolidating Persia's hold over much of central Asia as far as modern Pakistan. His son and heir, Cambyses II, continued this tradition, expanding Achaemenid rule into the large and wealthy kingdom of Egypt. After Cambyses II's death in 522 BCE, a noble Persian named Darius came to power after overthrowing an alleged usurper to the throne (Gautama, supposedly posing as Cyrus II's son Bardiya, more commonly known by his Greek name Smerdis).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IrAchae] Darius I, who also took the title of 'the Great', was a powerful ruler who inaugurated several military, administrative, and economic reforms,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IrAchae] though is most well known for leading the Persian army to defeat at the hands of a coalition of small Greek city-states during the famous Persian Wars of the early 5th century BCE. Despite the fact that Darius' son and heir Xerxes I (the Great) also failed to conquer the Greek Aegean and lost a decisive battle to the same outnumbered coalition of Greeks, the Achaemenid Empire remained intact.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In 330 BCE, Darius III became the twelfth and final emperor in the Achaemenid line when he succumbed to the conquests of Alexander the Great and his invading Macedonian army (twelfth not including the alleged usurper Bardiya/Smerdis nor the short-lived Artaxerxes V, who declared himself emperor for a brief moment after Darius III was killed as Alexander was completing his conquest).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IrAchae] Alexander became the ruler of all the territory formerly held by the Persians, incorporating it into the massive, though short-lived, Macedonian Empire and bringing an end to the great Persian Achaemenid Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Achaemenid Empire was one of the largest empires in the pre-modern world, stretching nearly 6 million square kilometres across the Near East, Central Asia, the Indus Valley, Middle East, and into Egypt at its greatest extent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IrAchae] It was a massive, multi-ethnic society made up of Medes, Persians, Lydians, Greeks, Egyptians, Babylonians, Bactrians, Sogdians, and numerous other cultural-ethnic groups; indeed, Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian, Aramaic, hieroglyphic Egyptian, and Greek were all used in royal and provincial communication.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IrAchae] Between the Great rulers Cyrus II, Cambyses II, and Darius I, the Persians had stitched together an empire out of the centres of the oldest civilizations from Anatolia to Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Indus valley. Persepolis and the grand Pasargadae were large ceremonial and ritual centres in the heartland of Persia, while Susa in western Iran was the major administrative capital. At its peak under Darius I, the empire covered a huge swathe of diverse territory from the eastern Mediterranean all the way to the Indus Valley, incorporating navigable seas and rivers, protected ports and fertile agricultural land as well as rough mountainous passes. This territory held a population of between 17 and 35 million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Persian Empire ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Persian_500BCE: 550BCE-401BCE; Persian_400BCE: 400BCE-331BCE ♥</b>  Persian_400BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_IrAchae] Persian_500BCE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  5626366: 550BCE-401BCE;  4557320: 400BCE-331BCE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Indo-European ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Indo-Iranian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Old Persian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Zoroastrianism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Judaism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Ancient Mesopotamian Religion ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b> <i>These codes were developed at Seshat General Workshop in Oxford 2017</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IrAchae&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [2,500,000-4,100,000]: 539-501 BCE; [4,800,000-5,500,000]: 500-451 BCE; [3,800,000-4,325,000]: 450-331 BCE ♥</b> Square kilometers. 2,500,000: 550 BCE; 4,100,000: 525 BCE; 5,500,000: 500 BCE; 4,800,000: 450 BCE; 3,800,000: 400 BCE; 4,325,000: 350 BCE [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Egypt independent from empire between 403 - 343 BCE.

Their oldest historical traditions are the heroic material found in the Avestan Yašts (Christensen, 1917, 1928, 1931; Boyce, Zoroastrianism I, pp. 92-108; Yarshater, pp. 411-53), in which "historical facts and accurate genealogies" are interwoven with "poetic fiction and fable." In these traditions "are seemingly preserved both secular and priestly traditions, transmitted by minstrel poets as well as by religious schools; and there are elements also of popular superstition and dread, in the tales of demons and witches and fearsome beasts. These intermingle with the stories of valour which show also the power of the gods to grant to men's prayers and succor them in distress" (Boyce, Zoroastrianism I, p. 108). With the conquest of the ancient Near East, the Iranians became familiar with cultures that had long established traditions of written history (Klima, pp. 214-17; Grayson, 1975a, pp. 1-7; G. Cameron, pp. 79-81). This led to a number of developments. Firstly, the Iranians began keeping records of historical events, of which Cyrus's Chronicle from Babylonia (see CYRUS CYLINDER) and Darius's Bisotun inscriptions (q.v.) and their Aramaic versions, which were dispatched to the empire's provinces, are the best examples. They meant to convincethe reader that "Persians were divinely appointed saviors whose mission was to bring justice, order, and tranquillity to the people of the world" (G. Cameron, pp. 81-94, esp. p. 93).

The only example of orderly, consensual succession seems to be that which followed the death of Cyrus the Great, after which his chosen heir and eldest son Cambyses took the throne.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_289_IrAchae] Below is a list of contested power transitions and a brief historical account for each. <span style="color:purple">1. Cyrus II, 'the Great' (r. 560/59-530 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_290_IrAchae] Astyages was the last Median king, overthrown by Cyrus II around 550 bce.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_291_IrAchae] There is 'conflicting information' about Astyages, his family and the rise of Cyrus. Frye believes that common motifs from Indo-European myth have been integrated into the 'Cyrus saga' related in the Greek and Roman sources, making it hard to sift fact from fantasy,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_292_IrAchae] and Cizek notes that tales of Cyrus's birth fall into the '"divine" bastard' category of myths.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_293_IrAchae]. He was probably Astyages's grandson, son of Cambyses I and Astyages's daughter Mandane,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_294_IrAchae] but stories of his concealment and secret childhood with a 'herdsman and his wife in the north of Media' are 'not to be believed'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_295_IrAchae] From Akkadian sources we can be reasonably sure that 'Cyrus defeated Astyages in battle, and the Median army revolted against Astyages delivering him to Cyrus who plundered Ecbatana and took Astyages as a prisoner to Persis'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_296_IrAchae] The Achaemenid Empire was thus founded through a violent revolt. (NB: Cyrus became king of the Persian tribes around 560 bce, ten years before rising up to dethrone Astyages).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_297_IrAchae] <span style="color:purple">2. Bardiya or 'false Bardiya' (Gaumata) (r. 522 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_298_IrAchae] Cambyses II had become king in an orderly succession after the death of his father Cyrus the Great. However, the jostling for the throne that followed Cambyses' death and eventually resulted in the accession of Darius I is 'one of the most debated episodes of early Achaemenid history ... During this brief period, the Achaemenid throne was held/seized by one or several individual(s), about whose identity our sources provide conflicting information.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_299_IrAchae] Shayegan outlines two competing hypotheses: 'false-Bardiya' and 'true-Bardiya'. Adherents of the former, who accept the truth of Darius' statements on the Bisitun (or 'Behistun') inscription as well as the (slightly different) account of Herodotus, believe that before Cambyses II left to fight in Egypt, he secretly had his full brother Bardiya (also known as Smerdis) murdered. The man who later seized power, calling himself Bardiya, was an impostor: a Magian called Gaumata, in fact the brother of Patizeithes, the Magian whom Cambyses had left in charge of the throne.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_300_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_REF_301_IrAchae] However, other scholars consider the Bisitun inscription to be a 'propagandistic narrative destined to cover Darius' own coup d'etat against the legitimate Bardiya, for the concealment of whose rule the presumed fiction of a usurper-magus was invented'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_302_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_REF_303_IrAchae] Briant states that the true-Bardiya hypothesis, entailing propagandistic deception by Darius, is 'these days generally accepted'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_304_IrAchae], and this is certainly the line taken by Bruce Lincoln in a 2007 book.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_305_IrAchae] Equally unclear is the mechanism by which power was transferred from Cambyses to Bardiya/Gaumata. One possibility is that this was not a 'real usurpation' but an example of orderly succession after Cambyses' death in Egypt - Cambyses left no sons, and Bardiya would have been the 'sole male descendant of the royal family'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_306_IrAchae] Alternatively, (true) Bardiya may have taken advantage of Cambyses' absence to usurp his brother's throne, or (false) Bardiya/Gaumata, the impostor Magian, may have usurped the throne, as Darius claims. <span style="color:purple">3. Darius I, 'the Great' (r. 522-486 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_307_IrAchae] Before he came to the throne, the man who became Darius the Great served Cambyses II as 'spear-bearer' in Egypt.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_308_IrAchae] According to the Histories of Herodotus and Darius' own account in the Bisotun inscription, Darius killed the 'impostor' Magian Gaumata, who had seized the throne in Cambyses' absence, claiming to be Cambyses' brother Bardiya.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_309_IrAchae] (See no. 3, above). Darius was aided by six Persian nobles[MAJIDBENAM_REF_310_IrAchae] and may even have played a relatively minor role in the planning of the coup.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_311_IrAchae] After Bardiya/Gaumata was dead, 'the Seven' entered discussions about the rulership of the empire (according to Herodotus, who also says that one man, Otanes, favoured 'the rule of the multitude') and Darius was eventually accepted as the rightful king on the condition that he preserve special rights for his co-conspirators.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_312_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_REF_313_IrAchae] He then began to shore up his legitimacy: he used the Bisotun inscription to assert his hereditary right to the throne, presenting himself as the descendant of an ancient kingly line: 'For this reason, we are called Achaemenians. From long ago we have been noble. From long ago our family (tauma) had been kings'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_314_IrAchae] Despite this, his 'seizure of the throne was immediately followed by risings in Mesopotamia, Armenia, and the Iranian lands ... There does not seem to have been popular support for Darius'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_315_IrAchae] In no sense could we call this transition of power 'orderly'. <span style="color:purple">4. Xerxes I (r. 486-465 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_316_IrAchae] Xerxes was the son of Darius the Great, but even his accession was not simple.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_317_IrAchae] Herodotus gives a detailed account of a 'great quarrel' between Darius' sons, which is partly corroborated by Xerxes' own XPf ('Harem') inscription.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_318_IrAchae] According to Herodotus, 'while Darius was making preparations against Egypt and Athens, a great quarrel arose among his sons concerning the chief power in the land. They held that before his army marched he must declare an heir to the kingship according to Persian law. Three sons had been born to Darius before he became king by his first wife, the daughter of Gobryas, and four more after he became king by Atossa daughter of Cyrus. Artobazanes was the oldest of the earlier sons, Xerxes of the later; and as sons of different mothers they were rivals. Artobazanes pleaded that he was the oldest of all Darius' offspring and that it was everywhere customary that the eldest should rule; Xerxes argued that he was the son of Cyrus' daughter Atossa and that it was Cyrus who had won the Persians their freedom.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_319_IrAchae] Darius eventually decided in favour of Xerxes, publicly proclaiming him as the heir to the crown.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_320_IrAchae] <span style="color:purple">5. Artaxerxes I (r. 465-424 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_321_IrAchae] Xerxes I was assassinated by court officials in a plot masterminded by Artabanus, his chief bodyguard who 'aspired to the kingship' according to Justin and Diodorus.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_322_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_REF_323_IrAchae] The Greek and Roman sources generally agree that Artabanus then convinced Artaxerxes, the dead king's youngest son, that his elder brother Darius was the murderer. Artaxerxes kills Darius and becomes king, but then discovers Artabanus' deception and has him killed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_324_IrAchae] The degree to which this transition of power was contested is unclear: 'According to Diodorus and Justin, Artaxerxes then reigns without further ado. According to Ctesias, a quarrel arises between the accomplices - Artabanus's sons on the one hand, the other Persians on the other ... Bactria revolts, led by a different Artabanus; Artaxerxes wins and subdues Bactria'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_325_IrAchae] There was another son called Hystaspes, the second eldest, but he was satrap in Bactra at the time of his father's assassination.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_326_IrAchae] Briant thinks that Hystaspes may have been the 'other' Artabanus mentioned by Ctesias, so the Bactrian rebellion could be seen as the response of an older brother who considered himself the rightful heir to the throne.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_327_IrAchae] <span style="color:purple">6. Xerxes II (r. 424/3 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_328_IrAchae] Artaxerxes died in late 424 or early 423 bce, leaving his only legitimate son to take 'the throne under the name Xerxes (II)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_329_IrAchae] 'It is likely that Xerxes took the throne because of his parentage and perhaps also because his father had recognized him as crown prince.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_330_IrAchae] However, I have counted this transition as contested because Xerxes was assassinated after a reign of less than two months and was not subsequently recognized as a legitimate king in the Babylonian records (see numbers 7 and 8). <span style="color:purple">7. Sogdianus (r. 424/3 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_331_IrAchae] Although Xerxes II was the only legitimate son of Artaxerxes I, he also had a number of illegitimate sons, of which 'three were of consequence'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_332_IrAchae] One of these, Sogdianus, assassinated Xerxes while he was drunk, after a reign of just 45 days, and seized the throne.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_333_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_REF_334_IrAchae] <span style="color:purple">8. Darius II (r. 423-404 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_335_IrAchae] Another illegitimate son of Artaxerxes I, Ochus, challenged Sogdianus' accession and soon managed to wrest the throne from him in 423 bce.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_336_IrAchae] He took the throne name Darius II.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_337_IrAchae] It should be noted that the Babylonian scribes recognized the reigns of neither Xerxes II or Sogdianus, and that Sogdianus and Ochus/Darius II probably 'announced their pretensions simultaneously', winning over different nobles to their respective sides.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_338_IrAchae] In light of this, it seems that Sogdianus would have had a very brief and contested reign. <span style="color:purple">9. Artaxerxes II (r. 404-359 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_339_IrAchae] Darius II 'had several sons from his marriage to Parysatis', and at least four of them survived past childhood.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_340_IrAchae] He seems to have chosen Arses as his heir, who acceded to the throne after his father's death in 404 bce and took the throne name Artaxerxes (II).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_341_IrAchae] However, he was challenged by his younger brother, Cyrus (the Younger), who marched against him using Greek mercenaries but was defeated in battle.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_342_IrAchae] Briant dubs this the 'war of the two brothers'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_343_IrAchae] <span style="color:purple">10. Artaxerxes III (r. 359-338 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_344_IrAchae] According to an assortment of classical authors (Justin, Plutarch, Aelian), Artaxerxes II had three legitimate sons 'from his marriage to Stateira: Darius (the oldest), Ariaspes ...  and Ochus (the youngest ...)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_345_IrAchae] He chose Darius as his heir, but Darius plotted to kill him and was sentenced to death; Ochus then drove his brother Ariaspes to suicide.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_346_IrAchae] When Artaxerxes II died of old age, Ochus took the throne under the name Artaxerxes III.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_347_IrAchae] <span style="color:purple">11. Artaxerxes IV (r. 338-336 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_348_IrAchae] According to several classical authors, at this point the kingship came under the influence of the powerful eunuch Bagoas, who became chiliarch in 343.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_349_IrAchae] Bagoas 'assassinated Artaxerxes III and his brothers' and installed Arses, Artaxerxes' son, on the throne.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_350_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_REF_351_IrAchae] Arses took the throne name Artaxerxes (IV). Briant is sceptical of classical accounts of the scheming eunuch Bagoas, noting that this was a common trope in Greek depictions of the Persians, but accepts that Artaxerxes III was assassinated.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_352_IrAchae] Although the kingship passed from father to son, this clearly cannot be seen as an orderly transition of power. <span style="color:purple">12. Darius III (r. 336-330 bce).</span>[MAJIDBENAM_REF_353_IrAchae] To follow the classical narrative, after installing Artaxerxes IV (Arses) on the throne, Bagoas the eunuch then also poisoned him and his children 'and chose Codoman/Artasata to be king (Darius III)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_354_IrAchae] Darius III was a second cousin and 'not a direct descendant' of Artaxerxes IV.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_355_IrAchae] We do have some corroboration for this account: 'The murder of Arses after two years of rule is also men­tioned (without citing his name) in a well-known Babylonian text, the Dynastic Proph­ecy, which states that the murder was committed by a sa resi (obviously Bagoas), after which a prince seized power and ruled for five years (Darius III)'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_356_IrAchae] Darius then had to contend with the invading Alexander of Macedon and disloyal Persian aristocrats. In 330 bce, Darius III was 'murdered by two Persian nobles (Bessos and Nabarzanes), one of whom proclaim[ed] himself king of Persia in eastern Iran and Bactria'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_357_IrAchae] However, through a combination of diplomacy - for instance, fashioning himself as Darius III's 'avenger and heir' and adopting Achaemenid royal customs - and military 'brutality', Alexander of Macedon was able to achieve recognition as the new ruler of the Persian Empire.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_358_IrAchae] Some scholars consider him to be the 'last of the Achaemenids'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_359_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Intra-elite conflicts ♣ present ♥</b> Artaxerxes III "poisoned by his own physician at the instigation of the court eunuch Bagoas".

The cumulative value of these allocations is among the highest for religious purposes recorded in the Fortification archive (S5). In fact, the sip texts explicitly state that large amounts were consumed, presumably by substantial groups of people; in one case, the human beneficiaries are identified as royal muleteers (S6.3.3). The occurrence of a kurdabattis, 'chief of workers', in several texts confirms that groups of laborers, possibly consisting of up to 520 individuals, may have attended the feast. Apart from its social and ideological functions, sip also had an economic side to it (cf. S4 on lan), namely, the distribution of meat rations to laborers. "Dated texts on sip indicate that the feast was celebrated in November/December, that there was no fixed date, and that sip could be celebrated more than once during the same season. Practical reasons for such an autumnal feast involving a high amount of animal sacrifices may have been the reduction of (internal) herds owing to the scarcity of fodder during the winter season, the occurrence of the autumnal rutting season in October, and the occurrence of the first lambing season in November (S6.3.4). The official reason, on the other hand, may have been the presence of the king in Fars during the Fall season, as is suggested (however elusively) by Greek and Elamite sources. His presence at the time of at least some sip celebrations may be assumed (S6.4.1). "The royal connection is expressed not only by the timing of sip but also through the pronounced involvement of Parnakka and Zissawis in its performance and organization (paralleled only in the sumar and basur offerings, which are also directly connected to the crown [S6.2]). Since Xerxes himself claims to have performed sip (XPh), it seems reasonable to suggest that Parnakka and Zissawis acted as the king’s representatives when they presided over the feast (S6.4.2). In addition, sip is mostly celebrated at places with a marked royal character: Appistapdan, Tikranus (large plantations; royal banquets), and Pasargadae (plantation; palaces of Cyrus; coronation ceremony). Finally, an analysis of Fortification texts on poultry, cattle, and sheep/ goats suggests that animals issued for sacrificial purposes always had a specific royal "earmark" that would be understood by the people consuming these gifts from the king. Such royal food tagging is confirmed by the Greek sources (S6.4.2). "As Herodotus reports, the Persian king organized a feast called tukta, which seems to have served as a forum for the acquittal of "debts," i.e., the rewarding of services rendered to the king (S6.4.3). Though perhaps not the same feast, sip may have had similar characteristics; the participation of royal muleteers, possibly responsible for the movements of the court, in a sip ceremony would suggest so. The feast could therefore be seen as an element in a refined system of royal gift-giving in Fars as attested in Elamite and Greek sources. The common factor in all these royal gifts is that they underlined the king's position as the greatest giver."

"In the unlikely case that there were strict cultural barriers between Elamites and Iranians, lan would be a border-crossing phenomenon. Instead of being exclusively Iranian, linked to Auramazda or even a Zoroastrian 'state-offering,' lan seems to fit nicely in the panorama of Elamite-Iranian acculturation. Rooted in the Elamite past and cultic tradition, Achaemenid lan came to denote a type of offering that could be performed by all kinds of cultic personnel, notably šatin and makuš. It is found in the immediate vicinity of Persepolis, but also in the old Elamite towns of Gisat, Hidali and Hunar (Huhnur; cf. App.6.2. below). Although inventories of offerings do not reflect a cultic reality (combined cults), they do enumerate offerings carried out under the aegis of a single official and performed by a single officiant in a single region. In these lists lan is found with gods of both Iranian (e.g. Išpandaramattiš) and Elamite (e.g., Napiriša, Humban) descent."

The cumulative value of these allocations is among the highest for religious purposes recorded in the Fortification archive (S5). In fact, the sip texts explicitly state that large amounts were consumed, presumably by substantial groups of people; in one case, the human beneficiaries are identified as royal muleteers (S6.3.3). The occurrence of a kurdabattis, 'chief of workers', in several texts confirms that groups of laborers, possibly consisting of up to 520 individuals, may have attended the feast. Apart from its social and ideological functions, sip also had an economic side to it (cf. S4 on lan), namely, the distribution of meat rations to laborers. "Dated texts on sip indicate that the feast was celebrated in November/December, that there was no fixed date, and that sip could be celebrated more than once during the same season. Practical reasons for such an autumnal feast involving a high amount of animal sacrifices may have been the reduction of (internal) herds owing to the scarcity of fodder during the winter season, the occurrence of the autumnal rutting season in October, and the occurrence of the first lambing season in November (S6.3.4). The official reason, on the other hand, may have been the presence of the king in Fars during the Fall season, as is suggested (however elusively) by Greek and Elamite sources. His presence at the time of at least some sip celebrations may be assumed (S6.4.1). "The royal connection is expressed not only by the timing of sip but also through the pronounced involvement of Parnakka and Zissawis in its performance and organization (paralleled only in the sumar and basur offerings, which are also directly connected to the crown [S6.2]). Since Xerxes himself claims to have performed sip (XPh), it seems reasonable to suggest that Parnakka and Zissawis acted as the king’s representatives when they presided over the feast (S6.4.2). In addition, sip is mostly celebrated at places with a marked royal character: Appistapdan, Tikranus (large plantations; royal banquets), and Pasargadae (plantation; palaces of Cyrus; coronation ceremony). Finally, an analysis of Fortification texts on poultry, cattle, and sheep/ goats suggests that animals issued for sacrificial purposes always had a specific royal "earmark" that would be understood by the people consuming these gifts from the king. Such royal food tagging is confirmed by the Greek sources (S6.4.2). "As Herodotus reports, the Persian king organized a feast called tukta, which seems to have served as a forum for the acquittal of "debts," i.e., the rewarding of services rendered to the king (S6.4.3). Though perhaps not the same feast, sip may have had similar characteristics; the participation of royal muleteers, possibly responsible for the movements of the court, in a sip ceremony would suggest so. The feast could therefore be seen as an element in a refined system of royal gift-giving in Fars as attested in Elamite and Greek sources. The common factor in all these royal gifts is that they underlined the king's position as the greatest giver."

<b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> This is a complicated variable. Shahbazi notes that 'Each province was administered by a civilian governor, the satrap ... who was aided by a military commander and treasurer. There was thus a division of powers in each satrapy, aimed at preventing concentration of power in one office with the potential for rebellion'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_526_IrAchae] Frye claims that 'We cannot clearly discern whether there was a bipartite or even a tripartite division of authority in the Achaemenid Empire', but his discussion following this statement suggests a blurring between military and executive authority both at the level of the king's court and administration of the satrapies. 'The three parties wielding power were the court, the bureaucracy (perhaps including priests) and the army. Inasmuch as the chiliarch combined military and administrative functions, as did the satraps, we may assume such a mixture in other high offices'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_527_IrAchae] The duties of the office of 'chiliarch' (a Greek term) or 'hazarapatish' (Old Persian) are themselves suggestive of a lack of separation of executive and military power. The chiliarch was a court official who served as the 'master of royal audiences', controlling access to the king and bringing him messages, as well as being commander of the King's bodyguard of a thousand men.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_528_IrAchae] (However, see Dandamaev and Lukonin 1989 for disagreements about the role of the chiliarch and the nature of the military force he commanded).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_529_IrAchae] Dandamaev and Lukonin also explain how during the fifth and fourth centuries bce, 'the suppression of uprisings by conquered peoples was the duty of the satrap. Thus, the satraps in the fourth century had troops at their disposal'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_530_IrAchae] On balance, it seems that though there was some movement towards separating the functions of military and executive authority under the Achaemenids, we cannot speak of any real 'independence', at least not at the level of the chief executive.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> While the Achaemenids 'preserved the past legal heritage in the countries they conquered, especially in Babylonia' (see Legal System section, below), they also introduced their own laws, which (theoretically) came directly from the king rather than from any independent legislative body. 'There was a dual system of laws in the empire, the "king's law" applicable everywhere, and local laws which were codified by order of the king'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_531_IrAchae] Shahbazi says that the Persian king's 'words had the force of law'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_532_IrAchae] Magdalene claims that 'All legal authority ultimately derived from the gods, who entrusted it to the king. The king, therefore, established, maintained, and defended justice (Otto, p. 268). He was not above the law but was, rather, an integral part of it. No evidence for a legislative body exists.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_533_IrAchae] King ruled law by decree but 'bound by tradition to respect the views of elders and consult great nobles on important occasions; he had to marry from the great noble's families; he could not pass arbitrary judgement; and there was always the fear of assassination if he went too far in autocracy."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_534_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> Schmitt tells us that the Persian king was a 'sovereign governor, who united in his person all power as supreme lord and judge in peace and warfare'. More specifically, he says that 'Judicial authority was in the hand of the king and special "royal judges" (Herodotus 3.31.2-3), who were chosen from the Persians and appointed by the king for life; the principle of the king's absolute and unlimited autocracy was thus maintained.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_535_IrAchae] Similarly, we read in an article by Magdalene that 'Judicial administration was ultimately under the authority of the king, and texts document his supervisory role ... although the Achaemenid kings rarely adjudicated individual cases.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_536_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Right to petition executive ♣ absent ♥</b> A widespread motif in Achaemenid iconography was the 'audience scene', showing the king on his throne, attended by servants or officials and greeted by a visitor making a 'formal gesture of respect'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_537_IrAchae] A prominent figure in the scene probably represents the chiliarch (head of the king's personal guard), who served as a powerful gatekeeper. 'He was the one who received the petitions of all those who sought an audience with the king: "Without him, none could gain audience" ... He was the one "who took messages in to the king and presented petitioners" ... or passing on their messages to the king if they were not admitted to his presence'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_538_IrAchae] However, I do not think we can characterize this as a 'right' (in a legal sense) to petition the king, and it seems that direct requests would not have been well received. Kuhrt, commenting on how royal favour could be gained through loyal service, bravery in battle, and so on, notes: 'However great a service an individual performed, asking for a favour in return or finding fault with a reward met with swift punishment'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_539_IrAchae] Cook says that for the kings who came after Cyrus the Great (who was reputedly 'approachable' and 'father-like'), 'The pinnacle of power was a lonely perch. The King lived largely in seclusion; he is said by Xenophon to have prided himself on being inaccessible'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_540_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Critique of executive by government ♣ absent ♥</b> It seems unlikely that there was a legal right for government officials to criticize the king, given that there was no independent legislative body and 'Judicial administration was ultimately under the authority of the king'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_541_IrAchae] Cook comments that since the king 'was the fountainhead of justice it was axiomatic that he could do no wrong'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_542_IrAchae] Llewellyn-Jones also stresses the strict protocols that had to be observed in audiences with the king: 'courtiers and visitors ... had to be conversant with palace protocol to ensure that they behaved with dignified decorum and observed preordained rules in the presence of the monarch'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_543_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Critique of executive by non-government ♣ absent ♥</b> Cook tells us that since the king 'was the fountainhead of justice it was axiomatic that he could do no wrong':[MAJIDBENAM_REF_544_IrAchae] in this context, it seems unlikely that there existed legal rights for agents outside the government to criticise his management of the empire. The absence of these formal rights may also be suggested by a narrative related by Ctesias and preserved by Plutarch, which (if true) implies that criticism of the king could have very serious consequences. The accounts of the Persian soldier Mithridiates and a lowborn Carian soldier of the death in battle of Cyrus the Younger, rebellious brother of Artaxerxes II, contradicted that of Artaxerxes. Ctesias claimed that both Mithdridiates and the Carian were tortured to death for this reason.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_545_IrAchae] Lincoln comments: 'Mithridiates was, apparently, charged with having exaggerated his role in Cyrus's death and with slandering the king, whose veracity he thereby implicitly impugned.' The latter offence was 'particularly grievous as it struck directly at the sources of royal legitimacy and social order ... if the king was a liar, the empire ... stood on shifting sand'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_546_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Sanction of executive by government ♣ absent ♥</b> Cook comments that since the king 'was the fountainhead of justice it was axiomatic that he could do no wrong':[MAJIDBENAM_REF_547_IrAchae] surely for government officials to (for example) impose a fine on the king would have been in direct contradiction of this infallible status. He 'was not supposed to revoke an order, still less go back on a promise that he had given'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_548_IrAchae] and his 'need to protect his own rights made him inflexible against any attempt to question his authority'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_549_IrAchae] Another indication of the likely absence of governmental sanctions of the king is the lack of an independent legislature or judiciary.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sanction of executive by non-government ♣ absent ♥</b> The king was an 'incarnation of sovereign majesty',[MAJIDBENAM_REF_550_IrAchae] the 'fountainhead of justice', and 'it was axiomatic that he could do no wrong'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_551_IrAchae] This widely attested royal status seems incompatible with a situation in which elite groups, economic groups or other agents outside the government would have the legal right to issue sanctions.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by government ♣ absent ♥</b> 'Darius and several of his successors say that Ahura Mazda "made them kings, the one the king of many, the one the lord of many" (cf. Aeschylus, Persae 762f.). This means, at the same time, that the Persian king was no primus inter pares but rather a sovereign governor, who united in his person all power as supreme lord and judge in peace and warfare and therefore stood far above his subjects ... The king was above the law and allowed to do whatever he liked (Herodotus 3.31.4).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_552_IrAchae] A passage from Llewellyn-Jones' recent book also strongly suggests a lack of constraints on the Achaemenid king: 'European Christian monarchy was counter-balanced by political groups from among the social classes and castes of the realm, whereas the absolute tribute-gathering rulers of the east tended to govern with greater independent autocracy as kings fused their political rule with their integral religious identity, so that they were not answerable to a clergy or an independent parliament.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_553_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by non-government ♣ absent ♥</b> 'Darius and several of his successors say that Ahura Mazda "made them kings, the one the king of many, the one the lord of many" (cf.

Seems significant.. A Babylonian document called the 'Cyrus Cylinder' records that believers sought Cyrus as their righteous ruler.

Achaemenid kingship shared with the more ancient Near Eastern traditions the idea that 'earthly kingship was vested in the gods so that the men who ruled on earth did so as mediators and intercessors of a divine agency.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_571_IrAchae] This subordination was reinforced through rituals of humiliation in the investiture ceremony,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_572_IrAchae] and afterwards 'the king was expected, under the auspices of the Magi, to pray and carry out rituals in Ahuramazda's honour, or to tend to the god's sacred fire'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_573_IrAchae] These aspects of sacral kingship show that the Achaemenid king had certain religious duties which he could not neglect. Indeed, if we believe pro-Persian cuneiform texts like the Cyrus Cylinder and the Nabonidus Chronicle, the dissatisfaction of the people of Babylon with King Nabonidus stemmed from his lack of devotion to Marduk, the patron god of the city (he was instead a 'devotee of the god Sin of Harran').[MAJIDBENAM_REF_574_IrAchae][MAJIDBENAM_REF_575_IrAchae] According to this narrative, the anger of the priests of Marduk at Nabonidus' 'outright heretical' behaviour helped pave the way for Cyrus the Great's conquest of Babylon.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_576_IrAchae] Nevertheless, it is difficult to find concrete examples of religious institutions acting as a real constraint on the Achaemenid king's political action.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Impeachment by religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> I have found no evidence of a legal mechanism for removing Achaemenid kings from the throne.

He appointed some of them to take the treasures in charge, and ordered others first to select from the goods handed over by Croesus an amount for the gods, as the magi might stipulate'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_582_IrAchae] The Zoroastrianism practised by the Achaemenid kings was a local form which Skjaervo describes as essentially 'polytheistic ... but with one god, Ahura Mazda, outranking the others.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_583_IrAchae] This may go some way towards explaining why they frequently made gifts of money and offers of support to the priests and temples of other faiths. For instance, after Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon, he restored Esagila, the temple of Marduk, and the Cyrus Cylinder records him acknowledging the support of this Mesopotamian god.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_584_IrAchae] Shortly after Darius the Great came to power in 522 bce, he 'commanded that funds for the rebuilding [of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem] should be provided out of the tribute of the satrapy, and that sacrificial animals, corn, wine and whatever else was necessary should be given to the priests in Jerusalem, so that they might offer sacrifices there to their God, "and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons".'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_585_IrAchae] However, there were good political reasons for this (Palestine occupying a strategic position on the road from Persia to Egypt),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_586_IrAchae] so how far Darius was motivated by belief in any supernatural agent is a matter of debate.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ present ♥</b> Dynastic succession from father to first-born son (male primogeniture) was the usual mechanism, although Frye asserts that this was not a 'iron-clad rule' for the Achaemenids: instead, 'the ruler designated whomsoever of his sons he wanted to succeed him.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_587_IrAchae] In any case, there were several exceptions to the rule over the course of the empire's history. 'Kingship in the Persian empire seemingly was hereditary within the Achaemenid dynasty. If descent by Achaemenid blood was an essential foundation of the Achaemenids' kingship, it is no wonder that the kings reiterated the last element of their title, Haxamanisiya, "an Achaemenid." The succession seems to have been settled by the king's designation (Herodotus 7.2.1). Usually the heir was the first-born son, and only by way of exception (cf. Plutarch, Artaxerxes 2.4) the son born first after accession' ...

Shahbazi is confident of the existence of multiple legal systems: 'By royal decree, local jurists codified the laws of their own nations, and imperial authorities then enforced those laws.

'Darius [I] had Egyptian legal scholars codify their national law and enforced it in the name of the royal authority'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_658_IrAchae] We also read in Dandamaev and Lukonin that 'Extremely diverse legal systems and institutions, which ranged from the very primitive to the highly developed, existed in the Achaemenid state. The conquests of the Persians did not lead to dramatic changes in the legal traditions and norms of the vanquished peoples.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_659_IrAchae] However, Fried has examined legal documents from Achaemenid-era Egypt and Yehud and come to a different conclusion: 'The use of Persian loanwords in the Egyptian texts implies a completely Persian judicial system in the Egyptian satrapy, with judges, police, and intelligence officers all Iranian. The same would have been true throughout the empire, including the satrapy of Beyond the River and the province of Yehud.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_660_IrAchae] She also believes that 'The Persians may have authorized the Jews to collect and transcribe the customs and traditions of Yehud, as they did in Egypt.

The wages for slave labor were the equal of the wages of the free hired laborer, but differed from the latter in that the slave tried to avoid work in every possible way'. In Achaemenid-period Babylonia (at least outside the royal and temple economy), hired wage labour made a larger contribution to economic production than slave labour.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_816_IrAchae] More generally, Llewellyn-Jones comments: 'Persia did not have an extensive slave economy and, as Dandamayev (1988) emphasises: on the whole, there was only a small number of slaves in relation to the number of free persons even in the most developed countries of the Achaemenid empire, and slave labour was in no position to supplant the labour of free workers.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_817_IrAchae] When Cyrus entered Babylonia he 'released all the exiles and enslaved peoples' returned statues of gods Babylonians had stolen, and undertook many restoration works.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_818_IrAchae]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Proportion of population enserfed ♣ unknown ♥</b> It is difficult to find estimates of the proportion of the population enserfed across the Achaemenid Empire - probably because of the fragmentary nature of the archives that have come down to us - and this would have varied dramatically between satrapies.

Then, 'After using these enchantments and many others besides on the river, they passed over it at the Nine Ways in Edonian country, by the bridges which they found thrown across the Strymon. When they learned that Nine Ways was the name of the place, they buried alive that number of boys and maidens, children of the local people. To bury people alive is a Persian custom; I have learned by inquiry that when Xerxes' wife Amestris reached old age, she buried twice seven sons of notable Persians as an offering on her own behalf to the fabled god beneath the earth.'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_837_IrAchae] Boyce comments: 'Problems concerning Xerxes' beliefs were created by Herodotus' account of incidents during his Greek war. Human sacrifice (Herodotus 7.114) was certainly profoundly at odds with Zoroastrian morality, and presumably represents an ancient pagan custom revived under stress of war (or in the case of Queen Amestris, of old age).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_838_IrAchae] Similarly, Martin stresses the 'reverence for human life' which characterised the Zoroastrian morality adopted by Persian kings[MAJIDBENAM_REF_839_IrAchae] (although this never stopped the Persian elite from waging war or sentencing criminals to death). Keeping in mind that if the Greek historians had heard of other instances of human sacrifice, they almost certainly would have recorded them, I think we must agree with Boyce here.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Low social class ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Elites ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Retainers ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Outsiders ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Jenny Reddish ♥</b> <i>These codes were developed at Seshat General Workshop in Oxford 2017 and Axial Age Workshop, Oxford, 2015</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name of Official Cult ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ alternate Names of Official Cult ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name of other significant religious or ideological systems ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Deification_of_Rulers">Deification of Rulers</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IrAchae&amp;action=edit&amp;section=67" title="Edit section: Deification of Rulers">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b>The Cyrus Cylinder (composed by priests of Marduk as a record of Cyrus the Great's conquest of Babylon and his proclamations) records that 'Bel-Marduk cast his eye over all countries, seeking for a righteous ruler ...

'"Righteous women" were those who were acquiescent and conforming, showing "reverence and obedience to their husbands", and abstaining from sin (AWN 13.1-11). Those women who abused or defied their husbands or who ignored their maternal duty to their children would condemn their own souls to hell (AWN 26, 59).'[MAJIDBENAM_REF_961_IrAchae] Chapter 15 of the Videvdad deals with (among other things) 'a man's obligations to a natural child and its mother'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_962_IrAchae] These texts are considered to incorporate older, oral religious traditions, and it seems likely that Achaemenid-period Zoroastrianism would have also laid down ethical prescriptions for the treatment of family members.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> We could consider this to be 'absent' because several sources discuss the development of early, pre-Achaemenid Zoroastrianism as, in part, a reaction against the 'patriarchal and militaristic values' of ancient Iranian 'pastoral-nomadic society'. Zoroaster's 'teaching seems largely aimed at criticizing the central values of his society - bull sacrifice and the consumption of a hallucinogenic beverage known as haoma - as being inappropriately orgiastic, violent, and excessive. Another major theme in Zoroaster's teaching is his opposition to the taking by force of livestock and other wealth by the strong from the weak and the ravaging of pasturelands, which he saw as disruptions of the natural order'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_963_IrAchae] The roots of the religion, then, seem to stress peaceful coexistence rather than valour in battle. On the other hand, Darius the Great's Behistun inscription aims to convey a sense of his military strength, always aided and approved of by Ahura Mazda.
