for areas of Central Anatolia is based on a modified version of the three-age system developed in European archaeology (Stone, Bronze and Iron ages). For areas of Anatolia, two additional terms were introduced: Aceramic Neolithic and Chalcolithic. The latter is not, as the name would suggest, determined on the basis of copper artifacts, but on the basis of the emergence of painted pottery. It derives from Mesopotamia, where the division of the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic was related to the introduction of painted pottery.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The most recent attempt to construct a healthy chronological scheme for the Central Anatolian Neolithic was proposed by the CANeW workshop[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_TrClcER]. On the basis of the archaeological evidence from various sites in the region, the time trajectories of the development were identified, taking into account not a wide scope of aspects - architectural developments, burial practices, material culture (pottery, lithic industry, metallurgy etc.) and economy. The main unit of the proposed scheme is ECA - Early Central Anatolian. The ECA IV (6000-5500 cal BC) corresponds to what is conventionally labeled as 'Early Chalcolithic'.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the start of the Early Chalcolithic, around 6000 cal. BC, we can see a continuation of the changes settlement patterns that began in the Late Neolithic. This period is marked by a shift in settlement from Çatalhöyük East to Çatalhöyük West and the existence of full- farming sites such as Can Hasan I, Koşk Höyük and Tepecik-Çiftlik. The number of sites in the region increased [MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The date 5500 cal BC marks a major disruption: most of the sites were abandoned. This date marks the beginning of the Middle Chalcolithic - it is a completely new period different from the preceding, a prelude of a new system[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_TrClcER]. The nature of this major breakage is still under-recognized.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As for radiocarbon dating:The levels II-V (Neolithic and Chalcolithic)of Koşk Höyük date to 6300-5600 cal BC[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_TrClcER].From the Early Chalcolithic Level 3 at Tepecik - Çiftlik, we have a single c14 date - around 6000 BC[MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_TrClcER].Six radiocarbon dates are available from Can Hasan 2B which, when combined, provide a time range between 5715-5635 cal. BCE. Absolute dates from levels 7-3 are not available[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_TrClcER].As for the Çatalhöyük West, the c14 samples were taken from a deep sounding and cannot draw a conclusive picture yet. Nevertheless, onedate 5980 to 5810 cal BC (68% probability[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_TrClcER]).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣  ♥</b>The area of Central Anatolia is distinct for the fact that each site corresponds to a separate culture.

However, it is possible that Can Hasan I, which would provide smaller villages with raw materials, could have had a similar function. Also, Çatalhöyük West, with its 8 ha, is much larger than other sites, and it has beem suggested that it played a role of a central site[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_TrClcER].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Indo-European language ♥</b>  Indo-European language&nbsp;?

There is a hypothesis proposed by Colin Renfrew in 1987 - that Indo-European languages ​​began to spread with the beginning of agriculture[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The work on this codebook is focused on the area of the Central Anatolia Plain (including Cappadocia with occasional references to Cilicia) and North-Central Anatolia within the bend of the Kızılırmak River. The main sites include Çatalhöyük West, Canhasan, Yümüktepe / Mersin, Köşk Höyük, Gelveri Güzelyurt, Tepecik - Çiftlik, Gözlükule / Tarsus. The majority of the data was obtained from reports of excavations at three of the mentioned sites: Çatalhöyük West, Canhasan and Köşk Höyük. The chronology for areas of Central Anatolia is based on a modified version of the three-age system developed in European archaeology (Stone, Bronze and Iron ages). However, for the Anatolian areas, it was necessary to introduce two additional terms: Aceramic Neolithic and Chalcolithic. The latter was to be determined on the basis of copper artifacts. However, it became known that the origins of manufacturing copper tools date back to Aceramic Neolithic. So, instead, the beginning of the Chalcolithic in Central Anatolia came to be determined by the emergence of painted pottery.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Some geometric wall paintings and decorations on ceramics from the Early Chalcolithic period have been found, and can be considered as 'Nonwritten records'. Pottery in the Early Chalcolithic is mostly painted. The majority of these paintings are red or brown straight-line geometric motifs, applied over a cream or yellowish-buff slip. In addition to the expanded production of ceramics, stone and flint was used for tools. However, the dominant material for manufacturing tools was obsidian, which was probably imported from the Ilıcapınar areas (Cappadocian sources- Niğde area, where sites of Tepecik - Çiftlik and Köşk Höyük are located-PF). Metallurgy of the period is not different from that of the Neolithic, except for copper pins and small ornaments at Mersin XXII-XXI.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The area of Central Anatolia is distinguished by the fact that each site corresponds to a separate culture. However, the contacts between them are possible, since there are similarities in the pottery decorations and in architecture.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Completing the codebook for Early Chalcolithic Konya Plain was not an easy task, as we do not always have a requisite amount of relevant data from archaeological research. However, an attempt was made to reconstruct the functioning of the societies of the Early Chalcolithic period, based on the data available. The information was primarily gathered from the reports from excavations, as well as general studies on prehistoric areas of Anatolia. The most problematic variables were, for example, "Society variables" , "Law", "Bureaucracy characteristics", for it is a society for which we have no written sources.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Floors were made of compact clay.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Many clay figurines were recovered from one of the burnt structures (House 3) at Can Hasan in 2B level as well as a clay spindle-whorl; sling stones; stoppers; and animal figurines. Some of the women figurines in various sizes are flat and schematic; but the eyes; ears; nose; and chin were clearly depicted. Plain or painted ones are existent. Another group was depicted in crouching or sitting position. Their necks are high and details are observed to be shown besides the chin. They are all painted." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_TrClcER] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Çatalhöyük West, L-shaped clay objects were found, with geometric incised decorations. The same objects were also found in Çatalhöyük East [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_TrClcER].In total,  nearly 400 of those objects were recorded at Çatalhöyük[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_TrClcER]. These are the so-called 'potstands'. Placed in pairs over the fire they would support a cooking pot[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_TrClcER]. As they appear in the Late Neolithic, they may be an important index of shift away the use of interior fixed architectural fire installations for cooking, towards the use of ceramic vessels balanced on potstands [MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Potstands have been also found at Can Hasan (mainly in levels II and I).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In all Chalcolithic Age levels of Yumuktepe; baked clay spindle whorls and clay sling pallets are the dominant types. There are also loom weights and a number of figurines." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"At Gelveri Güzelyurt a baked clay animal figurine is the only figurine for now. There are other clay finds like a brush and a pintaderas stamp. A female figurine was found during 2007 excavations made of terra cotta with coarse paste in beige color." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Köşk Höyük in level I were found two female figurines: one seated, the other standing and two horn-shaped objects recovered in the so-called sanctuary[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrClcER]. Also at level II, there were more female figurines found, whole and pieces.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Wooden supports in two-storied buildings. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It may be assumed the wood was easily obtained as the forests covered vast areas in the region [MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Pieces of blades and flakes were found at 2A at Can Hasan."

In general; blade and large flake industries are dominant. Both obsidian and flint are used." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Obsidian tools were found at Gelveri Güzelyurt: knives and scrapers shaped from flake-blades. Long sickle blades are also present. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Köşk Höyük, obsidian is the dominant material for producing tools.Also, pieces of obsidian mirrors have been found.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Cappadocian sources - Göllüdağ and Nenezi Dağ- are of significance since the Neolithic period[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Polychrome stone vessels; stone and shell beads; axes; marble bracelets; and grinding stones were recovered from the 2A level at Can Hasan."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_TrClcER]" Grinding stones; mortar; pestles; shallow bowls; spouted vessels; marble bracelets; and stopper were recovered from the 2B structures."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_TrClcER] "The ground stone finds of the third level consist of pestles; grinding stones; and beads."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_TrClcER][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Small stone bowls made out of white or red- green marble were recovered from Köşk Höyük; other stone finds include: celts, querns, mortars, pestles, hammering and grinding stones[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At Tepecik-Çiftlik stone artefacts include mortars, pestles, grinding slabs, basins made of basalt and rhyolite, axes made of limestone and basalt and finally- polishing stones made out of pebbles[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_TrClcER].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The site of Çatalhöyük West brought about a number of stone tools: these are grinding stones (querns), axes, pestles and stone vessels[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_TrClcER].

These features differ from other types of midden deposits and house fills at the site and are densely packed with ash, charcoal and thousands of charred animal bones including the remains of sheep and goats, but also large quantities of cattle (mostly aurochs) and wild equids. The overwhelming abundance of animal resources represented in these features, which likely functioned as roasting pits, indicates that large-scale and public consumption of both domesticates and wild prey was a regular part of the social system at EC Kösk. "The waste in these large roasting pits includes concentrations of meaty caprine parts including forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 6) while foot and ankle remains are highly under-represented in these features, as are heads, despite the fact that the latter are the most abundant elements in the entire assemblage. This contrasts to the pattern for domestic contexts, including middens adjacent to houses, where butchery waste, including heads, feet and ankles, is better represented (Fig. 6). These contrasts between skeletal part profiles from roasting pits and domestic middens suggest a situation in which partially-processed caprine carcasses were provided by individual households for consumption during important events involving public feasting. "In addition, roasting pits contain higher concentrations of wild taxa than typical domestic trash with large animals, including wild equids and cattle, representing an average of 42-62% of the animals remains compared to 21-29% from domestic contexts. Skeletal part profiles for cattle and equids from roasting pits in area F9 show skeletal part frequencies that indicate entire carcasses were available for consumption at these feasting events (Fig. 7). However, not all portions of the carcass are present in equal quantities suggesting that a cultural logic structured the apportionment of beef and equid meat at these feasts. "For cattle, scapulae are the most abundant element, paralleling the common use of this meaty element in commemorative deposits at Çatalhöyük (Russell et al., 2009), while elements including humerus, ulna, metapodials, and femora are under-represented (less than 50% of&nbsp;%MAU) (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, this indicates that the upper portions of both forelimbs and hindlimbs (humerus and femur) were under-represented, a pattern suggesting the presence of rules relating to the distribution of these elements and the consumption of the sizable portions of meat and marrow associated with them—perhaps by the hunters/owners of the carcass. A similar pattern is evident for equids (Fig. 7C): the innominate and scapula are the most common elements along with metapodials, which are unusually abundant in these pit features, while the elements of the upper portions of fore and hindlimbs limbs are under- represented. In contrast, skeletal part frequencies for cattle from domestic contexts show a different pattern in which remains often classified as butchery waste, including metapodials and feet, are well represented, while the most abundant elements in the pit features (scapula, tibia, and talus) are under-represented (Fig. 7B). This pat- tern is complementary to that of the pit features suggesting that the distribution of cattle remains was structured by a complex set of rules with some carcass portions consumed in public feasting events while other portions were distributed for consumption by individual households." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_130_TrClcER] "At EC Kösk, large-scale, socially empowering feasting events, evident from the remains of large roasting pits as well as the abundance of elaborately decorated ceramic vessels (Öztan, 2010), provided a major context for social competition with the acts of production, apportioning, and consumption of domestic and wild animals both reflecting and renegotiating social status within this household-based community. Skeletal part distributions in feasting deposits suggest that partially processed caprine carcasses including concentrations of meaty parts were provided for these events, probably by individual households. In addition, both wild and domestic cattle and equids were apportioned according to cultural rules with scapulae and lower leg elements provided for public consumption while the upper elements of the fore and hindlimb were distributed elsewhere. "Through the provisioning of both wild and domestic animals as well as the apportionment of individual carcass parts based on well-defined and hierarchical rules, these events would have provided highly visible opportunities for the expression of social inequalities functioning as what Dietler (2001, p. 76) has called 'empowering feasts' with subtle but real political consequences for those able to give generously. These feasting performances likely created socially sanctioned competitive environments, or 'tournaments of value' (Appadurai, 1986), in which prestige and informal power were actively sought by multiple parties. Thus, the ability to give generously and to be apportioned high quality cuts of meat at public feasting events may have been central mechanisms by which social differences were measured and defined (Black-Michaud, 1986; Dietler, 2001; Helwing, 2003). These types of socially important, and potentially competitive feasting activities have a long history in the Near East where 'gastro-politics' (Appadurai, 1981, p. 494) seem to have been a fundamental component of many Neolithic and Chalcolithic communities (Ben-Shlomo et al., 2009; Bogaard et al., 2009; Goring-Morris and Horwitz, 2007; Helwing, 2003; Kansa and Campbell, 2004; Twiss, 2008)."

extensive network of large but shallow pit features concentrated in the northwestern portion of the settlement. These features differ from other types of midden deposits and house fills at the site and are densely packed with ash, charcoal and thousands of charred animal bones including the remains of sheep and goats, but also large quantities of cattle (mostly aurochs) and wild equids. The overwhelming abundance of animal resources represented in these features, which likely functioned as roasting pits, indicates that large-scale and public consumption of both domesticates and wild prey was a regular part of the social system at EC Kösk. "The waste in these large roasting pits includes concentrations of meaty caprine parts including forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 6) while foot and ankle remains are highly under-represented in these features, as are heads, despite the fact that the latter are the most abundant elements in the entire assemblage. This contrasts to the pattern for domestic contexts, including middens adjacent to houses, where butchery waste, including heads, feet and ankles, is better represented (Fig. 6). These contrasts between skeletal part profiles from roasting pits and domestic middens suggest a situation in which partially-processed caprine carcasses were provided by individual households for consumption during important events involving public feasting. "In addition, roasting pits contain higher concentrations of wild taxa than typical domestic trash with large animals, including wild equids and cattle, representing an average of 42-62% of the animals remains compared to 21-29% from domestic contexts. Skeletal part profiles for cattle and equids from roasting pits in area F9 show skeletal part frequencies that indicate entire carcasses were available for consumption at these feasting events (Fig. 7). However, not all portions of the carcass are present in equal quantities suggesting that a cultural logic structured the apportionment of beef and equid meat at these feasts. "For cattle, scapulae are the most abundant element, paralleling the common use of this meaty element in commemorative deposits at Çatalhöyük (Russell et al., 2009), while elements including humerus, ulna, metapodials, and femora are under-represented (less than 50% of&nbsp;%MAU) (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, this indicates that the upper portions of both forelimbs and hindlimbs (humerus and femur) were under-represented, a pattern suggesting the presence of rules relating to the distribution of these elements and the consumption of the sizable portions of meat and marrow associated with them—perhaps by the hunters/owners of the carcass. A similar pattern is evident for equids (Fig. 7C): the innominate and scapula are the most common elements along with metapodials, which are unusually abundant in these pit features, while the elements of the upper portions of fore and hindlimbs limbs are under- represented. In contrast, skeletal part frequencies for cattle from domestic contexts show a different pattern in which remains often classified as butchery waste, including metapodials and feet, are well represented, while the most abundant elements in the pit features (scapula, tibia, and talus) are under-represented (Fig. 7B). This pat- tern is complementary to that of the pit features suggesting that the distribution of cattle remains was structured by a complex set of rules with some carcass portions consumed in public feasting events while other portions were distributed for consumption by individual households." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_141_TrClcER] "At EC Kösk, large-scale, socially empowering feasting events, evident from the remains of large roasting pits as well as the abundance of elaborately decorated ceramic vessels (Öztan, 2010), provided a major context for social competition with the acts of production, apportioning, and consumption of domestic and wild animals both reflecting and renegotiating social status within this household-based community. Skeletal part distributions in feasting deposits suggest that partially processed caprine carcasses including concentrations of meaty parts were provided for these events, probably by individual households. In addition, both wild and domestic cattle and equids were apportioned according to cultural rules with scapulae and lower leg elements provided for public consumption while the upper elements of the fore and hindlimb were distributed elsewhere. "Through the provisioning of both wild and domestic animals as well as the apportionment of individual carcass parts based on well-defined and hierarchical rules, these events would have provided highly visible opportunities for the expression of social inequalities functioning as what Dietler (2001, p. 76) has called 'empowering feasts' with subtle but real political consequences for those able to give generously. These feasting performances likely created socially sanctioned competitive environments, or 'tournaments of value' (Appadurai, 1986), in which prestige and informal power were actively sought by multiple parties. Thus, the ability to give generously and to be apportioned high quality cuts of meat at public feasting events may have been central mechanisms by which social differences were measured and defined (Black-Michaud, 1986; Dietler, 2001; Helwing, 2003). These types of socially important, and potentially competitive feasting activities have a long history in the Near East where 'gastro-politics' (Appadurai, 1981, p. 494) seem to have been a fundamental component of many Neolithic and Chalcolithic communities (Ben-Shlomo et al., 2009; Bogaard et al., 2009; Goring-Morris and Horwitz, 2007; Helwing, 2003; Kansa and Campbell, 2004; Twiss, 2008)."
