This led them to an interest in Tibetan Buddhism (Lamaism) more than in the Three Teachings, yet they feared the gods sufficiently to show respect toward any religious professional who could claim to have access to esoteric knowledge. Buddhist monks and Daoist priests competed for Mongol patronage, debating each other most famously in a grand court debate in 1258, but the regime declined to support one and suppress the other, so long as adherents of each could demonstrate the value of their teaching for bringing good fortune. It may have been the effort of Chinese trying to explain the multiplicity of their traditions to the Mongols— or was it the Mongols trying to reflect their understanding back to their new subjects?—that encouraged the people of the Yuan to see an underlying unity in their systems of beliefs. The Three Teachings did not inhabit three separate categories, but rested within a single category. Sectarian adherents of the three different traditions still fought amongst themselves for state recognition and preferential treatment, but those who were less partisan in their beliefs felt free to engage eclectically, even erratically, with all the traditions."

This polity, ruling from China, was to be known as the Yuan Dynasty, and lasted from 1271 CE until its eventual demise in 1368.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Yuan Dynasty was a continuation of the Mongolian Empire. However, Genghis Khan's empire had by this time fractured into rival Khanates, including the Chagatai Khanate, the Ilkhanate, and the Golden Horde. Although the Yuan Emperor was the nominal overlord of these regions, the Khanates were effectively independent.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CnYuan*] The Yuan's core territory covered North China, Manchuria, and the Inner Mongolian steppe,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CnYuan*] but military campaigns saw it expand over most of China, Tibet and into Korea.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CnYuan*] However, their attempt to conquer Japan was thwarted by a typhoon.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnYuan*] Eventually, internal dissensions between the various <i>ordos</i> (political units) and local rebellions dissolved the fabric of the empire and led to its disaggregation.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Yuan Empire was a sociopolitical blend of Chinese and Mongolian features. At the top of the administrative, religious and military hierarchy sat the emperor, ruling under the traditional Chinese 'Mandate of Heaven'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnYuan*] Kublai Khan was the embodiment of a strong central authority, but the balance he created was only maintained for about 30 years after his death before emperors started to lose internal and external control over the Yuan dominion.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnYuan*] Administratively, the empire was modelled on its Jin predecessor, and ruled through a variety of entities such as the Secretariat, the Military Affairs Bureau, and the Censorate.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnYuan*] However, it also retained Mongolian institutions, such as the <i>keshig</i> (imperial guard) and the <i>ordos</i>, which corresponded to the palace-tents, household and staff of various princes and lords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnYuan*] These <i>ordos</i> acted as separate vassal states under nominal imperial control.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnYuan*] In terms of territorial administration, the Yuan Dynasty comprised 12 provinces.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnYuan*] In total, the population of Yuan China may have been between 60[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnYuan*] and 85 million.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Communications across the vast empire were facilitated by an elaborate postal system, described in detail by Marco Polo. There were 1,400 relay stations located every 25 to 50 kilometres along the main axes of communication, and messengers could cover up to 400 kilometres a day to relay urgent news.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnYuan*] Resources could be controlled by the state thanks to the use of paper currency, issued in proportion to silver reserves, and a commercial tax on the government-sponsored <i>ortoq</i> merchant class.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CnYuan*] Another significant source of wealth was the salt monopoly, which had reached 80 percent of the government's income by 1320.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kublai oversaw the construction of a new capital, known as Dadu to the Chinese, Khanbalik to the Turks and Daidu to the Mongols, on the site of modern Beijing.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_CnYuan*] At its height, Dadu may have had 600,000 inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_CnYuan*] The location of this city in the vicinity of the northern frontier enabled Kublai to retain control over the Mongolian homeland.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_CnYuan*] Its architecture and design embodied the syncretism of Mongolian and Chinese influences: it featured two inner walls and an imperial city, but also had avenues wide enough for nine horsemen to gallop abreast, and Mongolian yurts flourished in its parks.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_CnYuan*] The court was cosmopolitan and although Kublai followed Tantric Buddhism, he also had Confucian advisors[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_CnYuan*] and welcomed foreigners such as the Polo family. The Yuan were patrons of education through state schools and temples; state organizations sponsored the study of Confucianism, astronomy, historiography and medicine.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Yuan China encompassed a territory that fluctuated between roughly 11 and 24 million square kilometres, supporting a population of between 60 and 85 million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_CnYuan*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Yuan ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ Yuan_1300CE: 1271CE-1368CE ♥</b> Yuan_1300CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_CnYuan*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣ 12050076: 1271CE-1368CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Mongolic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Eastern Mongolic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Mongolian ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Shamanism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Mongolian Shamanism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Chinese Buddhism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition2 ♣ Daoism ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Po-Ju Tuan; Enrico Cioni ♥</b> EC coded Hierarchical Complexity variables.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=CnYuan*&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ [24,000,000-11,000,000]: 1300 CE ♥</b> in squared kilometers. 21,000,000: 1271 CE; 22,000,000: 1280 CE; 23,500,000: 1290 CE; 24,000,000: 1309 CE; 11,000,000: 1310 CE; 10,750,000: 1320 CE; 10,500,000: 1330 CE; 10,250,000: 1340 CE; 10,000,000: 1350 CE; 7,500,000: 1360 CE.

For a very detailed description of the Yuan administrative system, see Endicott-West (1994).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1. Emperor[MAJIDBENAM_BR]__Central Government__[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div>2. Central Secretariat<div>"The Central Secretariat was the nerve center of the entire civilian bureaucracy. Most other agencies in the Yuan structure of communication and control were ultimately responsible to it. All memorials to the emperor, with the exception of those written by high-ranking military and censorial officials, for example, passed through the Central Secretariat. In turn, that office was empowered to make recommendations, draft regulations, and make responses subject to imperial approval. In addition to its role as communication center, the Central Secretariat controlled official appointments to virtually all civilian offices in the empire." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_40_CnYuan*] "The top official in the Central Secretariat was the chung-shu ling, in Khubilai's reign a post assumed by the heir apparent. Because the chung-shu ling was most often left vacant throughout the Yuan, the next two subordinate officials, the councillor of the right (yu ch'eng-hsiang) and the councillor of the left (tso ch'eng-hsiang), were in effect the highest civil officials in the empire. They in turn had direct control over the six ministries, the ministries of Personnel (Li-pu), Revenue (Hu-pu), Rites (Li-pu), War (Ping-pu), Pun- ishments (Hsing-pu), and Works (Kung-pu.)" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_41_CnYuan*]</div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>3. Ministry of Personnel<div>"Of the six ministries, all formally established under Khubilai, the Ministry of Personnel was arguably the most influential, by virtue of its power to appoint civilian officials throughout the empire. Regional and local officials, the only civilian officials with whom commoners might have had direct contact, were regularly evaluated by the Ministry of Personnel for promotion, demotion, and transfer once in office." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_42_CnYuan*]</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>3. Ministry of Revenue<div>"The Ministry of Revenue was charged with overseeing population censuses, taxation records, state treasuries, currency, and government manufacturing. One of this ministry's most important duties was enforcing the numerous and elaborate Yiian regulations concerning paper currency. Because the Yiian government was committed to the empirewide circulation of paper notes, the procedures necessary for printing and administering paper currency were extensive. The government's deep concern is suggested by the fact that counterfeiting paper money was punishable by death." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_43_CnYuan*]</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>3. Ministry of Rites<div>"In terms of political and economic authority, the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Rites was far more narrowly defined than that of either the Ministry of Personnel or the Ministry of Revenue. Court ceremonies, music, assemblies, and sacrifices came under its aegis, as did such matters as granting posthumous titles, provisioning the imperial kitchen, and manufacturing the imperial seals. The authority of the Ministry of Rites did, however, extend beyond the limited sphere of court etiquette into the realm of sumptuary regulations, marriage rites, mourning rites, and burial rites, all of which affected commoners to a certain degree. In addition, the ministry upheld the rights of the different ethnic groups in Yiian China to practice their own particular rituals and not to have to conform to Chinese standards. Uighurs, for example, were directed to conduct their mourning in accordance with their own regulations; if they were to ignore their own mourning customs and follow instead Chinese practices, they would be subject to confiscation of their property. The Ministry of Rites was also charged with administering the state schools and regulating religious establishments." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_44_CnYuan*]</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>3. Ministry of War<div>"Of the six ministries, the Ministry of War was the least significant, as the real military authority in Yuan times resided in the Privy Council (Shu-mi yuan). The Privy Council, established in 1263, was at the pinnacle of a separate military bureaucracy, whereas the Ministry of War was subordinate to the Central Secretariat within the civilian bureaucracy. The insignificance of the Ministry of War is demonstrated by the fact that the Ping chih (Monograph on the military) in the Yuan shih (Official history of the Yuan) does not even mention the Ministry of War in its description of the structure of the Yuan military, instead stating that 'the Privy Council was set up to take 7 overall charge.' All military offices, including the imperial guard (su-wei), were ultimately responsible to the Privy Council in the military chain of command."[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The main duties of the Ministry of War were to manage the population rosters of military colonies and postal personnel, manage the requisitioning of animals for military purposes, and oversee the provisioning of postal relay stations. By 1320, however, the Ministry of War had relinquished its jurisdiction over the postal relay stations to the Bureau of Transmission (T'ung-cheng yuan), which had been created in 1276 separate from the military bureaucracy to supervise the postal relay system. All in all, the powerlessness of the Ministry of War reflects the Mongols' discomfort at having their military establishment subordinate to a civil branch of government. By investing power in the Privy Council the Yuan rulers were able to keep military affairs separate and secret from the civilian bureaucracy. In fact, the description of the Privy Council in the Yuan shih opens with the observation that it was 'charged with responsibility over military armaments and secret [military] affairs throughout the empire'." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_45_CnYuan*]</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>3. Ministry of Punishment<div>"The Ministry of Punishment's duties were drafting criminal laws, review- ing cases involving capital punishment, and registering criminals' dependents and confiscated goods. In comparison with that of earlier dynasties, the Yuan Ministry of Punishments gained in importance because it took over the responsibilities for judicial review that in previous times had rested with the Grand Court of Judicial Review (Ta-li ssu). The Grand Court originated in Northern Ch'i and Sui times and functioned as the highest legal agency in the Chinese empire, but it did not exist as such in Yuan times. For a brief time, from 1283 to 1285, a Grand Court existed in name only as a temporary redesignation of the Court of Justice for Uighurs (Tu-hu fu). Thus, by not having a Grand Court of Judicial Review, the Ministry of Punishments resolved and implemented legal decisions, which were subject only to an occasional revision by the Central Secretariat or the emperor himself." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_46_CnYuan*]</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>3. Ministry of Works<div>"The sixth ministry, the Ministry of Works, supervised government work- shops, the repair of fortifications, the assignment and labor of government artisans, the evaluation of artisan officials, and the conscription of laborers for government projects." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_47_CnYuan*]</div></div></div>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]__Provincial Government__[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<div><div>3. Branch Secretariats<div>"The permanently established Branch Secretariats (Hsing chung-shu sheng or hsing-sheng), which numbered eleven in all, were formally established during Khubilai's reign in order to manage the affairs of lesser territorial- administrative units, to pacify frontier areas, to manage the transport of grain, and to take overall charge of military and civil affairs at the regional level. They were directly answerable to the Central Secretariat in terms of the structure of communication and control. [...] Despite the consolidation of separate civil and military bureaucracies under Khubilai, civil and military jurisdictions were united at the level of the Branch Secretariats. The Branch Secretariats held authority over most garrison troops stationed throughout the empire, except in dire emergencies when Branch Privy Councils were temporarily established." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_48_CnYuan*][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Yuan civilian government departed from earlier patterns and precedents in Chinese governmental history in the multiplicity of its levels of sub- metropolitan government and in the sheer number of civilian officials staffing those units of government. Thus, the levels of government subordinate to the Branch Secretariats were (in descending order): circuit (tao), route (lu), prefecture (san-fu or fu), subprefecture {chou), county (hsien), and special districts under the jurisdiction of lu or fu called lu-shih ssu. Not every unit was necessarily present on every level in the administrative hierarchy. In other words, eight of the eleven Branch Secretariats directly administered prefectures that were not subordinate to an intermediate route. In addition to administering seven routes, the Branch Secretariat of Kan-su (Kan-su teng- ch'u hsing chung-shu sheng) also directly administered two subprefectures."

The imperial family attended in person the Buddhist celebratory processions and plays in the first month of the New Year at which Chinese, Muslim, and Tangut musicians entertained.'

On this occasion, the governors of provinces, and rulers of cities, and all who are in office or authority, send presents to the khan, of gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones, likewise of many white cloths of various kinds, and other white things, and many white horses. It is the custom of those who bring presents, if they can, to present nine times nine of every particular article, whether it be gold, or silver, cloths, or horses; and on this occasion, the khan sometimes receives 100,000 horses. On this grand festival, all the elephants belonging to the great khan, about 5000, are brought into the great court palace, covered with splendid housings of tapestry, wrought with the figures of various kinds of birds and beast, each of them bearing on their backs two chests filled with vessels of gold and silver; and many camels are paraded on the same occasion, covered over, with fine silken cloths, and loaded with other necessaries for the court. "On the morning of this festival of the new year, all the captains, barons, soldiers, physicians, astrologers, governors of provinces, generals of armies, and other officers of the great khan, assemble before the emperor, in the great hall of the palace, all placed in due order, according to their rank and dignity, and those who have no place or employment, stand without, that they may see the ceremonies. One of the heads of their priests then rises, and cries out with a loud voice, 'Bow down and adore,' on which all who are present bend down their foreheads to the earth. He then calls out aloud, 'God preserve our khan, and grant him long life and happiness;' and all the people answer, 'God grant this.' Then he says, 'May God increase and advance his empire, and preserve all his subjects, in peace, concord, and prosperity;' and the people say, 'God grant this our prayer.' All this is repeated four times. Then the chief priest goes forward to a red table or altar, richly adorned, on which the name of the khan is written; and taking a censer, containing rich spices and perfumes, he perfumes the altar or table with great reverence, in honour of the khan, and returns to his place in the assembly. After the conclusion of this ceremony, the various gifts which have been already mentioned are presented to the khan. And then the tables are prepared, and a most solemn and splendid feast is served up, of which all the assistants, with their wives, partake, eating and drinking with great joy, as formerly described. In the course of this solemn feast, a tame lion is led up to the khan, which lies down at his feet as gentle as a whelp, acknowledging and caressing his lord."

Those in charge of states, fiefs, and families were privileged and obliged to officiate at rites; those not so privileged were expected to assist in whatever capacity was appropriate to them. The chief sacrificer had to purify himself in advance through abstinence of varying duration. At the appointed time, he would enter the consecrated ancestral shrine, bow, prostrate himself, and make offerings of food and wine. He was assisted by a variety of attendants, including those who prepared the food, took charge of the utensils, performed divinations, and pronounced prayers. During major sacrifices, one boy or man, preferably a son of the chief sacrificer, would act as a vessel for the spirit of the ancestors. This impersonator also needed to undergo purification before the rite. During the rite he would drink the wine offered to the ancestors and in trancelike fashion passively allow the spirits to animate him. A ritual expert would interpret the ancestors' wishes, which in the standard liturgy of the <i>I-Ii</i> was to convey blessings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_196_CnYuan*] NOTE: It seems more sensible, here, to exclude "major sacrifices" and only consider the simpler types of ancestor worship: it seems reasonable to infer that the latter occurred more frequently than the former. However, it would be quite easy to change a few key variables from "absent" to "present" should it be decided to incorporate the major sacrifices in this ritual--Cho-Yun and Linduff (1988), in particular, offer a detailed description of these rites.

On this occasion, the governors of provinces, and rulers of cities, and all who are in office or authority, send presents to the khan, of gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones, likewise of many white cloths of various kinds, and other white things, and many white horses. It is the custom of those who bring presents, if they can, to present nine times nine of every particular article, whether it be gold, or silver, cloths, or horses; and on this occasion, the khan sometimes receives 100,000 horses. On this grand festival, all the elephants belonging to the great khan, about 5000, are brought into the great court palace, covered with splendid housings of tapestry, wrought with the figures of various kinds of birds and beast, each of them bearing on their backs two chests filled with vessels of gold and silver; and many camels are paraded on the same occasion, covered over, with fine silken cloths, and loaded with other necessaries for the court. "On the morning of this festival of the new year, all the captains, barons, soldiers, physicians, astrologers, governors of provinces, generals of armies, and other officers of the great khan, assemble before the emperor, in the great hall of the palace, all placed in due order, according to their rank and dignity, and those who have no place or employment, stand without, that they may see the ceremonies. One of the heads of their priests then rises, and cries out with a loud voice, 'Bow down and adore,' on which all who are present bend down their foreheads to the earth. He then calls out aloud, 'God preserve our khan, and grant him long life and happiness;' and all the people answer, 'God grant this.' Then he says, 'May God increase and advance his empire, and preserve all his subjects, in peace, concord, and prosperity;' and the people say, 'God grant this our prayer.' All this is repeated four times. Then the chief priest goes forward to a red table or altar, richly adorned, on which the name of the khan is written; and taking a censer, containing rich spices and perfumes, he perfumes the altar or table with great reverence, in honour of the khan, and returns to his place in the assembly. After the conclusion of this ceremony, the various gifts which have been already mentioned are presented to the khan.

When additional information is given, this is usually restricted to one or two aspects of the ritual. I have, therefore, decided to combine these references to reconstruct an ideal type of the constituent elements of the blood covenant. It is composed of a number of different elements, namely: a sacrifice to one or more deities, the consumption of blood, and the making of a sworn statement. This statement set out the purpose of the covenant and contained a request for divine supervision; it also included a list of punishments which would befall transgressors." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_310_CnYuan*] The following is an "ideal type of the blood covenant as it was practised from the late Yuan until the twentieth century" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_311_CnYuan*]. "In a number of cases, we find the sacrifice of a horse and/or a cow. [...] Human blood was also used, always from the fingers of the participants (when the source was specified), as in the Daoist rituals referred to above. During the late Yuan five brothers bit their own fingers and let out blood, prior to swearing that they would die together with the man who had had one of them beaten up. In 1367 a local self-defense group from Songjiang prefecture in the Lower Yangzi region drank the blood from their fingers to cement their vows. This type of self-sacrifice further underlined the oath takers' seriousness of purpose. The participants' blood was not ritually mingled to create a Western style blood brotherhood, but rather used to empower the spoken or written words with a strong force of life. This is why either human or animal blood can be used, though animal blood is employed much more frequently. Our descriptions are often rather vague about the precise manner in which the blood from the sacrifice was used within the blood covenant ritual. The Chinese sources frequently use the term shaxue, which is traditionally interpreted as 'to smear blood.' [...] In the Daoist exorcist rituals discussed above, the blood was mixed with liquor and drunk (or put in the mouth and later spat out). [...] A brotherhood concluded during the late sixteenth century by local people in Fujian province was also accompanied explicitly by consuming (human or animal) blood. [...] In later periods, the oath was still often directed to Heaven and Earth as abstract deities. [...] In some instances, the blood covenant was concluded in the temple of the City God, who was the local representative of the Jade Emperor (popularly addressed as the Lord of Heaven), or the covenant was connected in some way to the cult of Guan Yu. [...] The principal task of the deities invoked in a (blood) covenant ritual was to enforce certain punishments if an agreement were not kept. Formal maledictions that spelled out these punishments were an essential part of the blood covenant and guaranteed that it would be kept. For unclear reasons, the sources on the blood covenant rarely mention the precise contents of these sanctions. Luckily, we possess much information on the maledictions that accompanied oral oaths of speaking the truth. The oldest detailed reference that I have found outside a Daoist ritual context stems from a long treatise on proper Pure Land practice, completed in circa 1305 by the famous Yuan monk Pudu (1255-1330). He notes with much disapproval that people took a formal vow to keep certain lay Buddhist precepts accompanied by strong and even violent maledictions, such as 'when I break the precepts I will willingly accept that evil illnesses envelop my body and that I fall in the underworld forever' or 'when I break the precepts, my left eye shall start to bleed and pus shall come out of my right eye.' [...] We find a whole range of sanctions, such as for instance terrible itches inflicted by red and white insects (in the Suzhou region), natural catastrophes, the plague, personal disasters or even the extinction of one's family, one's wife becoming a prostitute, and rebirth as a dog, horse or cow. [...] Such maledictions were not pronounced lightly. [...] The overall purpose of the oath itself could vary considerably, indicating that the blood covenant was an empty ritual form without preset contents. Judging from the way in which the blood covenant is mentioned in our sources, the aim of the agreement was usually a particular activity, which could be an outright rebellion, an act of resistance (such as the refusal to pay taxes or burning contracts), a shared religious expectation, etc. Participants did not need to become sworn brothers, and only in a few cases is the establishment of a sworn brotherhood given as the primary goal of the blood covenant. [...] In general, it seems that the blood covenant was not practised by members of social and intellectual elites or by women."

"In general, it seems that the blood covenant was not practised by members of social and intellectual elites or by women. Several reasons could be given for this fact, such as the use of blood and the rather gruesome imprecations (which would scare away members of the social elite and women for reasons of culturally prescribed sensibility), the oral character of the covenant (which might have excluded groups which ascribed a central role to written texts), and the highly public and emotional nature of the whole procedure (which would again have excluded women, as well as many men with a claim to some cultural refinement)."

While they carried out their ritual, a peddlar of lychees happened to drop by and witness the proceedings.

The actual functioning of both central and local government agencies reveals a great deal of overlap between civil and military jurisdictions. Such overlap, for which the Mongols were much criticized by Chinese scholar-officials, derived from the Mongols' traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_352_CnYuan*] "Of the six ministries, the Ministry of War was the least significant, as the real military authority in Yuan times resided in the Privy Council (Shu-mi yuan). The Privy Council, established in 1263, was at the pinnacle of a separate military bureaucracy, whereas the Ministry of War was subordinate to the Central Secretariat within the civilian bureaucracy. The insignificance of the Ministry of War is demonstrated by the fact that the Ping chih (Monograph on the military) in the Yuan shih (Official history of the Yuan) does not even mention the Ministry of War in its description of the structure of the Yuan military, instead stating that "the Privy Council was set up to take overall charge." All military offices, including the imperial guard (su-wei), were ultimately responsible to the Privy Council in the military chain of command.

Because civil service examinations, instituted only in 1313, did not provide a significant path for career advancement in the Yuan, many people with scholarly training, and some without, worked their way up through unranked or low-ranking positions in the clerical subbureaucracy to attain, at a relatively advanced age, a ranked, salaried position as a local official.This process was different from the Ch'ing dynasty process, in which private secretaries (mu-yu), often with advanced examination degrees, would remain as secretaries for long periods while awaiting a suitable opening in the Ch'ing bureaucracy. Unlike the Ch'ing mu-yu, Yuan clerks did not have examination degrees, and their advancement was subject to regularly sched- uled evaluations at intervals of thirty or forty months. For instance, after serving for thirty months as a county clerk (hsien ssu-li) and passing an evaluation, a person could be promoted to clerk in a prefecture or a subprefecture for another thirty-month term. If he passed that evaluation, he could be appointed clerk at the route level. A route clerk had to weather three more evaluations, or a total of ninety months, in that office before being considered for a position in the regular bureaucracy. Altogether, on the way to reaching a low-ranked position in the local government bureaucracy (i.e., a position not appreciably higher than the highest clerkship), a person who worked his way up would have spent twelve and a half years as a clerk. However, there was no guarantee of promotion after a thirty-month term; clerks were often transferred from one specialized domain (e.g., a granary clerk or jail clerk) to another at the same level. Contemporary critics of the Yuan government noted that clerks were transferred from local to central government posts and then back again without any great concern for continuity in such posts. Becoming even a county clerk was not automatic. At the age of fourteen or fifteen, a person would most likely begin as a lowly writer's assistant (t'ieh- shu) and could remain an unsalaried writer's assistant for ten years. Thus this person might attain the position of county clerk in his mid-twenties and, if he were lucky, the position of route clerk by the age of forty."

The Mongols favored certain groups who had surrendered early, particularly the UIGHURS, and preferred to employ potentially unreliable groups outside their own homelands. Ortoq merchants and non-Mongol overseers (DARUGHACHI) were usually either immigrants or local ethnic outgroups. Thus, in China they were Uighurs, Turkestani or Iranian Muslims, and Christians, while in Iran they were Uighurs, Assyrian Christians, Jews, or Turkestani Muslims. Foreigners from outside the empire entirely, such as the Polo family, were everywhere welcomed. Combined with the Mongol preference for Uighur scribes and for Buddhist clerics from KASHMIR or Tibet, the Mongols thus nurtured a distinctive multiethnic and parvenu ruling milieu that often aroused the deep disgust of the traditional landed upper class. In Iran Islamization dealt a strong but not fatal blow to this new milieu, but in China it lasted until the fall of the dynasty. In China Qubilai Khan codified this hierarchy of reliability by dividing the population into four classes: 1) Mongol; 2) SEMUREN (literally “various sorts”), a catchall term for western immigrants into China, especially Uighurs and Turkestani Muslims; 3) Han, including North Chinese, KITANS, Jurchens, and Koreans; and 4) southerners (nanren), including all subjects of the former Song Empire."

The Mongols kept captives from military campaigns, and many of these captive slaves (ch'ii-k'ou) and their families were allocated to soldiers for use in cultivating their lands, as Mongolian soldiers were loath to till the soil themselves. Many of the captive slaves were Chinese, and by the turn of the fourteenth century, so many of these captive slaves had run away that Mongolian military households became impoverished, and ironically, Mongolian men and women themselves began to be exported as slaves to India and Islamic countries, starting as early as the late thirteenth century."

Yet Khubilai khan could not abandon the Mongolian institution of the appanage with its attached serf and craftsmen households. The compromise was to appoint supervising administrators to the appanages and to grant annual payments from the revenues to the fief holders. That did not fully succeed in eliminating evasion and exploitation and other points of conflict with the central government. During Khubilai's long reign, about 15 percent of the population still was registered as attached households, and the concealed numbers may have been equally high.

Daoism, which honored the patriarch Laozi, offered naturalistic technologies such as charms, spells, and remedies to help them adapt to the physical conditions of the surrounding world. Geomancy— the siting of buildings in relation to the forces that flowed through the Earth’s surface— was one of their technologies. Buddhism provided a rich corpus of ideas and institutions that offered release from the attachments that caused suffering. It was also the religion that handled death, its monks and monasteries supplying ritual services to help the living assist the dead in navigating their passage through the Earth Prison.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Confucianism, a loose set of doctrines derived from the teachings of Confucius, proposed a different course. Confucians held that the path to goodness was more likely to be found by moral training and the effort of relating ethically to others than by going through the gods. During the Song, Confucianism had undergone an enhancement into what was known as the Teaching of the Way, which we now call NeoConfucianism. This enhancement had profound philosophical effects, some of which did not come fully to fruition until the Ming, but it had no real impact on the beliefs that guided ordinary people through their lives. For them, the Three Teachings were all they needed.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"After invading, the Mongols found themselves on a more complicated religious terrain than they were used to. Their religious orientation would best be described as shamanism. This led them to an interest in Tibetan Buddhism (Lamaism) more than in the Three Teachings, yet they feared the gods sufficiently to show respect toward any religious professional who could claim to have access to esoteric knowledge. Buddhist monks and Daoist priests competed for Mongol patronage, debating each other most famously in a grand court debate in 1258, but the regime declined to support one and suppress the other, so long as adherents of each could demonstrate the value of their teaching for bringing good fortune. 1 It may have been the effort of Chinese trying to explain the multiplicity of their traditions to the Mongols— or was it the Mongols trying to reflect their understanding back to their new subjects?—that encouraged the people of the Yuan to see an underlying unity in their systems of beliefs. The Three Teachings did not inhabit three separate categories, but rested within a single category. Sectarian adherents of the three different traditions still fought amongst themselves for state recognition and preferential treatment, but those who were less partisan in their beliefs felt free to engage eclectically, even erratically, with all the traditions.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The unity of the Three Teachings— the idea that China’s three main belief traditions were no more than different expressions of the same thing— is one of the two big ideas that shaped the landscape of belief during the Yuan and Ming dynasties."

That is to say, cosmologically Daoism sees women as expressions of the pure cosmic force of yin, necessary for the working of the universe, equal and for some schools even superior to yang. [...] However, Daoism throughout its history has lived and breathed the social vision of mainstream Confucian society, which was patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal, and saw women as inferior to men. Traditional Chinese culture relegated women to the inner quarters of the house and prevented them from participating in decision‐making and larger social issues (Ebrey 1993, 7‐8). In Confucian thinking only sons were valued, since they alone could continue the family line and fulfill the ancestral obligations. Girls, often not even counted among a man’s children, were commonly treated with disregard and contempt, consid‐ ered a burden since they would eventually marry out and continue someone else’s bloodline. They were not seen worthy of education, except in household skills, and their natural cycles rendered them impure and unsuitable for major responsibilities. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_503_CnYuan*].

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_561_CnYuan*] </i>The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

[...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_564_CnYuan*]  </i>The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_577_CnYuan*] </i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_578_CnYuan*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

The term goes back to the Bronze Age (and is not exclusive to Confucianism - indeed, virtually every Chinese ethical tradition had a concept of filial piety), but before Confucius it had referred to reverence for all ancestors, and mostly had to do with due sacrifice on their behalf. As with so many other moral and religious terms, Confucius and his followers radically reinterpreted it 5 to mean appropriate behaviour visà-vis one’s parents, and not only after their death. Merely providing sustenance was immediately disparaged as grotesquely inadequate: ‘Ziyou [i.e. the disciple Yan Yan, b. 506 bce] asked about filial piety. The Master said: “What is ‘filial’ nowadays refers to the ability to feed [one’s parents]. Even dogs and horses can be fed.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_599_CnYuan*] In Daoism: “From the very beginning of the written tradition of Taoism, there existed a close relation between it and Chinese military and practice. The ‘’Daode jing’’ contains passages that propounded ideas about the nature of warfare (that weapons are inauspicious implements; desolation follows an army) and the proper way for the ruler to engage in combat (conquer strength by manifesting weakness; do not value victory; do not attempt to dominate the world by force of arms) that were immensely influential in later times. [...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_600_CnYuan*] Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures.

The growth of cities in the late Sung and early Yuan periods had offered a fitting environment for the rise of the drama, for it provided the audience as well as the funds needed for performances. Without an urban culture and patronage from the government and private citizens, theater could not prosper. The Yuan cities did indeed support a great theater. At least 160 plays from that time have survived, and over 500 more were performed and written, though they are no longer extant. Districts with dozens of theaters sprouted in many of the cities. Actors and actresses, who had always previously been treated as social pariahs, found themselves in a more enviable position, at least during the early years of Mongolian rule. The Yuan dramas are described as "variety entertainments" because sketches - interspersed with songs, dances, and acrobatics - were characteristic of the genre, making it more accessible and more appealing to a popular audience. Professional playwrights as well as Chinese scholars, who were denied access to official posts because of the abolition of the civil service examinations, wrote the majority of the plays. Both Khubilai and the Mongolian court promoted the theater. They did so first by their lack of interference; playwrights could broach a variety of subjects without fear of government censorship. On a more positive note, Khubilai and his officials ordered the staging of a number of performances at court. They also appear to have served as patrons for a number of playwrights, and their espousal of the colloquial facilitated the task of the playwright and contributed to the development of Yuan theater.

In 1276 the ju-hu numbered only 3,890, a small enough group for the Mongols to waive certain of their state obligations. The number of scholarly households remained relatively low, in large part because this category of household was not hereditary; an incompetent scholar could lose his status. Much of the cultivated talent in Chinese society, for the reasons that have been indicated, was forced to find avenues for less-than-ideal expression, mostly apart from government and at humble levels of society.
