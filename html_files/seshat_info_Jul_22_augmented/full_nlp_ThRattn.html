In 1782, what remained of the old Ayutthaya aristocracy staged a coup and put their leader on the throne. This leader took the name of Rama I Chakri and moved the capital to Bangkok, known at the time as Rattanakosin or Krungthep.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ThRattn] Under Rama I, the kingdom rapidly expanded to the south (where it extended its control to the Malay peninsula), the north (where Chiang Mai became a new tributary), and the east (taking control of Vientiane and much of Cambodia).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ThRattn] It could be said to have reached its peak between 1793 and 1810, when it found new stability, regained control over important Asian trade networks, and witnessed a literary florescence, with the translation of several classics from different Asian languages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ThRattn] Our 'ThRattn' polity spans the 89 years between 1782 and 1873, when Rama V began a comprehensive series of modernizing reforms.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ThRattn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Rattanakosin kingdom was ruled by the Thai aristocracy. The king was simply a <i>primus inter pares</i> ‒ indeed, some kings, such as Rama II and Rama IV, actually retreated into a ritual role and left the administration of the kingdom entirely to the nobility. Even during the reign of more active kings, such as Rama I and Rama III, the aristocracy still monopolized the key posts in the central administration.  However, the king always led the country in spiritual matters: he was seen as a <i>bodhisattva</i>, a spiritually superior superhuman being tasked with preserving Buddhism and aiding his subjects in their ascent toward <i>nirvana</i>, for example through moral laws banning sinful pursuits.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ThRattn][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Evidence for the size of this polity's population before 1911, the year of the first census, is sparse and unreliable. However, a reasonable estimate would be that, following slow growth beginning in the 1780s, the population reached just below 5 million by the middle of the 19th century.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ThRattn] It is not clear whether this estimate includes tributary states and cities.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=ThRattn&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 513,120 ♥</b> in squared kilometers.

"Evidence for the size and distribution of the population before the first census in 1911 is sparse and far from reliable. Estimates for the 1800-20 period vary from 1 to 3 million (Skinner, 1957:79; Sternstein, 1993:18). A detailed examination of the evidence by Sternstein (1965:1984) suggests very gradual growth from the 1780s to reach a population a little short of 5 million by the middle of the nineteenth century."

"We know that in 1782, there was already some settlement on both banks of the river.

Terwiel's work suggests that at the Bowring Treaty (1855) Bangkok's population may have reached around 50,000-100,000.

In actuality, members of the nobility through ad hoc appointments led Southeast Asian armies. These men were usually personal favorites of the ruler or one of his relatives, or were outlying lords obligated to bring local levies to participate in campaigns. One reason for this was the concern that otherwise a regular officer class on a permanent footing would become part of the court and ministerial politics that plagued early modern Southeast Asian states."

These operators were also charged with the maintenance of order, and with the settlement of all problems regarding counterfeit money and the falsification of gambling chips. As in the situation in nineteenth-century China, the gambling houses in Siam were also supposed to open only during the New Year period. The reality may have been different, since visitors to nineteenth-century Bangkok found many such establishments open for business at all times. The Chinese Khun Phatthanasombat supervised not only gambling activities, but also transactions in drinks, and obviously other forms of recreation for the leisured and the rich.

nineteenth-century that "the people believe that in order to make merit during this life to save themselves from misery in some future existence, they must among other things follow 'the religion which teaches alms-giving.' 'Make merit.' That is the sum and substance of their religious faith and worship. As every reader of Buddhism knows, the soul is said to pass through many stages of existence before it reaches the mysterious region of Nirvana, and that it is possible for any soul to pass even beyond the shadowy confines of this debatable territory and finally attain the perfect condition of Buddhahood. At death, the merit and demerit of the soul are balanced, and the next condition of the wandering soul determined according to a system of debit and credit. The wicked king may be re-born as a slave or even pass into the body of a toad. The soul of a slave may be re-born in one of royal degree or may even ascend to an habitation in the celestial spheres. Hence it behoves every living being during this life upon earth to make as much merit as it possibly can, and as the custom of alms-giving is held to be a very profitable method of investment for the future, it is widely practised by king". More specifically, "One of the commonest sights in any part of Siam is the procession of priests, soon after sunrise, seeking their daily bread. They carry a bowl, basin or bag, and go straight on from house to house, each in the district appointed him. They stand outside the houses, but make no request for alms. If anything is given to them they bless the giver; if they receive nothing they pass silently on their way. Having collected their food, they return to the monastery to eat, and to meditate meanwhile upon the perishableness of the body." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_192_ThRattn] Almsgiving is a sufficiently simple ritual that contemporary descriptions may well broadly correspond to how it was carried out in the past as well: starting 6 a.m. every morning in modern-day Thailand,  "[m]onks walk at a steady pace, in line and in order of seniority, their bowls held in front of them or just below waist level, and their eyes on the road or path a few steps ahead of them. A monk carries his bowl in a cloth sling, whereas a novice does not use a sling but carries the bowl in both hands in front of him. While walking, a monk is not supposed to be anticipating the food he will be offered, but reflecting on the essentials of the monastic life: the robes, the <i>kuti</i> or other shelter, medicine, and the alms bowl which is his means of obtaining food to support his life rather than for pleasurable consumption" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_193_ThRattn].

It is a small green lawn situated opposite to a very large temple, and on the edge of a very busy thoroughfare. For three hundred and sixty three days in each year, there is nothing, except the huge pillars of the swing, to draw one's attention to the spot. A few boys playing football or flying kites, a few old women squatting down for a little gossip, or a few Malay grooms with their masters' ponies are the usual everyday occupants of the spot. On the other two days of the year, when the harvest festival is held, every inch of available space is occupied. The native children, unable to see over the heads of the men and women when they are upon the ground, quickly mount the neighbouring walls, and perch themselves in the branches of the trees, or cling, like monkeys, to every lamp-post and telegraph pole within sight of the proceedings. The thoroughfares leading to the place are blocked with innumerable carriages and rickshaws. The crowd is an exceedingly good-tempered one, and brawling of any kind is very unusual. The distant sound of a military band heralds the approach of another of those processions so dear to the heart of the Siamese. The procession passes through the dense crowd without any trouble, for the people willingly fall back so as not to impede its progress. Strangely coloured banners bearing quaint devices, flutter above the heads of the crowd. A modern military band plays 'Marching through Georgia', while an ancient band in tattered vermilion garments with yellow trimmings, bangs curious drums, and pierces the air with the penetrating shrieks of long brass trumpets. The tom-tom and the gong join in the general uproar. The crowd sways to and fro, striving to catch a glimpse of the barefooted soldiers in their brilliant uniforms, or of the numerous articles borne in the procession to indicate the nature and meaning of the festivities. Decorated buffaloes dragging decorated carts, bundles of rice, offerings of fruit and flowers, are all evidences of the thankfulness of the people for the safe ingathering of their harvests. "In the centre of the procession, carried in a chair of state on the shoulders of a number of strong well-built men, and shielded from the sun by a huge state umbrella, sits the Master of the Ceremonies resplendent in cloth of gold and jewelled ornaments. At one time the Minister for Agriculture officiated on these occasions, but now a different nobleman is selected each year, whose business it is to organise and superintend all the arrangements for the festival. All eyes turn towards the seated figure in his tall conical hat and jewelled robes. He is carried to a small brick platform, which is draped with the national flag and covered with flowers. He takes his seat, with two Brahmin priests on his right hand and two on his left. He places his right foot on his left knee, the left foot resting upon the ground. After having once seated himself in this position he is not allowed to remove his foot off his knee until the whole ceremony is finished. As this lasts about two hours, the presiding nobleman must be fairly uncomfortable by the time it is over. The penalty for moving the foot was, formerly, the confiscation of the culprit's property and the loss of his rank, in addition to any immediate ill-usage the attendant priests might think fit to bestow upon him; but this is now all done away with, and the only deterrent influence brought to bear upon the temporary sufferer is the opinion of the people, who would feel deeply hurt and disappointed should any detail of their well-beloved ceremony be omitted. "The attention of the crowd is next directed to the performance of the swinging games. The swing itself is like any ordinary child's swing except for its enormous size. The side pillars are about ninety feet high, and the seat of the swing is about half-way between the ornamented cross-bar and the ground. A few feet in front of the seat, on the side towards the Palace, a long bamboo-stem is fixed in the ground, and from the top is suspended a small bag of silver coins. The men who take part in the games are usually Brahmins. They are dressed in white, and wear conical hats. They swing towards the bag of money and endeavour to catch it with their teeth. There are generally three competitors; the prizes for the first being worth about fifteen shillings, while for the second and third they are worth about ten and five shillings respectively. When the winners have received their rewards they pass amongst the crowd, sprinkling the spectators with consecrated water contained in bullocks' horns. Soon afterwards the Minister returns to his home, the crowd disperses, and thus this very ancient ceremony is brought to a close."

"The rites take place with great splendour twice yearly, on the third day of the waxing of the fifth month (Chaitra), and on the thirteenth day of the waning of the tenth month (Bhadrapada). The Drinking of the Water takes place in the Chapel Royal in Bangkok, and also in one temple in each seat of provincial government. The water is previously hallowed in the usual way by the monks, who recite mantras, the sacred sincana thread being stretched round the water-vessels, while the Court Brahmans also dip into the water the State Sword and other royal weapons, this being a rite of contagious magic, by the power of which any official meditating treason would be destroyed. It is said that persons have not infrequently in the past died of cholera after drinking the hallowed water, a result which no doubt did much to strengthen the general belief in the efficacy of the magic. On the day of the ceremony a Brahman reads out the Oath, and each official must drink the contents of a small cup, which he must drain to the last drop. Any appearance of difficulty in swallowing was, in the old days, considered as equivalent to an admission of disloyalty. The ladies of the palace, as well as members of the royal family, drink the Water of Allegiance, but, of course, with suitable privacy. Officials confined to their houses through illness are not excused from drinking the Water, but it is taken to their bedsides by royal pages or other officials." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_316_ThRattn] The Oath of Allegiance is too long to be included here, but it involves asking supernatural forces to punish the participants very thoroughly were they to fail their king: "may [the gods] plague us with evil, destroy our lives, effect our destruction and death by breakage, by severance; cause our death by lightning and thunderbolts, by royal weapons, the powerful royal sword, by poison and the power of land and water animals; let there be some opportunity for the destruction of the perfidious ones; let swift destruction come; let us not escape all great disasters and consequences of all localities, which those who have the power can inflict for all offences. We beseech the power of the deities to plague with poisonous boils, rapidly fatal, and all manner of diseases the dishonourable, perverse, and treacherous, plague with untimely, wretched and appalling deaths, manifest to the eyes of the world; when we shall have departed this life from earth, cause us to be sent and all to be born in the great hell, where we shall burn with quenchless fire for tens and hundreds of thousands of ages and limitless transmigrations; and when we have expiated our penalty there, and are again born in any world, we pray we may fail to find the least happiness in worlds of pleasurable enjoyments; let us not meet the god Buddha, the sacred teachings, the sacred priests, who come to be gracious to animals, helping them escape misery, reach heaven and attain a cessation of births and deaths; should we meet them let them grant us no gracious assistance."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_414_ThRattn] Since the 14th century CE Thai women had only functions not rights, expressed in the popular aphorism: 'Women are buffaloes. Men are humans’. Women toiled in the fields and in market places but had no social status. There was no spiritual path open for them through Buddhism either - ordained nuns did not appear until the early 20th century. Husbands had full legal authority over their future. Daughters of higher status households were married off to hold down elite contacts. Very high-status women were confined to the king’s Inner Palace, keeping them away from public life. The 1804 CE 'Laws of the Three Seals' sanctioned polygamy, widely practiced among the aristocracy, especially state officials. It classified wives into three sorts: major (wives from parental arrangement - Mea Klang Muang), minor (wives of her request - Mea Klang Nork) and slave wives. Towards the end of the period women’s literacy increased and a few women entered a school built in 1868 CE to train the civil service, and the first all-girls school dates to 1874 CE.

The status of slave seems at times to have had an attraction for <i>phrai</i>, especially for <i>phrai luang</i>. Moreover, although the Thai did distinguish the <i>phrai</i> from the slaves, in their ranking system they intermixed <i>phrai</i> with slaves, since the paupers were <i>phrai</i>. Finally, the nature of the tasks given to the slaves did not differ from those performed by the <i>phrai</i>, since both would help around the house, work in the fields, perhaps do some marketing, and serve as retainers and parts of the noble's retinue. At the most there is a quantitative not a qualitative difference in the labor and other services which could be demanded, which appears clearly in the distinction of the amount of work which could be demanded from phrai as contrasted with slaves (see above, p. 326)."

Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_458_ThRattn] The same probably applied to Thailand, where, by "1361, the 'Law of Husbands and Wives' allowed men to practice polygamy" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_459_ThRattn].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_460_ThRattn] “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_461_ThRattn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> “Living a morally good life thus always brings a twofold benefit: Others are aided and one’s own spiritual development or karmic disposition is positively affected.

[...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action- strong greed, hatred, and delusion -lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_497_ThRattn] “‘Right action’ basically means to act gently and kindly and to be ‘compassionate to all living beings’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_499_ThRattn] “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_500_ThRattn]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another.
