[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_GrCrPre] The size of these sites is about 2 ha aside Knossos where a settlement of 5 ha already existed since the Final Neolithic period. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_GrCrPre] This settled scape is characterized by a considerable degree of regionalism which is expressed in material culture and social practices. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_GrCrPre] From the Early Minoan II onwards (2700-2200 BCE), the importance of coastal sites considerably increased while many inland sites seems to be abandoned. Monumental constructions appeared for the first time at Knossos, Malia, Phaistos, Tylissos, and Palaikastro. Many sites were destroyed or burned at the end of the period and this has been interpreted as the outcome of conflict between different social groups aspiring to political and economic power. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_GrCrPre] <b>2200-1900 BCE</b>: Settlement hierarchy change: nucleated villages seems less important and there is a new emphasis on mountain zones. Knossos, Malia and Phaistos increased considerably and become centers of a significant importance. The central monumental construction suggest the presence of a authority controlling the surrounding hinterland.  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_GrCrPre] These large centers and their supporting surrounding regions each form complex social, political and economic landscapes, in which larger regional-scale integrations could occur.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_GrCrPre] Administrative systems, however, were less sophisticated that these adopted in Mainland Greece during the Early Helladic period (2700-2000 BCE).

Starting in the EM I period, [3100-2700 BCE] the Minoans of south central Crete built tholos tombs, and in the EM II period, rectangular house tombs appear in north central and east Crete (Branigan 1970, 1988; Soles 1992). In the EM II period, [2700-2200 BCE] rooms located either within the tombs or before their entrances were used for ritual activities that were not associated with rites performed for the dead. Several rites had niches, altars, bench shrines, and paved courtyards. The fact that the rituals performed at the tombs were being taken beyond simple funerary rites is indicated by some of their finds (Branigan 1998, 22; Soles 1992, 226-36), which include offering tables, triton wheels, clay phalli, cups with molded breasts, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines and rhyta, some in the form of bulls, and bronze double axes. Branigan (1993, 133) suggests that bulls and perhaps bull sacrifices were part of the ceremonies. Certainly the cult was concerned with human fertility and the seasonal cycle. A series of female figurines who either carried a vessel or whose breasts were pierced so that they could functioned as rhyta supports the idea that fertility was a major concern of early Minoan cult. One figurine from Koumasa, ca. 2000 BC, has a snake wound around her shoulders and may be an early Snake Goddess (Gesell 1983). These figurines were found not only in the tombs but also in caves and at the settlement shrine of Mystos (Warren 1972)."

It remains the earliest Minoan Shrine, demonstrating that the household or domestic cult of a or the Minoan goddess was in existence before the Minoan palaces were founded. Offering of liquids certainly and foodstuffs probably made in jars and containers, focussing on the bench altar with its statuette of the divinity. The miniature jug she holds confirms her concern with liquids, wine, oil or water. When she is seen with her contemporary counterpart from a tomb at Koumasa, this figure having the additional attribute of a snake, it is apparent that major religious elements which are to persist throughout the Minoan period, and later,as Nilsson showed, are present at least as early as the pre-palatial, proto-urban villages of Crete. Our figures from Myrtos reopens the question whether the Minoans had cult statues of divinities before the Late Minoan III or post-palatial period."

During the Prepalatial period, the practice of group burial was adopted, in vaulted structures or burial buildings imitating houses, or in burial caves. This practice survived, to a greater or lesser extent, throughout the Minoan era. The dead, who probably belonged to the same kinship group, were placed in successive burial layers along with precious personal items, sometimes high-status objects, and ritual vessels containing offerings, indicating afterlife beliefs. From time to time, offerings to the dead were made with incense, and the bones of older burials were moved aside to make way for new ones. Gradually the practice appeared of placing the dead in clay larnakes (sarcophagi) inside the communal tombs, while particular attention was given to the cult of the dead, who were identified with the sacred ancestors of the community. Three-dimensional clay groups of figurines depicting a circle dance in honour of the dead, offerings made by relatives at altars in front of the dead ancestors, and kneading bread for the ritual offerings to the dead, hint at the extent of the mortuary practices used in the cemeteries.  Incorporated into the daily life of local communities, the vaulted-tomb cemeteries continued in use during the following periods of the Old and New Palaces, as gathering-places during burial ceremonies and commemorative rites. Paved courts, sacred enclosures, altar-like structures, eating and drinking vessels for funerary banquets, all make up the landscape of death and reveal the burial practices that survived unchanged until the end of the Minoan era. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_38_GrCrPre] "Prepalatial and Protopalatial Crete is characterised by a remarkable persistence of extramural collective burial grounds (of which the tholos tombs12 and house tombs13 are the most conspicuous examples) where secondary burial was universally practised. To date no Prepalatial or Protopatial primary burial has been securely identified. From the longevity of tomb use and the presence of disarticulated human bones in quantities, it is assumed that a good proportion of the population received an archaeologically visible burial in long used family or clan-based tombs, but this assumption needs to be confirmed or rejected by the publication of relevant osteological assemblages. The visual encounter with a mass of disarticulated bodies in the confined space of above-ground built tombs, or rock shelters or caves, must have been striking for the small communities of the period, regardless of whether they were considered ancestors or not, following John Barrett or James Whitley respectively. Sevi Triantaphyllou's work on the human bones from Archanes Tholos Gamma and Moni Odigitria has demonstrated for the first time that the complete decomposition of the body's soft parts was not a necessary prerequisite for the performance of secondary burial. This practice confirms the transient nature of the individual after burial, in contrast to the likely emphasis on staging snapshot identities (through assorted material culture) during primary burial. While evidence for fumigation (charred bones and fire discolouration on walls, deposition of a limestone or soil layer) is convincing, proposals for the manipulation of select bones (through chopping and grinding) should await a supporting osteological study. There is however clear evidence for the curation of the accumulated bones with an emphasis on skulls and long bones, disposed in specially built structures or natural formations, recently confirmed by the exclusive use of the Ayios Charalambos cave for secondary burial." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_39_GrCrPre] "In Minoan times, however, there seems to have been a collective exhumation, attested by the storing and sorting out of skulls and femurs of several individuals. I therefore suspect that this periodical cleansing of the graves was also an occasion of communal gathering around the tombs for the practice of death cult.//If a feast was a feature accompanying the rites of exhumation, it is reasonable to assume that availability of resources may have been a crucial factor in determining the calendrical date of the gathering.//[...] Concepts such as feast, celebration, and summoning of crowds from afar seem to fit the Minoan picture particularly well. Animal bones and dozens of conical cups testify to feasting, whereas the paved areas outside the tombs point to gatherings of sizable crowds. If then we can assume a large feast for the Minoan rites of secondary burial, a time of year coinciding with harvest is a very plausible one. In that case celebrations of death and life would seem once more to coincide."

During the Prepalatial period, the practice of group burial was adopted, in vaulted structures or burial buildings imitating houses, or in burial caves. This practice survived, to a greater or lesser extent, throughout the Minoan era. The dead, who probably belonged to the same kinship group, were placed in successive burial layers along with precious personal items, sometimes high-status objects, and ritual vessels containing offerings, indicating afterlife beliefs. From time to time, offerings to the dead were made with incense, and the bones of older burials were moved aside to make way for new ones. Gradually the practice appeared of placing the dead in clay larnakes (sarcophagi) inside the communal tombs, while particular attention was given to the cult of the dead, who were identified with the sacred ancestors of the community. Three-dimensional clay groups of figurines depicting a circle dance in honour of the dead, offerings made by relatives at altars in front of the dead ancestors, and kneading bread for the ritual offerings to the dead, hint at the extent of the mortuary practices used in the cemeteries.  Incorporated into the daily life of local communities, the vaulted-tomb cemeteries continued in use during the following periods of the Old and New Palaces, as gathering-places during burial ceremonies and commemorative rites. Paved courts, sacred enclosures, altar-like structures, eating and drinking vessels for funerary banquets, all make up the landscape of death and reveal the burial practices that survived unchanged until the end of the Minoan era. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_64_GrCrPre] "Prepalatial and Protopalatial Crete is characterised by a remarkable persistence of extramural collective burial grounds (of which the tholos tombs12 and house tombs13 are the most conspicuous examples) where secondary burial was universally practised. To date no Prepalatial or Protopatial primary burial has been securely identified. From the longevity of tomb use and the presence of disarticulated human bones in quantities, it is assumed that a good proportion of the population received an archaeologically visible burial in long used family or clan-based tombs, but this assumption needs to be confirmed or rejected by the publication of relevant osteological assemblages. The visual encounter with a mass of disarticulated bodies in the confined space of above-ground built tombs, or rock shelters or caves, must have been striking for the small communities of the period, regardless of whether they were considered ancestors or not, following John Barrett or James Whitley respectively. Sevi Triantaphyllou's work on the human bones from Archanes Tholos Gamma and Moni Odigitria has demonstrated for the first time that the complete decomposition of the body's soft parts was not a necessary prerequisite for the performance of secondary burial. This practice confirms the transient nature of the individual after burial, in contrast to the likely emphasis on staging snapshot identities (through assorted material culture) during primary burial. While evidence for fumigation (charred bones and fire discolouration on walls, deposition of a limestone or soil layer) is convincing, proposals for the manipulation of select bones (through chopping and grinding) should await a supporting osteological study. There is however clear evidence for the curation of the accumulated bones with an emphasis on skulls and long bones, disposed in specially built structures or natural formations, recently confirmed by the exclusive use of the Ayios Charalambos cave for secondary burial." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_65_GrCrPre] "In Minoan times, however, there seems to have been a collective exhumation, attested by the storing and sorting out of skulls and femurs of several individuals.

During the Prepalatial period, the practice of group burial was adopted, in vaulted structures or burial buildings imitating houses, or in burial caves. This practice survived, to a greater or lesser extent, throughout the Minoan era. The dead, who probably belonged to the same kinship group, were placed in successive burial layers along with precious personal items, sometimes high-status objects, and ritual vessels containing offerings, indicating afterlife beliefs. From time to time, offerings to the dead were made with incense, and the bones of older burials were moved aside to make way for new ones. Gradually the practice appeared of placing the dead in clay larnakes (sarcophagi) inside the communal tombs, while particular attention was given to the cult of the dead, who were identified with the sacred ancestors of the community. Three-dimensional clay groups of figurines depicting a circle dance in honour of the dead, offerings made by relatives at altars in front of the dead ancestors, and kneading bread for the ritual offerings to the dead, hint at the extent of the mortuary practices used in the cemeteries.  Incorporated into the daily life of local communities, the vaulted-tomb cemeteries continued in use during the following periods of the Old and New Palaces, as gathering-places during burial ceremonies and commemorative rites. Paved courts, sacred enclosures, altar-like structures, eating and drinking vessels for funerary banquets, all make up the landscape of death and reveal the burial practices that survived unchanged until the end of the Minoan era. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_122_GrCrPre] "Prepalatial and Protopalatial Crete is characterised by a remarkable persistence of extramural collective burial grounds (of which the tholos tombs12 and house tombs13 are the most conspicuous examples) where secondary burial was universally practised. To date no Prepalatial or Protopatial primary burial has been securely identified. From the longevity of tomb use and the presence of disarticulated human bones in quantities, it is assumed that a good proportion of the population received an archaeologically visible burial in long used family or clan-based tombs, but this assumption needs to be confirmed or rejected by the publication of relevant osteological assemblages. The visual encounter with a mass of disarticulated bodies in the confined space of above-ground built tombs, or rock shelters or caves, must have been striking for the small communities of the period, regardless of whether they were considered ancestors or not, following John Barrett or James Whitley respectively. Sevi Triantaphyllou's work on the human bones from Archanes Tholos Gamma and Moni Odigitria has demonstrated for the first time that the complete decomposition of the body's soft parts was not a necessary prerequisite for the performance of secondary burial. This practice confirms the transient nature of the individual after burial, in contrast to the likely emphasis on staging snapshot identities (through assorted material culture) during primary burial. While evidence for fumigation (charred bones and fire discolouration on walls, deposition of a limestone or soil layer) is convincing, proposals for the manipulation of select bones (through chopping and grinding) should await a supporting osteological study. There is however clear evidence for the curation of the accumulated bones with an emphasis on skulls and long bones, disposed in specially built structures or natural formations, recently confirmed by the exclusive use of the Ayios Charalambos cave for secondary burial." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_GrCrPre] "In Minoan times, however, there seems to have been a collective exhumation, attested by the storing and sorting out of skulls and femurs of several individuals. I therefore suspect that this periodical cleansing of the graves was also an occasion of communal gathering around the tombs for the practice of death cult.//If a feast was a feature accompanying the rites of exhumation, it is reasonable to assume that availability of resources may have been a crucial factor in determining the calendrical date of the gathering.//[...] Concepts such as feast, celebration, and summoning of crowds from afar seem to fit the Minoan picture particularly well. Animal bones and dozens of conical cups testify to feasting, whereas the paved areas outside the tombs point to gatherings of sizable crowds. If then we can assume a large feast for the Minoan rites of secondary burial, a time of year coinciding with harvest is a very plausible one. In that case celebrations of death and life would seem once more to coincide."

Funerary rituals "involved a significant number of people, as suggested by the new architectural features and large ceramic deposits. The spatially more complex cemeteries led to a more organized and controlled participation by individuals in ritual actives. These rituals, however, need not necessarily have involved an entire community. The diversity of spaces, some of then closed, some open, some large, some small, suggest a complex variety of rituals, some of which could have involved a restricted number of people, while others included a larger group. Communal and group activity, therefore, could have consisted of a combination of rituals in which the whole community was involved, perhaps in consumption, and ceremonies that involved only a small group in some of the interior spaces. Both types of ritual may have complemented each other, simply marking different moments in a long funeral process that activated several complex and subtle intra- and inter community dynamics."  ..."It is suggested here that the new interest in the mobilization and control of people in the cemetery was related to two different dynamics, the reinforcement of the identity and regional position of the community (horizontal), and the efforts of certain individuals to acquire privileged social status (vertical).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_128_GrCrPre]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (participants) ♣ whole polity ♥</b> It appears that secondary burial was practiced by most Cretans [MAJIDBENAM_REF_129_GrCrPre].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (audience) ♣ whole polity ♥</b> It appears that secondary burial was practiced by most Cretans [MAJIDBENAM_REF_130_GrCrPre].[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Dysphoric elements</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fasting ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "Alongside these food offerings there is also good evidence for drinking and feasting at tombs by the living members of the community.
