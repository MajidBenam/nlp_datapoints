The armor found in the grove mounds of prior to 400 B.C. is made by riveting together small pieces of iron to make helmets and cuirasses. Some of the latter give quite the effect of plate armor but are built up of small pieces. By the 10th century, the earliest time of which we have definite knowledge, it had assumed a characteristic form which it retained until armor was abandoned in the middle of the 19th century. A Japanese suit, fig. 78, consists of a helmet, kabuto, usually made of a large number of narrow plates riveted together with raised edges at the joints. It has a small peak, maizashi, in front and a wide neck guard, shikoro, made of strips of steel or of scales of leather or steel laced together with heavy silk or leather cords. One or more of these pieces is turned back in front to form ear guards, fukigayeshi. The front is usually decorated with two horn-like pieces, kuwagata, representing the leaves of a water plant; between them is an ornament, maidate, corresponding to the European crest. The face is covered by a steel mask, menpo, to which a laminated neck guard, yodare-kake, is attached. There are five varieties of menpo - covering the entire face - all of the face below the eyes - the forehead and cheeks only - and two for the cheeks and chin only. Of these, the second is much most used. A gorget, nodowa, was sometimes worn but was not considered as a regular part of the suit. The body was enclosed in a corselet, do, made of plates or strips laced together with silk or leather cords. It either opened at the side, do-maru, or at the back haramaki-do. Attached to it were shoulder pieces, watagami, from which it hung. The taces, kusazuri, made of strips laced together, hung from the do.

Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more popular than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." <sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup> For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson <sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-138">[138]</a></sup>, that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai. Although it is a Shinto concept, it was popularized by Buddhism during the Heian period [...]" <sup id="cite_ref-139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ seasonally ♥</b> According to Picken, all modern-day shrines host a matsuri on the following occasions: Oshogatsu (New Year), Setsubun-sai (a Spring festival inspired by Chinese traditions), Haru Matsuri (Spring Festival), Natsu Matsuri (Summer Festival), and Aki Matsuri (Autumn Festival).

Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. ANOTHER NOTE: It is unusual for the most widespread ritual to also be the largest ritual, as well as the most euphoric one. However, it does seem that the matsuri was the principal <i>collective</i> Shinto ritual. As for activities that could be considered "rituals" but aren't strictly religious in nature--such as the tea ceremony and communal bathing--they are usually exclusive to, or performed significantly more frequently by the upper classes. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." <sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup> For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson <sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup>, that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai.

[...] It must be added, however, that few of the ‘old rituals’ survived intact after the Meiji government’s radical revamping and restructuring of Shinto so that it could serve as a national creed (see Hardacre 1989)." <sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup> "In large shrines, the routine and rituals of the day are fixed throughout the year; whether or not visitors come to the shrine, these are followed. [...] At [8 a.m. every morning] the act of morning worship (<i>cho-hai</i>) takes place, involving all the shrine priests and staff. The <i>norito</i> is recited, the staff purified for the day, and announcements made about the day's events and duties." <sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup> "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami." <sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "At [8 a.m. every morning] the act of morning worship (<i>cho-hai</i>) takes place, involving all the shrine priests and staff." <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> "At [8 a.m. every morning] the act of morning worship (<i>cho-hai</i>) takes place, involving all the shrine priests and staff." <sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> What is the typical number of priests at a large shinto shrine?</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "Historically,the office of shrine priest was typically passed down through a priestly family from father to son." <sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (participants) ♣ elites ♥</b> "In large shrines, the routine and rituals of the day are fixed throughout the year; whether or not visitors come to the shrine, these are followed.

Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." <sup id="cite_ref-264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-264">[264]</a></sup> For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson <sup id="cite_ref-265" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-265">[265]</a></sup>, that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai.

[...] According to custom, the heads of respectable samurai were cleaned and the hair combed before being examined. The cleaning of the decapitated heads sometimes fell to samurai women. A rare eyewitness account, recorded by the daughter of a samurai living in the castle during a battle, yields a description of this repugnant operation. The young girl, later known as Oan, the daughter of the respectable samurai Yamada Kyoreki, experienced the horror of sleeping beside a collection of severed heads in the Ogaki Castle of Mino during the great Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Although Oan’s experience was written down in a much later period, I cite from it because samurai women’s memoirs detailing the practice of wars are so uncommon: ‘My mother and I, as well as the wives and daughters of the other retainers, were in the tenshu [the highest building in the castle] casting bullets. Severed heads taken by our allies were also gathered up in this area of the castle. We attached a tag to each head in order to identify them properly. Then we repeatedly blackened their teeth. Why did we do that? A long time ago, blackened teeth were admired as the sign of a distinguished man. So, we were asked to apply a generous coat of ohaguro [a black dental dye] to any heads with white teeth. [Tooth-dyeing, a popular practice among the ladies of the court in the Heian period, was also affected by male aristocrats and warriors from the late Heian through the Muromachi periods.] Even these severed heads no longer held any terror for me. I used to sleep enveloped by the bloody odor of those old heads.’ [...] Here it is important to note that, even in the face of imminent defeat, the cosmetic beautifictation of the heads was regularly carried out. This act of cleaning the heads was in part a sign of respect for fallen warriors. More to the point, it represented a tribute to the victors’ honorific pride as men who could defeat heroic enemies. And the tangible proof of one’s prowess, in the form of a pile of severed heads, would certainly result in better rewards from one’s lord.” <sup id="cite_ref-309" class="reference"><a

Simply put, anyone owing ultimate allegiance to the imperial court at Kyoto was Japanese; everyone else was a ‘barbarian’. Thus merchants, adventurers and exiles in southern Hokkaido were called ‘crossing-party barbarians’ (‘’watarito Ezo’’), despite their Japanese origins. Conversely, many former ‘barbarians’ became loyal, tax-paying imperial subjects; after a transitional period as imperial ‘captives’ (‘’fushu’’) the erstwhile ‘barbarians’ blended anonymously into Japanese society.” <sup id="cite_ref-377" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-377">[377]</a></sup> This fits with the Shinto notion that the "origins of the gods are at once the origins of the Japanese islands and the Japanese people" and therefore "Japan is a sacred land" <sup id="cite_ref-378" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-378">[378]</a></sup>. At the same time, Buddhism teaches to cultivate equanimity towards all, including enemies <sup id="cite_ref-379" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-379">[379]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ uncertain_present_absent ♥</b> Mostly absent, Pure Land Buddhism being the main exception. In Shinto: “From earliest times, the role of female shamans in Shinto rites is apparent. An incident recorded in the Wei Dynasty records refers to a civil war that was ended when a 13-year-old girl called Himiko was made empress. While this may have been an incident in the kingdom of Yamatai , women empresses both reigned and ruled, especially Empress Jingū (reigned 201- 269) until Empress Kōken (reigned 749- 758) became involved with the would-be usurper Buddhist monk Dōkyō (died 722), after which the office was closed to women.//In spite of Western feminist attacks on the alleged male chauvinism of Japanese society, women in fact have served as priests ( kannushi ), imperial representatives, and in many other offices. Even Japanese Christianity ordained women clergy at least half a century before ordination of women began in a few traditions in Europe and the United States.//Restrictions on women have to do primarily with issues such as menstruation or childbirth, where blood may be found. Blood may be related to new life, but it also may link with death, and therefore creates impurity ( tsumi ) that must be removed by purification ( harai ). This is not a gender issue in the Western sense. The issue is any of the items that create impurity. [...] In spite of some feminist arguments coming from within Japan that Shinto is discriminatory in certain respects, taking into consideration of role of early empresses who practiced shamanism , and the number of women who in later periods led religious movements, especially among the New Religions . Shinto in its history, on the whole, seems to have been relatively open-minded toward women. The position and influence of women seems first to have been challenged and changed with the arrival of the highly male-centered and patriarchal culture of Buddhism from the Asian mainland to an extent that has not yet been fully realized or admitted by many scholars of Buddhism.” <sup id="cite_ref-380" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-380">[380]</a></sup> In Buddhism: “The attitude of male-dominated Japanese Buddhism has varied in its perspectives on women and the kind of religious lives and roles women were capable of assuming. Sometimes this view was negative toward women, and other times it was significantly more positive. Both Tendai and Shingon Buddhism were headquartered on sacred mountains: Tendai on Mt. Hiei and Shingon on Mt. Koya. On both of these mountains, for much ofthe medieval and early modern periods women were either forbidden to enter the mountain precincts or severely restricted in where they could go on the mountain. Women, including nuns, were believed to be spiritually inferior to men and to be subject to the ‘five obstructions’ (‘’gosho’’). The idea of the five obstructions asserted that women are unable to attain the five highest spiritual states, including the highest, that of a Buddha.//Some medieval Japanese Buddhist men held favorable views of women and their spiritual abilities. This was especially true among the new Buddhist schools of the Kamakura period. Pure Land traditions, for instance, with their emphasis on the possibility of universal salvation, included women in this view. Women were not only seen as capable of salvation, but were treated as full participants in the religious life. [...] Some Buddhists held the view, based on a Chinese sutra, that women were impure because of the blood associated with menstruation and childbirth. It was believed by these Buddhists that not only were women impure, but that this blood inevitably polluted the nearby water and soil.

In Shinto: “From earliest times, the role of female shamans in Shinto rites is apparent. An incident recorded in the Wei Dynasty records refers to a civil war that was ended when a 13-year-old girl called Himiko was made empress. While this may have been an incident in the kingdom of Yamatai , women empresses both reigned and ruled, especially Empress Jingū (reigned 201- 269) until Empress Kōken (reigned 749- 758) became involved with the would-be usurper Buddhist monk Dōkyō (died 722), after which the office was closed to women.//In spite of Western feminist attacks on the alleged male chauvinism of Japanese society, women in fact have served as priests ( kannushi ), imperial representatives, and in many other offices. Even Japanese Christianity ordained women clergy at least half a century before ordination of women began in a few traditions in Europe and the United States.//Restrictions on women have to do primarily with issues such as menstruation or childbirth, where blood may be found. Blood may be related to new life, but it also may link with death, and therefore creates impurity ( tsumi ) that must be removed by purification ( harai ). This is not a gender issue in the Western sense. The issue is any of the items that create impurity. [...] In spite of some feminist arguments coming from within Japan that Shinto is discriminatory in certain respects, taking into consideration of role of early empresses who practiced shamanism , and the number of women who in later periods led religious movements, especially among the New Religions . Shinto in its history, on the whole, seems to have been relatively open-minded toward women. The position and influence of women seems first to have been challenged and changed with the arrival of the highly male-centered and patriarchal culture of Buddhism from the Asian mainland to an extent that has not yet been fully realized or admitted by many scholars of Buddhism.” <sup id="cite_ref-387" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-387">[387]</a></sup> In Buddhism: “The attitude of male-dominated Japanese Buddhism has varied in its perspectives on women and the kind of religious lives and roles women were capable of assuming. Sometimes this view was negative toward women, and other times it was significantly more positive. Both Tendai and Shingon Buddhism were headquartered on sacred mountains: Tendai on Mt. Hiei and Shingon on Mt. Koya. On both of these mountains, for much ofthe medieval and early modern periods women were either forbidden to enter the mountain precincts or severely restricted in where they could go on the mountain. Women, including nuns, were believed to be spiritually inferior to men and to be subject to the ‘five obstructions’ (‘’gosho’’). The idea of the five obstructions asserted that women are unable to attain the five highest spiritual states, including the highest, that of a Buddha.//Some medieval Japanese Buddhist men held favorable views of women and their spiritual abilities. This was especially true among the new Buddhist schools of the Kamakura period. Pure Land traditions, for instance, with their emphasis on the possibility of universal salvation, included women in this view. Women were not only seen as capable of salvation, but were treated as full participants in the religious life. [...] Some Buddhists held the view, based on a Chinese sutra, that women were impure because of the blood associated with menstruation and childbirth. It was believed by these Buddhists that not only were women impure, but that this blood inevitably polluted the nearby water and soil. The result, it was claimed, was that women were condemned to rebirth in one of the nine levels of Buddhist hells unless Buddhist rituals were performed that would obviate this transgression.

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” <sup id="cite_ref-392" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-392">[392]</a></sup> Because polygyny was common among the Japanese aristocracy, it seems reasonable to assume that the above quote applies to this polity as well. “Polygamy by both genders was common in the early period, but as time went on, only males were still able to take on ‘other’ wives.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-395" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-395">[395]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-396" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-396">[396]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-465" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-465">[465]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-466" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-466">[466]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions.

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-477" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-477">[477]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Human enforcement of morality existed in medieval Japan, but it mostly consisted of religious authorities enforcing the correct conduct of monks and nuns, rather than policing the behaviour of communities more generally.<sup id="cite_ref-478" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-478">[478]</a></sup> As such, this variable cannot be coded as present.

The paradigmatic act was performed by Izanagi-no-mikoto when he has escaped from Yomi-nokuni where, according to the mythology recorded in the Nihon Shōki (720), he was visiting his deceased wife. The purpose of purification is to remove tsumi (impurity) and kegare (impurity caused by various human conditions) and restore human nature to its primal and pure state. Thus the idea that human nature can in some sense return to its divine origins lies behind all other related concepts. [...] Human beings are born able to live in harmony with the divine and with nature, but because of the various forms of impurity that overtake life, purification becomes necessary. Hence the importance of purification to effect restoration.// The goal to be achieved by the performance of misogi shuho , purification using water, is the cultivation of reisei , the Shinto ideal of spirituality. As the spirit is purified again and again, it can rise to the level of the divine as its spiritual sensitivity is heightened. The repairing and remaking of the kokoro is called tsukuri katame naosu.” <sup id="cite_ref-483" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-483">[483]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Human enforcement of morality existed in medieval Japan, but it mostly consisted of religious authorities enforcing the correct conduct of monks and nuns, rather than policing the behaviour of communities more generally.<sup id="cite_ref-484" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-484">[484]</a></sup> As such, this variable cannot be coded as present.

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.” <sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Human enforcement of morality existed in medieval Japan, but it mostly consisted of religious authorities enforcing the correct conduct of monks and nuns, rather than policing the behaviour of communities more generally.<sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup> As such, this variable cannot be coded as present.
