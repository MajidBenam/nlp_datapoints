The Late Neolithic period for that region started in 6600 BC when some kind of cultural transformation took place at the main site of the plain, at Çatalhöyük (East Mound) - this is visible in material culture (during VI occupational phase). The end is dated to 6000 BC, when, according to the archaeologists, another period called the Chalcolithic period began<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>. For now, four Late Neolithic sites are archaeologically recognizable in Konya Plain. These are: Çatalhöyük, Pιnarbașι rock shelter, Tepecik-Çiftlik and Can Hasan I.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It seems that the biggest and most populated (from 3,500 to 8000, with its peak at ca. 6600 BC, when the number of population started to decrease)<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>, Çatalhöyük, is the most crucial site within Konya Plain. This settlement was carefully excavated and examined for over 20 years and it gave us an uncomparable abundance of information. As a consequence, our understanding of the Late Neolithic of Konya Plain is dominated data from Çatalhöyük. There were no sites near Çatalhöyük that would have been permanently occupied<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>. However, during last 300 years many smaller settlements appear<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>. There is a possibility that Pιnarbașι rock shelter located in the distance of 24,5 km could have been a seasonal camp site designed for groups coming from Çatalhöyük<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>. At the site of Tepecik-Çiftlik and Can Hasan I, domestic structures were uncovered - however, the excavated areas are small in size<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>. Due to some cultural similarity (wall/floor plastering, intramural burials, bucrania, tools) between these sites, and a lack of evidence for centralization, this kind of polity structure can be called a quasi-polity.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]As the Late Neolithic society seems to be egalitarian, it is hard to say anything about hierarchical complexity. In Çatalhöyük, there is no social stratification visible in the material culture. All buildings are similar in having the same internal features, such as platforms, bucrania, burials under the floor, wall and floor plastering and with the space divided into a main room and a side room. There were no communal or utilitarian public buildings. However, there are some houses, called 'history houses' (name given by Hodder), which are different from other domestic structures. Their occupational periods seem to be longer (on average 70-100 years), and they have more additional elements such as installations and wall paintings. Additionally, more human burials were uncovered under their platforms than under other buildings. The presence of a significant number of people buried (more than could have lived in it) is particularly important as it suggests a special status for these houses<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>. These houses can be considered special purpose houses, creating a space for some rituals connected with burying dead and decapitation. According to Hodder, there may have been a ritual/religious specialist at Çatalhöyük, possessing knowledge of human anatomy<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]No evidence of writing system has been found for the Late Neolithic period in Konya PLain. In the case of money, there is a possibility that small stone balls found in Can Hasan could have been used as tokens.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Analyzing material remains, it does not look like warfare played an important role in the Late Neolithic of Konya Plain. Taking into account military technologies, it seems that most identified weapons were used in hunting activities. These are possibly projectiles such as slings from Canhasan<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>, arrowheads at Tepecik-Çiftlik<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> and Çatalhöyük<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>; also spears and possibly daggers (large obsidian projectile points) were found at Tepecik-Çiftlik<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>. However, identifying the specific uses of these weapons is complicated. For example, sheperds could have used large projectile points as weapons to protect domesticated animals from wild predators. These projectiles could have also been used as knives to butcher domesticated animals, or in social or ritual killing/processing of wild animals or human flesh<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>. Furthermore, Çatalhöyük wall paintings depict people using bows for hunting animals<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>, not in scenes connected with warfare. What is more, the location of Çatalhöyük was not in a defensive position and there were no fortification structures that would indicate engagement in warfare. There are also no signs of massacres or destruction at the site, which possibly means that inhabitants of the settlement were not involved in serious conflicts with any enemies.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Archaeological records seem to support the assumption that the ritual sphere of life was well developed. Inside the Late Neolithic houses at Çatalhöyük<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>, Tepecik-Çiftlik<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> and Canhasan<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>, plastered walls and floors were found. It almost certain that plastering was the most widespread and frequent ritual. At Çatalhöyük, walls could have been plastered every month or season. However, after V occupational phase, until the end of the Neolithic settlement, its frequency decreases along with the quality of plaster, which becomes thicker<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>. There are also installations made with animal bones (both wild and domesticated) attached to walls and embedded with plaster. These were found at Çatalhöyük<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>, Tepecik-Çiftlik<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> and at Pιnarbașι. In the case of the latter, there were plastered bones (plaster objects), rather than installations<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>. In the upper occupational levels, the number of such plastered features starts to decrease.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Another common type of ritual is intramural burial, where dead were buried under floors inside houses, and this occurred at Çatalhöyük<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>, Tepecik-Çiftlik<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> and Canhasan<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>. Burying close people could be assumed to have been a dysphoric ritual. At Çatalhöyük, later interferences can be seeb in some burials. Corpses deprived of skulls were found in history houses, which could have played a role in the circulation of skulls deposited in other houses<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>. If it was a part of an ancestor cult, it can be considered as a possibly euphoric ritual. In some way, decapitation is associated with animal skulls attached to the walls as bucrania, wall paintings depicting headless human figures, intentional destruction of creatures' body parts depicted in the form of reliefs (leopards and unidentified ‘splayed figures’) and fragmentation of figurines (both human and animal). It seems that the daily life of the Late Neolithic people living in houses was full of features related to rituals and the cult, and thus that the mundane sphere was strongly connected with, and inseparable from, the religious sphere. Although, it should be mentioned that during last three centuries of the occupation of the settlements, the number of such features decreases significantly <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In economic terms, some changes occured at Çatalhöyük the in upper layers, from V occupational layer up. In the IV layer, food production became more important, which is visible in archaeological records in the form of the central positioning of hearths inside main rooms, but also in the appearance of large storage pots. House building became more specialized and buildings are related to each other through exchange. It seems that houses got larger and gained independence. The streets became wider and the buildings had more free space between them. Also, the duration and occupation period of houses becomes shorter<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>. During the last 300 years of the Late Neolithic period, there is evidence for changes in subsistence and animal herding, integrating arable with the pastoral economy. Inhabitants ceased the exploitation of oak timber, which was accessible from the surrounding uplands, and started to use locally available sources of wood. Also, animal herding was managed close to growing crops<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>. At Çatalhöyük, agriculture production played the most important role, as the major sources of nutrition were cereals such as emmer wheat<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>. But apart from exploiting domesticated plants and animals (sheep, goat), wild seeds and cattle were eaten as well<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is supposed that at the beginning of the Late Neolithic period, people were cooperating during hunting activities and in collecting raw material. Groups of men attacking wild animals are depicted on the wall paintings<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>. There is also a great possibility that some groups coming from Çatalhöyük, were seasonally using Pιnarbașι rock shelter<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>. Furthermore, some cooperation would have been needed during ca. 13-day-long journeys<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> to locations in Capadoccia (in a distance of 170-190 km), Nenezi Daǧ and Göllü Daǧ, with the aim of collecting obsidian<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> or to collect other raw materials such as marble from a place located 40 km away<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Apart from actions taken for economic purposes, repetitive rituals could have unified people and provided some stability. Through frequent replasterings of walls and keeping similar features in houses (e.g. bucrania, burials under floors and wall paintings), people could feel unity with each other and their mutual bonds could have been strengthened. Also, the cult of ancestors shared by the whole community could have unified its members. Despite a lack of evidence for social stratification, history houses as places full of burials and elaborations can be assumed to have played a role of some religious/ritual centers. There is a possibility that the changes that occurred in the uppermost layers, together with other factors, contributed to some social instability of communities inhabiting small areas. The decreasing number of internal house features, shifts in strategies of production and building construction that indicated an increase in house independence, could have finally resulted in the abandonment of the East Mound at Çatalhöyük and appearance of many other smaller settlements nearby.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>It is hard to identify the mode of government due to the lack of knowledge about the relations between the settlements. There is only an assumption that Pιnarbașι rock shelter was occupied by groups from the Çatalhöyük, for both economical and non-economical purposes(see above), but there is no certainty of that. That could have been another group of people living as mobile hunter-gatherers and penetrating area between Pιnarbașι and Çatalhöyük<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>. During the Late Neolithic, Çatalhöyük seems to have been the biggest urban centre in the Konya Plain and for that reason it could have played a central role in the area<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>, but there is no certainty that people from this settlement were ruling over Can Hasan I or Tepecik-Çiftlik societies, and what was the mode of mutual relation.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We have no information about warfare relations between the settlements.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]There is a possibility that some kind of economic regulation could have been present between the Çatalhöyük settlement and Pιnarbașι rock shelter, because the latter has possibly been used by Çatalhöyük society for economical purposes, such as hunting and processing animals, sheep culling, herd management and tool manufacture<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>, but it is quite unknown.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the Çatalhöyük settlement, people were using a source of clay located nearby. To the North of the East Mound many marl extraction pits were found. As these pits reached down into the sands underneath the marl, it created another local source of clay.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Two main sources were available for Çatalhöyük inhabitants during the Neolithic: Pleistocene Lake Konya and the Holocene alluvial clays of the Çarsamba and May rivers flowing across Lake Konya bed. However, The Early Neolithic (pre-VII occupational level) extensive exploitation of blackswamp clays, marl and Pleistocene sediments coming from around the mounds possibly could have degraded the area creating extraction pits - the deeper ones could have been rather permanent pools connected by minor channels, the shallower ones could have dried out during summer. Due to drying in the Late Neolithic, streams came together creating a larger channel with fewer pools. Clay extraction pits lay in lower shallow pools (alluvium areas), between drier grounds. After VII occupational level, Pleistocene sediments probably became less available and for that reason colluvium started to be exploited for mudbricks<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Oak trees and other tree species were located in the nearest uplands of the Çatalhöyük settlement<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>. Since 6500 cal BC, juniper took oaks place and became the dominant charcoal taxon. This change is not related woodland composition, climate changes nor with accessibility to some wood species. The change was probably linked to the shift in the choice of wood species from these located in near uplands to those growing nearer to the site<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It seems that inhabitants were using mainly one major source.

For upper levels (Late Neolithic), Hodder suggests a shift in gender organization. There are more female burials inside houses and figurines depicting women (especially famous figurines of seated women). Due to craft specialization and industrialization of food preparation women's lifestyle could have become more connected with domestic sphere while men could have spent time doing their tasks outdoors.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>. Whether this gender distinction was in any way connected to some kind of inequality is quite unknown, as these assumptions are just interpretations.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is hard to estimate.

However, whether it was the role of elders to punish other members of society is unknown.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is hard to make any assumptions about imposing exile due to lack of any evidence that this kind of punishment was even in practice.

Two houses in Levels V and III have wall paintings that show the teasing and baiting of wild animals (bulls, deer, boars, a bear) by crowds of people, in one case clearly bearded (Mellaart 1966, 1967). The hunting and baiting scenes show animals with erect penises. In the deposits on the site it is clear that the meat-bearing parts of wild bulls are often associated with feasting events. The meat-bearing parts of deer and boars are rarely found on-site, and researchers have so far found the claws of only one bear. Other rare finds are a leopard claw and the talons of large raptors. So it seems possible to argue that on rare occasions wild animals and birds were killed, perhaps at times in association with male feats of bravery and strength. Consumption of many of these animals took place off-site, but the wild bull meat was eaten and distributed to feasts on-site. The hard and dangerous parts of these animals (claws, horns, antlers, tusks, talons) were then inserted as trophies or memories into the walls of the houses, where they were repeatedly plastered over as part of the general plastering of the house walls. The scale and emotional tonus of teasing and baiting at Çatalhöyük can be determined partly by the large number of human figures in scenes depicted in surviving artwork at the site. The haunches of the wild bulls at Çatalhöyük stood 2 m in height. Bringing down or teasing and baiting such an animal would have presented grave danger (perhaps even resulting in fatalities). The teasing and baiting scenes seem to be accompanied by dancing and music (as seen in the apparent rattles and drums depicted). "Feasts resulting from such kills at Çatalhöyük would have been moments of high social drama, not only because of the fear and danger occasioned by the quarry but also because of the sheer scale of such social events. It has been estimated that the meat from a wild bull could have fed a thousand people (based on figures from contemporary feasts using domestic cattle in central Anatolia). And the faunal remains at Çatalhöyük provide additional clues to the scale and frequency of feasting events on-site. As to scale, it seems possible that parts of animals were distributed to houses or house groups, as there is often sidedness involved involved in the distribution of parts. For example, Building 52 had 11 left bull horns stacked above a bucranium. It seems that certain houses received certain parts of animals in feasts. Even so, a considerable number could have been involved, and the feasting deposits often contain the remains of bones of more than one animal. As to frequency, if we identify the installations of bull horns on walls as the main markers of significant feasting events and rituals, the maximum is 6 in one house, and a stack of 11 uninstalled horns has just been mentioned. Similarly, few deposits have been found that seem to result from major feasts - in the region of 1-3 per house. If we estimate the houses as enduring for about 80 years, then we have events involving feasting and wild animals occurring every 7-80 years." <sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ once per generation ♥</b> <i>"Since one house has a stack of 11 uninstalled horns maybe this implies a frequency of once very 7 years or so but that’s surely an outlier.

"Rare, climactic, revelatory rituals bind participants tightly together into highly cohesive groups. In part this is because the emotionality of the shared experience binds people together, a well-established principle in social psychology that requires little additional evidential support. But it is also partly a consequence of episodic recall - the fact that most people can remember exactly who else was present when the major ritual took place (Whitehouse 1992, 2004). Cohesive ritual communities forged in this way are therefore somewhat exclusive, in that one cannot easily fabricate a memory that somebody was present who was not or excise from memory the recollection of another's participation. This exclusivity and cohesiveness also promotes a somewhat egalitarian ethos among members of the in-group and, above all, a sense of loyalty in the face of danger. As such, groups formed by such means lend themselves admirably to perilous exploits where temptations to defect would otherwise be hard to resist. In many societies where the imagistic mode flourishes, this means that ritual groupings constitute military cells or raiding parties. But at Çatalhöyük, as has also been found in many other places, cohesive ritual groups were probably essential for the cooperative hunting of exceptionally dangerous wild animals.

high-arousal rituals at Çatalhöyük comes in part from pictorial remains. Two houses in Levels V and III have wall paintings that show the teasing and baiting of wild animals (bulls, deer, boars, a bear) by crowds of people, in one case clearly bearded (Mellaart 1966, 1967). The hunting and baiting scenes show animals with erect penises. In the deposits on the site it is clear that the meat-bearing parts of wild bulls are often associated with feasting events. The meat-bearing parts of deer and boars are rarely found on-site, and researchers have so far found the claws of only one bear. Other rare finds are a leopard claw and the talons of large raptors. So it seems possible to argue that on rare occasions wild animals and birds were killed, perhaps at times in association with male feats of bravery and strength. Consumption of many of these animals took place off-site, but the wild bull meat was eaten and distributed to feasts on-site. The hard and dangerous parts of these animals (claws, horns, antlers, tusks, talons) were then inserted as trophies or memories into the walls of the houses, where they were repeatedly plastered over as part of the general plastering of the house walls. The scale and emotional tonus of teasing and baiting at Çatalhöyük can be determined partly by the large number of human figures in scenes depicted in surviving artwork at the site. The haunches of the wild bulls at Çatalhöyük stood 2 m in height. Bringing down or teasing and baiting such an animal would have presented grave danger (perhaps even resulting in fatalities). The teasing and baiting scenes seem to be accompanied by dancing and music (as seen in the apparent rattles and drums depicted). "Feasts resulting from such kills at Çatalhöyük would have been moments of high social drama, not only because of the fear and danger occasioned by the quarry but also because of the sheer scale of such social events. It has been estimated that the meat from a wild bull could have fed a thousand people (based on figures from contemporary feasts using domestic cattle in central Anatolia). And the faunal remains at Çatalhöyük provide additional clues to the scale and frequency of feasting events on-site. As to scale, it seems possible that parts of animals were distributed to houses or house groups, as there is often sidedness involved involved in the distribution of parts. For example, Building 52 had 11 left bull horns stacked above a bucranium. It seems that certain houses received certain parts of animals in feasts. Even so, a considerable number could have been involved, and the feasting deposits often contain the remains of bones of more than one animal. As to frequency, if we identify the installations of bull horns on walls as the main markers of significant feasting events and rituals, the maximum is 6 in one house, and a stack of 11 uninstalled horns has just been mentioned. Similarly, few deposits have been found that seem to result from major feasts - in the region of 1-3 per house. If we estimate the houses as enduring for about 80 years, then we have events involving feasting and wild animals occurring every 7-80 years." <sup id="cite_ref-144" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-144">[144]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ once per generation ♥</b> <i>"Since one house has a stack of 11 uninstalled horns maybe this implies a frequency of once very 7 years or so but that’s surely an outlier.

Cohesive ritual communities forged in this way are therefore somewhat exclusive, in that one cannot easily fabricate a memory that somebody was present who was not or excise from memory the recollection of another's participation. This exclusivity and cohesiveness also promotes a somewhat egalitarian ethos among members of the in-group and, above all, a sense of loyalty in the face of danger.

Two houses in Levels V and III have wall paintings that show the teasing and baiting of wild animals (bulls, deer, boars, a bear) by crowds of people, in one case clearly bearded (Mellaart 1966, 1967). The hunting and baiting scenes show animals with erect penises. In the deposits on the site it is clear that the meat-bearing parts of wild bulls are often associated with feasting events. The meat-bearing parts of deer and boars are rarely found on-site, and researchers have so far found the claws of only one bear. Other rare finds are a leopard claw and the talons of large raptors. So it seems possible to argue that on rare occasions wild animals and birds were killed, perhaps at times in association with male feats of bravery and strength. Consumption of many of these animals took place off-site, but the wild bull meat was eaten and distributed to feasts on-site. The hard and dangerous parts of these animals (claws, horns, antlers, tusks, talons) were then inserted as trophies or memories into the walls of the houses, where they were repeatedly plastered over as part of the general plastering of the house walls. The scale and emotional tonus of teasing and baiting at Çatalhöyük can be determined partly by the large number of human figures in scenes depicted in surviving artwork at the site. The haunches of the wild bulls at Çatalhöyük stood 2 m in height. Bringing down or teasing and baiting such an animal would have presented grave danger (perhaps even resulting in fatalities). The teasing and baiting scenes seem to be accompanied by dancing and music (as seen in the apparent rattles and drums depicted). "Feasts resulting from such kills at Çatalhöyük would have been moments of high social drama, not only because of the fear and danger occasioned by the quarry but also because of the sheer scale of such social events. It has been estimated that the meat from a wild bull could have fed a thousand people (based on figures from contemporary feasts using domestic cattle in central Anatolia). And the faunal remains at Çatalhöyük provide additional clues to the scale and frequency of feasting events on-site. As to scale, it seems possible that parts of animals were distributed to houses or house groups, as there is often sidedness involved involved in the distribution of parts. For example, Building 52 had 11 left bull horns stacked above a bucranium. It seems that certain houses received certain parts of animals in feasts. Even so, a considerable number could have been involved, and the feasting deposits often contain the remains of bones of more than one animal. As to frequency, if we identify the installations of bull horns on walls as the main markers of significant feasting events and rituals, the maximum is 6 in one house, and a stack of 11 uninstalled horns has just been mentioned. Similarly, few deposits have been found that seem to result from major feasts - in the region of 1-3 per house. If we estimate the houses as enduring for about 80 years, then we have events involving feasting and wild animals occurring every 7-80 years." <sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ once per generation ♥</b> <i>"Since one house has a stack of 11 uninstalled horns maybe this implies a frequency of once very 7 years or so but that’s surely an outlier.

suggest very similar diets and lifestyles between men and women and there is little evidence of specialized tasks for either sex. For example, the stable isotope analysis for human bones does not demonstrate statistically significant differences in the diet for males and females (Richards and Pearson 2005). Taken together, this suggests little differentiation in the allocation of roles and activities at the site. Similarly, the burial data and treatment of individual bodies confirms this lack of differentiation between the sexes. With regards to placement, posture, and directionality, there are no marked differences as Mellaart once claimed (Hodder 2006b: 211; Molleson et al. 2005). The number of grave goods associated with burials at the site is relatively small, and some gendered differences have been noted in previous analyses; however, it would be difficult to argue for some clearly demarcated pattern (Hodder 2006a, b: 212). These data argue against the older ideas of matriarchy or a special status for women and instead formulate a picture of a society where men and women participated in similar kinds of labor, sustained similar injuries, shared a similar diet, died at comparable ages, and were ultimately buried with similar treatments and objects. The representational sphere thus constitutes one domain where researchers might be able to examine ideational bodily regimes and articulations that might both tease apart and blur gender conceptualizations; basic quantification and trait analysis are methods that might move us closer to uncovering Neolithic concerns rather than simply confirming our own predilections." <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought equates people of all locations ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes rulers and commoners ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes elites and commoners ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes all ethnicities ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "Several lines of evidence suggest very similar diets and lifestyles between men and women and there is little evidence of specialized tasks for either sex.

[...] In the deposits on the site it is clear that the meat-bearing parts of wild bulls are often associated with feasting events. The meat-bearing parts of deer and boars are rarely found on-site, and researchers have so far found the claws of only one bear. Other rare finds are a leopard claw and the talons of large raptors. So it seems possible to argue that on rare occasions wild animals and birds were killed, perhaps at times in association with male feats of bravery and strength. [...] The hard and dangerous parts of these animals (claws, horns, antlers, tusks, talons) were then inserted as trophies or memories into the walls of the houses, where they were repeatedly plastered over as part of the general plastering of the house walls. [...] The haunches of the wild bulls at Çatalhöyük stood 2 m in height. Bringing down or teasing and baiting such an animal would have presented grave danger (perhaps even resulting in fatalities)." <sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"><a
