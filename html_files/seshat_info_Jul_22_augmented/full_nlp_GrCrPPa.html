EC replaced rituals selected by KC with rituals suggested by Eleni Hatzaki and Colin MacDonald at the conference in Knossos in May 2016.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ Kostis Christakis ♥</b>General Description of Ritual: During this period  "there seems to be an increasing emphasis on built shrines, whether within  a settlement or isolated, and on open-air sanctuaries accessible from settlements, as at Ayia Triada; their dating is of the rather imprecise, col lack of sufficiently distinctive pottery, but many seems to be LM IIIB. The shrines have much in common with the older 'branch sanctuaries', thought there is no clear evidence that animal sacrifice was  associate with them; but there is evidence for sacrifice, and for the dedication of animal figurines, at ope-air sites, both old and new, and other types of dedication in bronze and clay were offered particularly at the Piazzale die Sacelli site at Ayai Triada. The ritual inters most commonly found associated with the built shrines, the 'goddess with upraised arms'  figures and 'snake tubes' can be derived from older sources, although the figurine sequence is patchy ad the apparent prototypes of the 'snake tubs' are virtually unique to Kato Syme and nearby Pyrgos. Yet both figures and tubs are commonly embellished with 'horns of consecration', birds and snakes, demonstrating the continuity vitality of these sacred symbols, and double axes survived, if less prominently.  Cave cults have been argued to become prominent in this period, in than many of those claimed to be colt sites have produced LM III material only. But this material has never been published in detail and interpretations relating to ordinary or 'refuge' occupation have sometimes been advanced." ... " 'Goddess with upraised arms' figures do not seem to have been found in caves, but are otherwise one of the most characteristic ritual types of LM III Crete. They often occur in groups, which are basically similar thought differing in details, and there is room for doubt whether they represent the same or different personalities. The discovery of at least seventeen in one LM IIIC deposit from Kavousi, along with many 'snake tube' fragments, suggest that perhaps they diid represent only one goddess, whose image, along with an associated 'snake tube' which apparently supported an offering vessel, was replaced from time to time; alternatively, several may have been simultaneously, as at Gazi, perhaps by different communities who used the  same site. They could still be interpreted as representing essentially local figures, the ancestors of the largely localized deities of the later Crete like Britomartis, Diktynna and Eileithyia, though conceived in the same idiom. This type did not spread to other pats of the Aegean, whereas the large wheel made animal figurine, which seems to appear first in Crete, certainly did. This capacity to develop new types of ritual item, seen in other types of figurine, including groups and centaur-like figures, testifies to the continuing vitality of the Minoan religious tradition, although no class was mass-produced like the Mycenaean figurines. The survival of traditional symbols like the double axe and 'horns of consecration' also emphasizes the strong link to the past.

In particular, there is some evidence suggesting that the hunting and/or subjugation of lions, and the use of seals depicting these activities, was a key way in which elites advertised their power and prestige. It is worth noting that lions were not present in prehistoric Crete, or, at least, they were not native to the island: instead, it seems likely that, starting from the Neopalatial Period onwards, aristocrats either imported lions from foreign lands or hunted the animals while travelling to the foreign lands themselves. "Depictions of lions in the Final Palace period tend to be seen as more conventional, with more formal poses and designs. Younger (1985: 51-2) suggests that the later lion depictions were hardly based on observation. One argument against this is provided by a sealing from Knossos which, as Rhyne (1970: 186) observed, shows a ‘hair star’ on the shoulder of the lion (Plate 6b): although this could be an observation imported from the Near East, nevertheless it points to a continuing interest in the details of lion morphology (Arkell 1948; Bate 1950; Kantor 1947). The ‘Master of Animals’ depictions are typical of the Final Palace period, most often featuring lions either side of a central figure. Bloedow has argued that, rather than seeing such arrangements as symbolic, they can be interpreted as depicting lion subjugation: ‘Clearly, this is not a fate which lions would have chosen for themselves, and so depicts in supremely dramatic fashion the sheer violence by which they had been brought into subjection’ (Bloedow 1996: 1163-4). Like hunting scenes, these seals can be seen as providing information about the practices involving lions; these later depictions make explicit the practice of subduing a dangerous animal, and so can be seen, like other depictions of lions, as indexes of a dangerous activity. [...] Even if lions were brought to Crete, however, depictions continue to show them as dangerous predators, attacking other animals. The mane is the key to lion depictions throughout Minoan seal engraving, and one can see these depictions as increasingly providing information about the animal whose mane it was. Often the information was incorrect, in comparison with modern zoological knowledge about lions, but this is not always a useful standard against which to judge these depictions. To dismiss these differences simply as poor artisanship is to overlook the fact that they can be seen as useful indicators of what the seal engraver and seal owner knew about lions.

In particular, there is some evidence suggesting that the hunting and/or subjugation of lions, and the use of seals depicting these activities, was a key way in which elites advertised their power and prestige. It is worth noting that lions were not present in prehistoric Crete, or, at least, they were not native to the island: instead, it seems likely that, starting from the Neopalatial Period onwards, aristocrats either imported lions from foreign lands or hunted the animals while travelling to the foreign lands themselves. "Depictions of lions in the Final Palace period tend to be seen as more conventional, with more formal poses and designs. Younger (1985: 51-2) suggests that the later lion depictions were hardly based on observation. One argument against this is provided by a sealing from Knossos which, as Rhyne (1970: 186) observed, shows a ‘hair star’ on the shoulder of the lion (Plate 6b): although this could be an observation imported from the Near East, nevertheless it points to a continuing interest in the details of lion morphology (Arkell 1948; Bate 1950; Kantor 1947). The ‘Master of Animals’ depictions are typical of the Final Palace period, most often featuring lions either side of a central figure. Bloedow has argued that, rather than seeing such arrangements as symbolic, they can be interpreted as depicting lion subjugation: ‘Clearly, this is not a fate which lions would have chosen for themselves, and so depicts in supremely dramatic fashion the sheer violence by which they had been brought into subjection’ (Bloedow 1996: 1163-4). Like hunting scenes, these seals can be seen as providing information about the practices involving lions; these later depictions make explicit the practice of subduing a dangerous animal, and so can be seen, like other depictions of lions, as indexes of a dangerous activity. [...] Even if lions were brought to Crete, however, depictions continue to show them as dangerous predators, attacking other animals. The mane is the key to lion depictions throughout Minoan seal engraving, and one can see these depictions as increasingly providing information about the animal whose mane it was. Often the information was incorrect, in comparison with modern zoological knowledge about lions, but this is not always a useful standard against which to judge these depictions. To dismiss these differences simply as poor artisanship is to overlook the fact that they can be seen as useful indicators of what the seal engraver and seal owner knew about lions. Later seals displayed the affordances of the lion as a dangerous animal to be hunted. The seal itself afforded the user of the seal a way to demonstrate knowledge of an unfamiliar animal and associate themselves with the animal practice of lion hunting. Yet these seal depictions reveal varying levels of familiarity with lions." <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown.
