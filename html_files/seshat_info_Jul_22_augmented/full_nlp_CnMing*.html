According to the regulations of 1377, a series of rites, including rites of seclusion (<i>zhaijie</i>), transmission of imperial orders (<i>chuanzhi</i>), and inspection of sacrificial animals (<i>shengsheng</i>), were performed before the date when sacrifices were offered. The rites performed on the day of sacrifices were even more important. Altogether ten rites were performed on that day: (1) welcoming the spirits (<i>qingshen</i>), (2) presenting silk (<i>dianbo</i>), (3) proffering the flesh (<i>jinzu</i>), (4) initial oblation (<i>chuxian</i>), (5) middle oblation (<i>yaxian</i>), (6) final oblation (<i>zhongxian</i>), (7) granting felicitous liquor and meat (<i>ci fuzu</i>), (8) removing the viands (<i>chezhuan</i>), (9) sending off the spirits (<i>songshen</i>), and (10) watching the burning of offerings (<i>wangliao</i>). "(1-3). In the rite of welcoming the spirits, the managers of the ceremonies instructed the musicians and dancers, supervising officials, and those who were to participate in the ritual to take their places, while the conductor (<i>daoyin guan</i>) directed the emperor to take his place. Following the guidance of the inner assistant (<i>neizan</i>) and the manager of ceremonies, offerings were burned, the hair and blood of sacrificial animals buried, spirits welcomed, and music performed. When all these things were done, the emperor ascended to the highest terrace of the altar and presented jade and silk to the tablets of Heaven, Earth, and Renzu, Emperor Hongwu’s own father, under the guidance of the manager of ceremonies and the inner assistant. Again, the rite of proffering the flesh was performed before the tablets of Heaven and Earth by the emperor under the guidance of the inner assistant. "(4-6). After the rite of proffering the flesh, the rites of initial, middle, and final oblations were performed. In this set of oblation rites, the emperor ascended to the highest terrace and presented the <i>jue</i> to the altars of the Heaven, Earth, and Renzu under the guidance of the manager of ceremonies and the inner assistant. Music and ritual dance were performed. During the initial oblation, a sacrificial essay (<i>zhu</i>) was read aloud by the prayer reciter (<i>du zhu guan</i>). This was the central part of the ritual. "(7-10). Unlike other rites, the rite of granting felicitous liquor and meat was performed under the guidance of the minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices as well as the inner assistant. In the following three rites, viands were removed, the spirits sent off, and the sacrificial essay, silk, and viands burned. Music was performed during these rites.

"In the Ming, the New Year began in the home with offerings to the ancestors and gods and then the hierarchized paying of respects within the household. The 1491 Fujian gazetteer describes this as bowing in order (<i>xubai</i>): 'The custom in Fujian is to greatly esteem New Year's. As soon as it is light everyone dresses in their finest clothes and makes offerings [at the domestic altar]. After they bow in order to one another and offer best wishes, wishing longevity to the elders. Later they go to pay their respects to their kin in neighbouring areas, going back and forth visiting." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_359_CnMing*] "Sources provide many descriptions of the splendid sights of Fuzhou and its surrounding towns during the Lantern Festival in the Ming [which was celebrated at the end of the New Year rituals, RA's note]. The mid-sixteenth century gazetteer of Fuqing reports: 'On the long streets and the twisted lanes, each gate erects a pair of firs, to which [are attached] horizontal [poles of] fresh bamboo. From these are hung lanterns. The lanterns are made of cloth, porcelain, bamboo fiber, etc. They are all decorated with images of people, stories, or flowers, fruits, animals, etc. There are also things like horse lamps and dragon and tiger lamps.' Whereas Song sources describe considerable official influence on the celebration, by the Ming, the Lantern Festival no longer directly involved the state or its representatives. 'Since the [beginning] of the current dynasty, in the celebration of the New Year among the people, some hold celebrations in their own places, so the official <i>yamen</i> no longer holds the celebration. This demonstrates the frugality and moderation promoted by the imperial ancestors.' In fact, local officials even tried to suppress popular celebration of the festival, especially after 1585, when lanterns caused a fire in Fuzhou that destroyed over one thousand homes. But it was no use, for there was no support for the prohibitions from the usual agents of the state in local society. 'The officials attempted to forbid these activities, but the gentry and scholars were unsettled for they enjoy the spectacle. In this month the people of the whole prefecture behave as if they are mad."

One could not apply for palace exams without having passed metropolitan exams, for metropolitan exams without having passed provincial exams, and for provincial exams without having passed local exams. All types of exams took place in prison-like compounds designed to curb cheating, all four involved questions regarding Confucian classics, poetry and national policy issues, and all four caused heightened anxiety in candidates [MAJIDBENAM_REF_398_CnMing*]. The palace exam has been chosen as the most dysphoric simply because its stakes were highest. "The exams were state occasions. Held triennially, the <i>jinshi</i> event constituted a high point in the capital's calendar with thousands participating, thousands more providing tutorial support, sustenance and encouragement, and yet more working as invigilators, scrutineers and assessors. To preclude cheating, each candidate was installed in his own wooden cubicle. His desk by day served as his couch by night, and for better supervision the lines of cubicles lay open along one side, like a row of latrines. Responsibility for the exam rested not with the Ministry of Personnel but the Ministry of Rites, and <i>jinshi</i> literally meaning 'presented shi', it included a final viva in the presence of the emperor himself. Once again, ritual underlay the whole system. Scholars, just like tribute-bearers, supposedly conformed to the cosmic pattern of attraction, being drawn into the imperial orbit by its sheer centrality. Their attendance affirmed its legitimacy and their distinction added lustre to its brilliance." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_399_CnMing*] "The anxiety from preparing for the Keju exams [which resulted in a <i>jinshi</i> degree] and the disappointment of doing poorly on them led to incidents of pathological behavior. Repeatedly failing the Keju exams took a severe psychological toll on the failed candidates. Effects of failure ranged from mild cases of self-doubt to various psychopathologies and, in some cases, to suicide or physical violence directed at others. In her analysis of classic exam-related novels, Judith Zeitlin found that physicians during the Ming dynasty had identified a specific form of anxiety-depression, called by these physicians <i>siyu</i> and referred to as 'male anxiety' by Benjamin Elman, that is associated with repeatedly failing the Keju exams.

Success on the civil examinations evolved as a prerogative of the wealthy and powerful in local communities.

Just which of them were available at the early period (before the T'ang dynasty) in Chinese translation is a subject for another investigation, but there is no doubt that they were fairly numerous.

[...] It must be admitted that the Chinese hardly contributed anything to the structure or the punishments of purgatory, but simply took over literally the ideas that had arrived from India."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_595_CnMing*] <i>The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_596_CnMing*] </i>The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_597_CnMing*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of fairness ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_599_CnMing*]  </i>The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_612_CnMing*] </i>[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_613_CnMing*]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of respect ♣ present ♥</b> "All students have recognized that it was Buddhism which furnished a completely worked out theory of sin and punishment to the Chinese, and there are many Buddhist texts which describe this purgatorial system.

In a later text, the Book of Ritual, it is noted that a filial son may speak up to criticize his parents three times, but, if ignored, he is to follow their wishes. Similarly, it says, a government minister should speak to his ruler and offer advice and criticism. If after three attempts the ruler continues to ignore the min- ister, the minister should resign.

The term goes back to the Bronze Age (and is not exclusive to Confucianism - indeed, virtually every Chinese ethical tradition had a concept of filial piety), but before Confucius it had referred to reverence for all ancestors, and mostly had to do with due sacrifice on their behalf. As with so many other moral and religious terms, Confucius and his followers radically reinterpreted it 5 to mean appropriate behaviour visà-vis one’s parents, and not only after their death. Merely providing sustenance was immediately disparaged as grotesquely inadequate: ‘Ziyou [i.e. the disciple Yan Yan, b. 506 bce] asked about filial piety. The Master said: “What is ‘filial’ nowadays refers to the ability to feed [one’s parents]. Even dogs and horses can be fed.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_634_CnMing*] In Daoism: “From the very beginning of the written tradition of Taoism, there existed a close relation between it and Chinese military and practice. The ‘’Daode jing’’ contains passages that propounded ideas about the nature of warfare (that weapons are inauspicious implements; desolation follows an army) and the proper way for the ruler to engage in combat (conquer strength by manifesting weakness; do not value victory; do not attempt to dominate the world by force of arms) that were immensely influential in later times. [...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_635_CnMing*] Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures.
