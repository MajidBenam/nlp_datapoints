The sanctuary is situated in a gorge in the eastern part of the valley of Izeh (Malamir). Most conspicuous are its six reliefs (KF I-VI), depicting various cultic acts and stages in a grand sacrificial feast, carved on the rock faces of the gorge and on three boulders. All are near the entrance to the gorge. One of the reliefs is accompanied by a long Neo-Elamite inscription (EKI 75) and ten short captions (EKI 75A-K). The subjects of the reliefs may be summarized as follows: "KF I (northern face): ruler with two court officials, one carrying (the ruler’s?) bow, quiver, and sword; musicians with harps and drum (?); officiants with a humped bovid and sacrificed rams at an altar; inscription and captions identifying the figures. "KF II (boulder): ruler in praying attitude; attendants and officiants sacrificing a humped bovid and six other animals. "KF III (boulder): ruler lifted on a platform (depicted twice); a host of participants in superimposed registers on both sides marching in procession toward the sacrifice; harp players; sacrificial animals (18 smaller animals, 3 humped bovids). "KF IV (southern face): banquet with seated ruler before table accompanied by attendants and court dignitaries (one carrying bow, quiver, and sword); six harp players and their conductor; numerous participants in registers (on panels left, below, and right of the central relief ) oriented toward the king and lifting their right hands to their mouths (paying homage to the king or eating?); six officiants (?) on the extreme left near the fire-altar or fire bowls (cf. below). "KF V (southern face): ruler in praying attitude followed by his retinue; thymiaterion; officiant slaughtering humped bovid; six more sacrificed animals. "KF VI (boulder): ruler in praying attitude, lifted on a platform, and followed by a short procession of his retinue (one dignitary carrying a quiver); another surface prepared but not used for an additional relief."[...] "There is no agreement among scholars on the date of Kul-e Farah. Some have dated all reliefs to various stages of the Neo-Elamite period, while in more recent studies most are dated to the Middle Elamite period. [...]"[...] "As in the case of sip, the feast of Aiapir may well have been celebrated annually, during the autumn season. This suspicion rests on the assumption that the region of eastern Khuzestan and western Fars is most suitable for agro-pastoralism and on the observation that tribes adapted to that way of life made up, until recently, most of the population in these parts. Within the grand system of migration routes and seasonal pastures in what is commonly known as the Bakhtiari Mountains, the Izeh valley functions as garmsir land and is used as winter residence by the Car Lang. The pastoralists descend to the area in September/October from their summer pastures in the eastern mountains (in the direction of Esfahan) and stay until April/May. Because the autumn rutting season falls in October and lambs from the summer season are born in Novem- ber (cf. Barth 1961: 7), autumn is the best time to reduce the herds by slaughtering or selling the surplus of yearling animals as well as infertile ewes. This has the additional advantage of lowering the need for fodder during the winter season. In the days of Hanni and his predecessors, conditions are likely to have been similar, even though there may have been a more important sedentary segment resident in the valley. It may therefore be expected that the feast of Kul-e Farah took place in autumn.[...] "The central role of the ruler is a prominent feature of both sip and the feast of Aiapir. The fact that the ruler of Aiapir is depicted on all six reliefs in Kul-e Farah and that sacrifices are always performed right in front of him indicate his role as the celebration’s protagonist.[...] "The centrality of the king also found visual expression during the sacrificial feast. At Aiapir, we find the ruler enthroned and surrounded by a multitude of banquet guests who have all turned their faces to him and pay him homage with their gestures (KF I). The king also leads the procession toward the sanctuary (KF III, VI). To accentuate his position even more, the ruler is raised on a platform and carried to the place where the sacrifice takes place. [...] "Not only the position of the ruler but that of every participant found explicit expression at the sacrificial feast. Visible hierarchy was a key element. As De Waele (1972: 2-3; 1989: 34) notes, the Kul-e Farah reliefs are a panorama of an intricate social pyramid in which status is expressed by size, arrangement, closeness to the king, representation in frontal view or in profile, garments, hair-cut, and beard. [...]"[...]"Like sip, the feast at Aiapir may have been a forum at which the king could pay off “debts” by awarding seats of honor to his servants in the local government. That Hanni chose to mention his principal ministers by name in the inscriptions on KF I and that these officials are positioned close to the ruler similarly imply recognition for services rendered. As for the base level of ordinary Aiapirans and workers in the Persepolis economy, the banquets meant access to rare meat rations for larger groups (§6.3.3): a true feast! "The unity of the ruler and his god would of course have been stressed to the maximum during sacrificial feasts such as sip and the one celebrated at Aiapir. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the gods associated with sip or earlier sup are closely connected to the ruler or the dynasty, including Insusinak, Sasum, and Auramazda (§7.1.6). No doubt, Hanni will have adopted a similar attitude vis-à-vis Tirutur. Yet, in the end, neither the king nor the god is the principle participant in the sacrificial feast. That which is celebrated is the community that convenes and reconstitutes itself. Group identity, social hierarchy, and bonds of loyalty are reconfirmed in the sacrifice and the ensuing banquet. This is of special importance in a situation whereby ruler and subjects are separated from each other during large parts of the year. Sedentary and pastoralist Aiapirans, the latter returning from their summer abode, were reunited amid the reliefs of Kul-e Farah, those sublime expressions of their common identity. [...] Traditional hymns played an important role in Persian religious experience (references in Briant 2002: 245, 330), as did music, and, probably, song in Kul-e Farah. Such a musical setting may have served to connect the present to the past and to lift the momentary experience of the feast to a timeless level. At Aiapir, this connection with the past is made tangible in such a way that visiting the site is still a haunting experience. Not only the king and priests, but all members of the community found themselves mirrored on the surrounding reliefs when they entered the gorge for the annual feast. The engraving on the stone of the very ceremony that they were about to perform visualized their bond with a communal past and a communal future by putting the whole gathering sub specie aeternitatis." <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> "As in the case of sip, the feast of Aiapir may well have been celebrated annually, during the autumn season.

The text includes a series of provisions for regular (monthly) sacrifices of sheep, flour and beer referred to as terru šetru, as well as provisions for several feasts and other occasional offerings (including those before the saparru-wagon of king Tepti-ahar). The amounts for the regular offerings are allocated per two months and divided over six persons, the massarû É.DÙ.A, "Guardians of the (funerary) House,' who 'give' (offer) the sacrificial goods, presumably from a grant founded for this purpose (so Reiner 1973a: 93-4). The institution of regular sacrifices, the possible provision of capital by the crown (in the form of a land grant or serjeanty), and the appointment of six named individuals as executives, altogether translates into a regular income for the 'guardians' taken from the foodstuffs allocated for the sacrifices. As such, Stone Stela 1 provides a parallel for the regular monthly and daily offerings and their human beneficiaries in Persepolis. What comes to mind is lan, but perhaps even more the offerings characterised by the terms šumar and bašur. These offerings involve, like Haft Tepe offerings, <i>groups</i> of executives and relatively high amounts of foodstuffs--the 'guardians' in Stone Stela 1 were probably not the only persons living off

the Middle Elamite period and that were enlarged and still functioning in the Neo-Elamite period, Kul-e Farah is the largest and the one with the most extensive and elaborate visual imagery. The sanctuary is situated in a gorge in the eastern part of the valley of Izeh (Malamir). Most conspicuous are its six reliefs (KF I-VI), depicting various cultic acts and stages in a grand sacrificial feast, carved on the rock faces of the gorge and on three boulders. All are near the entrance to the gorge. One of the reliefs is accompanied by a long Neo-Elamite inscription (EKI 75) and ten short captions (EKI 75A-K). The subjects of the reliefs may be summarized as follows: "KF I (northern face): ruler with two court officials, one carrying (the ruler’s?) bow, quiver, and sword; musicians with harps and drum (?); officiants with a humped bovid and sacrificed rams at an altar; inscription and captions identifying the figures. "KF II (boulder): ruler in praying attitude; attendants and officiants sacrificing a humped bovid and six other animals. "KF III (boulder): ruler lifted on a platform (depicted twice); a host of participants in superimposed registers on both sides marching in procession toward the sacrifice; harp players; sacrificial animals (18 smaller animals, 3 humped bovids). "KF IV (southern face): banquet with seated ruler before table accompanied by attendants and court dignitaries (one carrying bow, quiver, and sword); six harp players and their conductor; numerous participants in registers (on panels left, below, and right of the central relief ) oriented toward the king and lifting their right hands to their mouths (paying homage to the king or eating?); six officiants (?) on the extreme left near the fire-altar or fire bowls (cf. below). "KF V (southern face): ruler in praying attitude followed by his retinue; thymiaterion; officiant slaughtering humped bovid; six more sacrificed animals. "KF VI (boulder): ruler in praying attitude, lifted on a platform, and followed by a short procession of his retinue (one dignitary carrying a quiver); another surface prepared but not used for an additional relief."[...] "There is no agreement among scholars on the date of Kul-e Farah. Some have dated all reliefs to various stages of the Neo-Elamite period, while in more recent studies most are dated to the Middle Elamite period. [...]"[...] "As in the case of sip, the feast of Aiapir may well have been celebrated annually, during the autumn season. This suspicion rests on the assumption that the region of eastern Khuzestan and western Fars is most suitable for agro-pastoralism and on the observation that tribes adapted to that way of life made up, until recently, most of the population in these parts. Within the grand system of migration routes and seasonal pastures in what is commonly known as the Bakhtiari Mountains, the Izeh valley functions as garmsir land and is used as winter residence by the Car Lang. The pastoralists descend to the area in September/October from their summer pastures in the eastern mountains (in the direction of Esfahan) and stay until April/May. Because the autumn rutting season falls in October and lambs from the summer season are born in Novem- ber (cf. Barth 1961: 7), autumn is the best time to reduce the herds by slaughtering or selling the surplus of yearling animals as well as infertile ewes. This has the additional advantage of lowering the need for fodder during the winter season. In the days of Hanni and his predecessors, conditions are likely to have been similar, even though there may have been a more important sedentary segment resident in the valley. It may therefore be expected that the feast of Kul-e Farah took place in autumn.[...] "The central role of the ruler is a prominent feature of both sip and the feast of Aiapir. The fact that the ruler of Aiapir is depicted on all six reliefs in Kul-e Farah and that sacrifices are always performed right in front of him indicate his role as the celebration’s protagonist.[...] "The centrality of the king also found visual expression during the sacrificial feast. At Aiapir, we find the ruler enthroned and surrounded by a multitude of banquet guests who have all turned their faces to him and pay him homage with their gestures (KF I). The king also leads the procession toward the sanctuary (KF III, VI). To accentuate his position even more, the ruler is raised on a platform and carried to the place where the sacrifice takes place. [...] "Not only the position of the ruler but that of every participant found explicit expression at the sacrificial feast. Visible hierarchy was a key element. As De Waele (1972: 2-3; 1989: 34) notes, the Kul-e Farah reliefs are a panorama of an intricate social pyramid in which status is expressed by size, arrangement, closeness to the king, representation in frontal view or in profile, garments, hair-cut, and beard. [...]"[...]"Like sip, the feast at Aiapir may have been a forum at which the king could pay off “debts” by awarding seats of honor to his servants in the local government. That Hanni chose to mention his principal ministers by name in the inscriptions on KF I and that these officials are positioned close to the ruler similarly imply recognition for services rendered. As for the base level of ordinary Aiapirans and workers in the Persepolis economy, the banquets meant access to rare meat rations for larger groups (§6.3.3): a true feast! "The unity of the ruler and his god would of course have been stressed to the maximum during sacrificial feasts such as sip and the one celebrated at Aiapir. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the gods associated with sip or earlier sup are closely connected to the ruler or the dynasty, including Insusinak, Sasum, and Auramazda (§7.1.6). No doubt, Hanni will have adopted a similar attitude vis-à-vis Tirutur. Yet, in the end, neither the king nor the god is the principle participant in the sacrificial feast. That which is celebrated is the community that convenes and reconstitutes itself. Group identity, social hierarchy, and bonds of loyalty are reconfirmed in the sacrifice and the ensuing banquet. This is of special importance in a situation whereby ruler and subjects are separated from each other during large parts of the year. Sedentary and pastoralist Aiapirans, the latter returning from their summer abode, were reunited amid the reliefs of Kul-e Farah, those sublime expressions of their common identity. [...] Traditional hymns played an important role in Persian religious experience (references in Briant 2002: 245, 330), as did music, and, probably, song in Kul-e Farah. Such a musical setting may have served to connect the present to the past and to lift the momentary experience of the feast to a timeless level. At Aiapir, this connection with the past is made tangible in such a way that visiting the site is still a haunting experience. Not only the king and priests, but all members of the community found themselves mirrored on the surrounding reliefs when they entered the gorge for the annual feast. The engraving on the stone of the very ceremony that they were about to perform visualized their bond with a communal past and a communal future by putting the whole gathering sub specie aeternitatis." <sup id="cite_ref-307" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-307">[307]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> "As in the case of sip, the feast of Aiapir may well have been celebrated annually, during the autumn season.

Description of the Normative Ideology ♣  ♥</b> “The elamizing trend continued until the fall of Elam. After his victory at Susa Assurbanipal carried off the statues of nineteen deities, which he listed by name; all had apparently Susan Elamite names. Despite the misleading spellings, the names of several deities are recognizable, including those with the most prestige: Insusinak, Simut, Lagamal, Pinigir, Hutran, and Kirmasir (Aynard, pp. 54-55). “In the Neo-Elamite period, although the principal divinities in the pantheon (Insusinak, Napirisa, Lagamal, Pinigir, Nahhunte, etc.) continued to be honored, lesser known or previously unknown gods came to the fore, among them Masti and Tepti at Malamir, sasum at Kesat, and sati and Lali (among many others) at Susa. The most popular god was Hu(m)ban, who had been mentioned second in the list of gods in the treaty of Naram-Sin. In this period his name appeared as an element in half the royal names and in many other names as well (Scheil, 1907). He did not, however, have a temple at Susa. All these gods were thus essentially Elamite; even the Mesopotamian name of the goddess DIL.BAT, to whom silhak-Insusinak dedicated a temple, could actually have been an epithet for the goddess Masti. [...] The essential role of the gods was to give life, to preserve it as long as possible, and finally to take it back, accompanying the dead to the other world. These different aspects of the divine prerogative can be illustrated by many examples. For example, several cylinder seals found at Coga Zanbil are inscribed “It is for the god (to give) life; it is for the king to save it” (Reiner, 1970b, p. 134). Humban-numena declared that “from the bosom of his mother Napirisa and Insusinak created his name” (Steve, 1987, no. 3). Throughout Elamite history royal dedications show that the kings built temples to protect their own lives and sometimes those of the entire royal family. The simplest formula in such texts is “I, so-and-so, have built such-and-such a sanctuary and, for my life, I have offered it to such-and-such a god.” But more specific requests were addressed to different divinities for a long and favorable and happy reign, for long life, and for a prosperous lineage (Grillot, 1982). “Nevertheless, death seems to have been the principal preoccupation of the Elamites. Most religious buildings were connected with the cult of the dead, and the principal gods were closely associated with the passage of the dead into the next world. [...] Although many gods were associated with the cult of the dead, three played a particularly important role: Insusinak, the weigher of souls, and his two assistants, Isnikarab and Lagamal. A few small funerary tablets (Bottero, pp. 393-401), though very badly preserved, give some idea of the passage into the other world: The dead person, preceded by Isnikarab or Lagamal or both presents himself in the hastu (in the Akkadian texts suttu, a synonym for hastu) before Insusinak, who decides his fate. This scene seems to be illustrated on a number of cylinder seals, where it is commonly identified as a “presentation scene,” even though it is more probably a depiction of the last judgment (Vallat, 1989). [...] Another prerogative of the gods was to confer and protect kingship. Puzur-Insusinak spoke of “the year when Insusinak looked at him (and) gave to him the four regions” (Scheil, 1908, p. 9). It was also Insusinak who conferred kingship upon Humban-numena and the latter’s son Untas-Napirisa (König, nos. 4, no. 13), but it was Manzat who conferred it on Igi-halki (Steve, 1987, no. 2). “In the Elamite pantheon goddesses played a more important role than elsewhere. The enumeration of forty deities in the treaty of Naram-Sin begins with Pinigir, goddess of love and procreation, who was worshiped throughout Elamite history and had an astam, or temple of fertility; she was very frequently represented in art (Spycket, 1992). In addition, various local divinities were goddesses: Kiririsa at Liyan, Upurkupak at Coga Pahn (KS-102) and Gotwand, Masti at Malamir, Manzat at Deh-e Now (q.v.). “The Elamite pantheon was formed from the combination of the pantheons of the principal geopolitical entities that constituted Elam; it is not therefore astonishing that different gods played the same role or possessed the same attributes. Several gods and goddesses had the epithet “great god,” which it is probably correct to understand as “the supreme god”: Insusinak, Napirisa, Humban, Nahhunte, Kiririsa, Manzat, and so on. In addition, several deities were protectors of the gods (Masti, Napir), of kings (Insusinak, Kiririsa, Napir), or of Elam (Silir-katru). Kiririsa and Masti were “mothers of the gods.” Several deities were particularly linked to death by the epithet lahakra (of death): Insusinak, Kiririsa, Upurkupak, and perhaps Ruhuratir and Tepti.” <sup id="cite_ref-349" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-349">[349]</a></sup> In addition to this, according to Henkelman, there was very strong continuity between Elam and Achaemenid Persia, including in terms of ideology: “the Elamite state, both before and after the Assyrian wars, must have been a real Fundgrube for the emergent Persian society and culture in terms of literacy, art, craftsmanship, bureaucracy, royal ideology, military organization, trade networks, administrative mechanisms, and political structure. Persia may indeed be seen as “the heir of Elam” (not of “Media”), to quote Mario Liverani’s provocative comment on the matter (2003: 10; cf. Henkelman 2008a: 4; forthcoming a; forthcoming b).” <sup id="cite_ref-350" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-350">[350]</a></sup> Therefore, some aspects of Elamite ideology may be inferred on the basis of what is known about (Achaemenid) Persian ideology.
