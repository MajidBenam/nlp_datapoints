[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_ItRomRg] In 2014, "The daily Il Messagero quoted Patrizia Fortini, the archaeologist responsible for the Forum, as saying that a wall constructed well before the city's traditional founding date had been unearthed." Examination of ceramic material found beside the wall suggested a date "between the 9th century and the beginning of the 8th century." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]First king of Rome may be Numa Pompilus (716-674 BCE) and a palace found on Palatine Hill dates to the late 8th century BCE.  But was Numa Pompilus really the first king? Romulus, the official founder, was mythical but could be representative of an earlier date (753 BCE?).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Hellenisation of Latium began in the 8th Century. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_ItRomRg] This timeframe (730-580 BCE) was an “orientalising period” marked by increasing social stratification shown by burial evidence of wealth, armour and chariots. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Not a peak date but a notable moment: the period of rule under Etruscan monarchs, beginning with Lucius Tarquinius Priscus from 616 BCE, saw a step-up in hierarchization of the Roman polity, and dates the moment when two groups known as patricians and plebians became more distinguishable. The first paving of the Roman Forum (meeting-place, market and civic centre) occurred around 625-575 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_ItRomRg] The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_ItRomRg] Monumental architecture was present from  the end of the 7th Century[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_ItRomRg] and included a sanctuary constructed in 580 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_ItRomRg] Etruscan monarchs were responsible for large building projects such as the Cloaca Maxima (sewer system), the Circus Maximus and in 535 BCE the last king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (another Etruscan) built the Temple of Jupiter.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Last king is Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (534-509 BCE).

Although there is archaeological evidence for the permanent occupation of Rome from the Iron Age 'centuries before' the city's mythic foundation date of 754 BCE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_ItRomRg] perhaps from as early as 1000 BCE,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_ItRomRg] we have chosen to begin this polity in 716, with the traditional death date of the city's legendary founder Romulus.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_ItRomRg] The city prospered during this time, which saw the development of many of the institutions - political administration, legal system, religious practices - characteristic of the later Roman Republic. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (534-509 BCE), was expelled from Rome for his and his family's tyrannical excesses. In his place, the leading Roman elites established an aristocratic city-state, ushering in the Republican period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]By end of the Regal Period, Rome was a well-developed city-state, boasting civic infrastructure (marsh drainage, roads), political institutions (assemblies, Senate), monuments (temples), and a powerful military. It held at least one third of the area of Latium vetus (Old Latium)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_ItRomRg] and had a population of 20,000-50,000 people.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]According to legend, Rome became a city when the eponymous founder Romulus slew his twin brother Remus, both outcasts from a nearby Latium settlement, in a contest over where to found their new city. Numa Pompilius (r. 715-673 BCE), of Sabine origin, was the next king. Pompilius is traditionally credited with establishing 'all the major religious institutions of the state, including the calendar and the priesthoods'.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_ItRomRg] Starting with Tarquinius Priscus (r. 616-579 BCE), Rome was ruled by a series of kings of Etruscan descent, who could thus draw on the legacy of this powerful and complex culture from north-central Italy (around modern-day Etruria). The Roman king served as chief legislator, military commander, highest judge and chief priest.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_ItRomRg] Archaeological remains found on the Palatine Hill dating to the late 8th century BCE suggest that the king lived in a palace from the earliest times. Rome's relationship with other settlements in Latium, particularly on military matters, were important.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_ItRomRg] The hereditary clan system (<i>gens</i>) formed the basis of the Roman nobility,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_ItRomRg] likely serving first as the king's advisors, although administrative structures gradually became more institutionalized (for example, through the establishment of a formal senate and voting assemblies) throughout the late 8th and 7th centuries BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The city of Rome, with a population somewhere between 14,000 and 57,000 during this period, fared well in military and economic terms. Several kings claimed important victories over nearby settlements in Latium and Etruria, expanding Rome's sphere of influence and establishing economic connections throughout central Italy. The Via Salaria ('salt road') and the Sacra Via in Rome were in existence from the beginning of the Roman Kingdom[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_ItRomRg] - although at this time the roads would not have been paved. A port known as Caere was situated 50 kilometres northwest of Rome.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_ItRomRg] The first bridge, thought to be the Pons Sublicius, may have been built in 642 BCE under Ancus Marcius.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_ItRomRg] Roman kings also reclaimed marshland and carried out drainage works.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_ItRomRg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>This polity was coded early, was the target of dedicated workshops, and had many experts look over it.

On the basis of urban area, and a roughly proportional decrease based on Modelksi's 509 BCE estimate (we should remember that as cities acquire more area they generally acquire greater population density), we could infer a population in the region of 15,000-25,000 for 700 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The highest officers in the Roman military system were not professionals.

The old Roman treasury - the aerarium Saturni - was housed in the basement of the Temple of Saturn [MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_ItRomRg]  The state treasury of the Roman Republic was kept in the custody of the priesthood inside the temple of Saturn, and was managed by elected aristocratic officials called quaestors.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_ItRomRg] Work on this temple is only thought to have been begun by the last king of the Regal Period, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. During the Roman Kingdom, therefore, the treasury must have been held somewhere else; one might speculate within the court of the monarch.

Sparacello’s work on the same assemblage makes a compelling, if not conclusive, case that unusually high levels of asymmetric development of the upper limbs among the males in this population resulted from habitual training with the weaponry interred with them (Sparacello et al. 2011)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_206_ItRomRg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Mass burials ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not mentioned by sources consulted.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement destruction ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Not mentioned by sources consulted.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Pictorial evidence of warfare ♣ present ♥</b> Not mentioned by sources consulted.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="List_of_Wars">List of Wars</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=ItRomRg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38" title="Edit section: List of Wars">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div>Sabines[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Albans[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Fidenates[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Veientes[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Veii[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Volsci[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Gabii[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Rutuli</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣  ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=ItRomRg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ feriae Latinae ♥</b> "One can reconstruct a story therefore in which from a very early point in time, perhaps the ninth century BC, peoples of Latium came together at Alba Longa for a festival.

Although many of these holy places had been the centres of cult activity from a very early period, it was the sixth century that witnessed a widespread process of monumental development, in some cases leading to the construction of temples" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_245_ItRomRg]. Several of these sanctuary-temples have been found in Rome, but also at sites such as Veii, Orvietum, Lanuvium, Ardea and Satricum, "often with evidence of earlier cult activity" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_ItRomRg]. Some sanctuaries were located inside city walls, others outside. Several extra-mural sanctuary-temples have been excavated at Pratica di Mare (ancient Lavinium), and "[o]ne, on the eastern side of the city walls, has yielded large numbers of terracotta offerings in a votive deposit extending from the sixth to the fourth century BC, including over sixty large-scale statues, at least four of them representing Minerva" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_247_ItRomRg]. Another sanctuary-temple at Lavinium yielded a row of thirteen stone altars, suggesting that "several Latin communities each maintained its own altar, just as the Greek cities had their individual treasuries at Delphi" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_248_ItRomRg]. "Although all religious shrines in archaic Italy seem to have been 'international' in the sense that they were offered, and were prepared to accept, dedications from all comers (no doubt on condition that they had money and/or high status), it appears that the extra-urban sanctuaries were established for the specific purpose of attracting outsiders, and inviting other communities to participate in joint celebrations" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_249_ItRomRg].

the temple of Saturn, and afterward there was a huge banquet to which everyone was invited. The rest of the week was taken up with non-stop parties and feasts. All shops, law courts, and schools were closed. Normal moral restraints were loosened and everyone was expected to engage in all forms of revelry and fun. This was the only time of year when people were legally allowed to gamble in public. Bands of revelers ran through the streets drinking and shouting 'lo Saturnalia.' "Some of the customs of this festival involved inversions in status. Thus, for one day of the week, slaves were treated as equals, and often at the banquet that day, masters would wait on their slaves and serve them their food. During the festival, everyone wore liberty caps, symbolizing either that for the moment everyone was equal or that everyone was expected to behave with freedom and abandon. Each family would select a princeps, or "leader," of the Saturnalia, who presided over the parties. Often this was someone normally of low status, such as a child. Another custom of the Saturnalia was exchanging gifts. People gave dolls made out of clay to children and wax candles to their friends." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_342_ItRomRg] NB This is a description of how this festival would have been celebrated in much later times--descriptions of earlier versions of the festival could not be found. Moreover, the Vinalia and Parilia festivals would also have featured euphoric elements [MAJIDBENAM_REF_343_ItRomRg], but the Saturnalia appears to be better known.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The 17th of December [MAJIDBENAM_REF_344_ItRomRg].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> The 17th of December [MAJIDBENAM_REF_345_ItRomRg]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> The 17th of December [MAJIDBENAM_REF_346_ItRomRg] <span> Thomas Cressy: Changed from 'yearly' to 'not applicable' to fit the inclusiveness codes." </span></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ [12-18] ♥</b> hours. 1 day.

[...] <i>Lemures</i> is another term for the dead. It is thought to denote a 'terrifying and malicious' ghost. [...] Ovid says that the ritual takes place at midnight, and the worshipper, commonly identified as the <i>Paterfamilias</i>, rises. He goes barefoot, and makes a 'sign with his thumb in the middle of his closed fingers', and washes his hands. He then accepts black beans, turns his face away, and throws them away.

However, the monarch's relationship to the people was seen as similar or identical to the power a father had over his household; in other words, the Roman monarchy was strictly patriarchal. The relationship between a patriarch and his family is a relationship of mutual obligations, and this is how the Romans understood the monarchy. In early Roman society, however, the father exercised incredible authority over the family. The father could sell his children into slavery (or could kill them if he could justify it). This arbitrary power was limited: before a father sold or killed his children, he was required to consult with the family and with the public. While the father was not allowed to kill or sell his wife, he was allowed to divorce her; this was allowed, however, only in the most extreme circumstances. In addition, the father served as the priest of the family. In many ways, the Roman monarch followed this model of power: absolute but limited by the people, their welfare, and tradition.

An apparent feature of this social process in Rome "and Latium more generally" was the emergence of "two distinct groups"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_466_ItRomRg]: a "gens-based aristocracy and the settled, proto-urban and urban populations".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_467_ItRomRg] The settled population initiated developments as it was likely present before the mobile, tribal aristocracy: its curiate system of government is thought to have "represented the archaic urban settlement of Rome".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_468_ItRomRg] Some consider early Rome similar to a Greek polis[MAJIDBENAM_REF_469_ItRomRg] but this Hellenistic influence should not be confused with a (presumably separate) "Hellenization of Rome" which occurred in the late fourth, early third BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_470_ItRomRg] The earliest polity had an assembly with senior magistrates[MAJIDBENAM_REF_471_ItRomRg] and is considered a Kingdom (with local Latin or Sabine kings) lack of evidence means precise details are not available and conclusions are somewhat guesswork.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]An important point is that "the urban community at Rome may have begun to develop a distinct, community-based identity from the eighth century onwards"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_472_ItRomRg] well before it acquired the institutions for which it became famous. Certainly, however, by 6th CE the distinctive Roman polity that was to be the basis of the Roman Republic was beginning to form. The period of Etruscan monarchs, beginning with Lucius Tarquinius Priscus from 616 BCE, appears to represent the time of an additional step-up in hierarchization of the Roman polity, when its two constituent groups (to be known as patricians and plebians) became ever more distinguishable. The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_473_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The late Roman Kingdom saw the first paving of the Roman Forum around 625-575 BCE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_474_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_REF_475_ItRomRg] as well as large building projects such as the Cloaca Maxima, Circus Maximus and the Temple of Jupiter. Following Etruscan king Priscus, king Servius Tullius instituted some revolutionary reforms which included a new legislative assembly that cemented the power of the aristocracy. In addition to the comitia curiata which was likely "a purely patrician body"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_476_ItRomRg] he "created the form of suffrage known as the comitia centuriata, a method of voting based on property qualification: i. e., in the comitia centuriata all Roman citizens voted; but their votes were grouped in classes according to their property holding."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_477_ItRomRg] In this comitia centuriata, which was probably was the legislature of the late Roman Kingdom (as it was later in the early Republic), votes were "proportionate to wealth."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_478_ItRomRg] In terms of the flora of state institutions in the Late Roman Kingdom we have "an executive, priestly and judicial head, the Rex or king; his cabinet or advisory council, the Senatus, or Senate".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_479_ItRomRg] The priesthood and top juditical authority was not at this time separate from the executive. There certainly was no central bureaucracy either - this did not emerge in the Roman world until the Roman Principate when salaried officials worked in the Imperial Bureaux (scrinia)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_480_ItRomRg], although king Servius Tullius - presumably with the resources of his court - managed to administer the first census of Rome. During the Republic period the state treasury was held in the temple of Saturn, controlled by elected quaestors under the supervision of the Senate[MAJIDBENAM_REF_481_ItRomRg] but this building did not exist during the Roman Kingdom so probably neither did elected quaestors. Usually dated to c500 BCE, work on the temple of Saturn is thought to have been begun by the last king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. If the Roman Kingdom had a treasury it must have been held somewhere else at this time; one might speculate within the court of the monarch.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Prestige of state-level bureaucracy ♣ equal ♥</b>  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_482_ItRomRg][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Authority over state-level administrators</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Direct ♣ absent ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Indirect ♣ present ♥</b> the 753-509 BCE period saw the increasing hierarchization of the Roman polity.

For all the accounts we have of Rome's earliest history are found in writers (Dionysius amongst them) who lived in the first Century B.C. or later - more than 600 years after the dates usually given to the reigns of Romulus and Numa. None of our sources is contemporary with the events they describe. Nor could their authors have read any such contemporary accounts on which to base their own: so far as we know, there were no writers in earliest, regal Rome; there was no account left by Numa, say, of his religious foundations. [...] Judged by our own Standards of historical 'accuracy', these ancient accounts of early Rome and its religion are inadequate and misleading; they construct an image of a relatively sophisticated society, more like the city of the first Century B. C. than the hamlet of the eighth Century. Projections of the contemporary world back into the distant past, they are more myth than history. " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_599_ItRomRg] "Recent work, particularly in archaeology, has cast doubt on the idea of an early, uncontaminated, native strand of genuine Roman religion; and it has suggested that, rather than seeing pure Roman traditions gradually polluted from outside, Roman religion was an amalgam of different traditions from at least as far back as we can hope to go. Leaving aside its mythical prehistory, Roman religion was always already multicultural." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_600_ItRomRg] "Much of the evidence for the early history of the Roman gods remains tantalizing. But it is possible to offer a rough outline of their place in the life of Rome: closely involved in the political and military activity of the city, they are seen as forces outside the human Community with whom the man of learning and skill, knowing the rules, traditions and rituals, can negotiate and communicate (and if necessary assuage); the activities of the city's leaders on the city's behalf could hardly be conceived except in the context of such a procedure of negotiation and Joint action; divine benevolence (secured by human effort) was essential to the success of the State; Rome's history in other words was determined by the actions of men and gods together."
