In 946 CE the Caliph lost autonomy when it was taken over by the Daylamite Buyids, reducing the Caliphate to a nominal figurehead of the Islamic world. This resulted also in the loss of an independent military. The Caliph still retained prestige and could influence legitimacy in its former territory.  In 1258 CE Baghdad, the capital, was sacked by the Mongols and this extinguished the last vestigial  power of the Abbasid Dynasty, although the Abbasid Caliphate was restored in Cairo in 1261.

To secure his rule, Abu al-'Abbass al-Saffah sought to destroy the male line descending from Fatima and Ali,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_IqAbbs1] and had about 300 members of the Umayyad family killed.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IqAbbs1] The last 80 Umayyads were tricked into attending a banquet with their hosts in Damascus and massacred there.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IqAbbs1] (One twenty-year-old prince, Abd al-Rahman, famously managed to escape this fate: he dodged assassins all the way to Spain, where he founded an Umayyad Emirate). The First Abbasid Caliphate Period ended in 946 CE when the Daylamite Buyids from northwestern Iran reduced the caliph to a nominal figurehead. Ironically, given the bloody manner in which the dynasty began, the final Abbasid caliph was rolled up in his own carpet and trampled to death by Mongol horsemen in 1258 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IqAbbs1] The zenith of the Abbasid period is considered to be the reign of Harun al Rashid (763-809 CE), whose rule is described in <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_IqAbbs1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The capital of the Abbasid Caliphate eventually settled at Baghdad, but in the earlier years the central administration was run from Kufa (750-762 CE), Al-Raqqah (796-809 CE), Merv (810-819 CE),[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_IqAbbs1] and Samarra (836-870 CE).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_IqAbbs1][MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_IqAbbs1] The Abbasid caliph, spiritual leader of the Sunni Muslim world and commander-in-chief of its army, left the day-to-day administration to his vizier and heads of the diwans in the complex bureaucracy.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The departments were divided into three main areas of responsibility: the chancery (<i>diwan-al-rasa'il</i>); tax collection (<i>diwan al-kharif</i>); and army administration (<i>diwan al-jaysh</i>).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_IqAbbs1] Professional officials and soldiers were paid both in cash and in kind.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_IqAbbs1] The task of organizing the 'collection and payment of revenues' fell to the Abbasid military.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_IqAbbs1] However, while it was a professional institution, it lacked a rigid hierarchy or a well-defined officer class.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_IqAbbs1] Below the caliph himself, the top military rulers were the provincial governors in Iraq, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syria, Western Iran and Khuzistan. In Iraq and Egypt, local government was divided into a hierarchy of districts, with subdivisions (<i>kura</i>, <i>tassuj</i> and <i>rustaq</i>) used for assessing taxation, which was passed to the governor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_IqAbbs1] Within the Abbasid Caliphate there were also relatively independent vassals, who were required to pay tribute to the central government at Baghdad.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_IqAbbs1] The law code was based largely on <i>sharia</i> law and the <i>ijma' </i>(legal opinions of religious scholars).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_IqAbbs1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Abbasid state provided centres of medical care, built ornate public markets, often with drinking fountains, and furnished welfare for the poor.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_29_IqAbbs1] As paper technology diffused from China, libraries became a common fixture in the cities of the caliphate. In Baghdad, the Khizanat al-Hikma, or 'treasury of wisdom', became a refuge for scholars, providing access to a large collection as well as free lodgings and board.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_IqAbbs1] Each important city included an official called the <i>saheb al-sorta</i>, who was responsible for maintaining public order, and the <i>amir al-suq</i>, in charge of regulating the bazaar.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IqAbbs1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The territory possessed by the caliphate was lost in dramatic fashion, shrinking from 11.1 million square kilometres in 750 CE, to 4.6 million around 850 CE, to just 1 million square kilometres half a century later as Egypt, Afghanistan and Central Asia were all lost.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_32_IqAbbs1] Nevertheless, in 900 CE the core region of Abbasid control in the Middle East still had a substantial population of about 10 million people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_33_IqAbbs1] Over 300,000 (or maybe 900,000) of these lived in Baghdad,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_34_IqAbbs1] which by this date had probably outgrown Byzantine Constantinople.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate name ♣ Abbasid Caliphate ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefiles ♣ AbbasidCaliphate_800CE: 750CE-899CE; AbbasidCaliphate_900CE: 900CE-946CE ♥</b>  AbbasidCaliphate_800CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_35_IqAbbs1] AbbasidCaliphate_900CE:[MAJIDBENAM_REF_36_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate shapefile area ♣  8788161: 750CE-899CE; 877973: 900CE-946CE ♥</b> squared kilometers using projection epsg:6933</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language Genus ♣ Semitic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Language ♣ Arabic ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Family ♣ Sunni Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Religion Sect ♣ Hanafi ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religious Tradition ♣ Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Macrostate Alternate Religion Family ♣ Shia Islam ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Stephen Dean; Edward A L Turner ♥</b> <i>these codes were reviewed at Seshat Workshops, Oxford 2016 and 2017</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=IqAbbs1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 8,300,000: 800 CE; 1,000,000: 900 CE ♥</b> kilometers squared. 11,100,000: 750 CE; 8,300,000: 800 CE; 4,600,000: 850 CE; 1,000,000: 900 CE; 200,000: 946 CE  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_37_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ [23,000,000-33,000,000]: 800 CE; [9,000,000-11,000,000]: 900 CE ♥</b> persons.[MAJIDBENAM_BR][23,000,000-33,000,000]: 750-799 CE  <i>ET: is this expert disagreement or a range?

Each of these also their own internal structures with soldiers recruited from Syria using older Byzantine ranks, whereas mercenary tribes recruited from North Africa or Central Asia served under their clan leaders. There were also differences depending of where the individuals were serving. Permanent garrisons differed from temporary soldiers used for a campaign.

Some of the "grenades" were astoundingly similar in size and shape to those used in modern times: round iron - or clay - jars which contained the flammable mixture and exploded shortly after the lids were opened."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_158_IqAbbs1]  Persians threw vessels filled with sulphur, asphalt and naphtha into the enemy bulwarks. The first mention of the common place use of naphtha as an incendiary device in the annals of Islam is in connection with a raid in India in 777. During the siege of Heraklia in 803, however, stone balls wrapped in linen and covered with burning naphtha were hurled by mangonels against the ramparts. The fire would cling to the stones and cause them to burst. From that time onwards, the caliphate employed corps of naphtha-throwers and the Muslim fleets were provided with it as well. In order to protect themselves, people covered flammable materials with newly flayed animal skins and those who handled the naphtha wore clothes saturated with talc.

The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba. Furthermore, it is important to remember that almost all reform movements in the fringe areas of the Islamic world were triggered off by the pilgrimage. Faithful believers from Bengal and Nigeria, from Morocco and Central Asia, who had lived for some time in Mecca and exchanged their views with others who, like them, had experienced what seemed to be the 'true Arabic Islam', returned to their Page 39countries to fight the numerous indigenous superstitions and customs which had infiltrated the Islam of the masses and which now appeared to them like remnants of ancient paganism."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, although "a pilgrim can start going into consecration (<i>ihram</i>) for Hajj earlier, from the beginning of the tenth month (Shawwal)".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_247_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_248_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> The inhabitants of Mecca, Medina and other important waypoints along the pilgrimage may be considered as "passive spectators or witnesses", as the Seshat codebook puts it.

It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque).

It appears, however, that a carnival increasingly became its main function. The people drank wine and beer; there were those who ambushed travelers and sprayed them with filthy water or wine, and others threw eggs on one another. Even emirs and dignitaries were exposed to this sort of ridicule, and, to rescue themselves, they had to pay 'ransom.' Slapping one another with boots or leather mats in public places was possibly a remnant of a pagan ritual. Sexual overtones were expressed in the play of water games, causing men and women to become wet so that naked bodies could be seen through clothes. In 1188, the public gathering of transvestites and prostitutes is reported. Masquerades are reported during the celebration of 975. Puritan scholars of the Mamluk period lamented the adverse effect of the festival on both the common people and the learned. They reported that schools were shut down and turned into playgrounds and that teachers were insulted and sprayed with water. These writers found it detestable that the participants were able 'to commit all kinds of evil,' that 'there was no interdiction [to any sort of behavior] and no authority imposed.' "The high mark of Nawruz in medieval Cairo was the procession of the Emir of Nawruz, usually a wanton who was either naked or dressed in colorful clothes, his face besmeared with lime or flour and a beard of fur attached to his face, on his head a special cap made of palm leaves, riding a donkey in the streets. He held a sort of register in his hand, 'visited' homes of dignitaries to collect 'debts,' and punished those who refused to pay. Manifest in this procession is the carnivalesque element of status reversal and riotous revelry a ́la medieval Christian festivals such as the King of Fools."

The scene reminds Muslims of the gathering on the Day of Judgement. If any pilgrim misses this event, his/her Hajj is not valid and has to be done again another year. This does not apply to any other rite, all of which can be done over a longer period or compensated for with an offering. This is the time for the pilgrims to read the Qur’an, glorify God and pray most earnestly for forgiveness and everything else they wish for. Particularly recommended for glorification and repetition is this prayer, ‘There is no God but Allah alone, with no partner. Dominion and praise belong to Him, who gives life and death. Goodness is in His hands and He has power over everything.’ This just gives a succinct summary of the Islamic faith and connects the individual pilgrim to what Ibrahim and Muhammad brought and uttered. Pilgrims normally face towards the Ka‘ba while reciting these prayers, as they do for the five daily prayers, believing that, by doing this, their prayers are more likely to be accepted.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_400_IqAbbs1]. This ritual is coded here as dysphoric due to the fact that pilgrims are required to stand for several hours (between noon and sunset) under the sun’s heat. A contemporary account, dating to 1997, notes that the “heat is virtually unbearable” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_401_IqAbbs1]. However, it is worth noting that, due to peculiarities of the Islamic calendar, this ritual may sometimes be performed at a time of the year when the temperature is less hot than at other times, and when there are fewer others between noon and sunset than at other times. Moreover, a few informal online sources suggest that those who cannot stand in the sun for the duration of the ritual are allowed to be in the shade and/or sit down. Still, though relatively mild, this appears to be the most dysphoric ritual within Sunni Islam.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar [MAJIDBENAM_REF_402_IqAbbs1].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> Every Muslim should undertake the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_403_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 6 ♥</b> hours, on average.

Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded.

Women, aside from a minority in the upper classes, often did not have the wherewithal or time free from domestic obligations to pursue such an education.

The teacher would read the text aloud, and the student would listen and review his own copy to ensure accurate transmission. The requirement of face-to-face pedagogy, however, collided with cultural and religious norms dictating against interaction between men and women who were not related to each other by marriage or within specified degrees of kinship (maḥram). Furthermore, during the second/eighth and third/ninth centuries, scholars advocated that students begin studying ḥadīth (i.e., seeking traditions from different ḥadīth masters) only after demonstrating a good command of Arabic and the ability to memorize and convey texts accurately. According to the fourth-century ḥadīth scholar al-Rāmahurmuzī (d. ca. 360/970), Baṣrans encouraged the start of the study of ḥadīth around the age of ten, Kūfans around the age of twenty, and Syrians around the age of thirty. Following these recommendations, girls or young women who wished to excel in this arena would have had to begin pursuing their studies around the onset of puberty and/or during their child-bearing years.

They were viewed as a sign of status for their owners and were also exchanged as gifts to maintain alliances between rulers and among different kinds of elites.8 Although such slaves during the first centuries of Islam were educated in Medina and other centers, Basra appears to have become the center of their education during the Abbasid period. Their owners hosted cultural salons that often included different kinds of elites so that the owner and the educated female slave each had the opportunity to build networks. Thus, it is not surprising that educated female slaves sometimes rose to positions of power. At this time, education involved, in large part, the Arabic language, Quran, poetry, and music. Their role in entertainment contributed to the expansion of women’s education in general.9 Regulations for slavery in general and for concubines in particular, as well as social practices that valorized women’s education in what we know as the humanities, led to developments in women’s subjectivity and human rights within the exploitative context of slave labor."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_519_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all social classes ♣ ♥</b> The sources consulted do not confirm whether or not enslaved people could own property.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Discrimination on the basis of ethnicity/race</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Bureaucratic positions are open to people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ yes ♥</b> "Above all, the Abbasids succeeded in founding their state on the chief characteristic of an Islamic system via, equality, liberty, fraternity, social justice and toleration.

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women.

Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_593_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ other supernatural enforcement ♣ present ♥</b> The most important Islamic virtue that is not captured by other variables appears to be mercy. "Mercy encompasses kindness to animals as well as to humans, for abuse or cruelty of any of God's creatures is abhorrent to their creator. Such virtues are stressed again and again in the Qur'an and in the Prophet's sayings, as in the following hadith, for example: ‘God will not show mercy to him who does not show mercy to others.'"

These religious agents may be acting independently of the state, or as its representatives. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016). In general, we are contrasting enforcement of “moral”/”prosocial” behaviours directed between humans with that of “amoral”/“procedural” behaviours directed by humans towards supernatural beings (e.g., prayers, rituals, sacrifices, taboos).</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to care for the needy. "Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_595_IqAbbs1] "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_596_IqAbbs1] "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_597_IqAbbs1] "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_598_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement of fairness ♣ present ♥</b> Islam prohibits cheating in trade. "Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with even scales (<i>when you weigh</i>). This is better, and will be the best in the end. [...](Qur'an, 17:31- 7)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_599_IqAbbs1] Moreover, justice is one of the key Islamic virtues: <i>In all their dealings, Muslims are required to stand firmly for justice even if it be against themselves or their kith and kin: 'O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_600_IqAbbs1] However, it's worth noting that "the adulteration of weights and measures" belonged to the domain of "non-Quranic law"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_601_IqAbbs1].</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement of human reciprocity ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement of property rights ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft. Traditional Islamic penal ordinances (hudud) distinguish between two kinds: al-sariqah al-sughra (simple theft), requiring amputation of the right hand, and al-sariqah al-kubra, the meaning of which is contested but which requires the amputation of the right hand and left foot. Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty. Hudud ordinances are considered primarily deterrant and, due to their strict evidentiary requirements, are rarely invoked." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_602_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement of kinship obligations ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to be kind to one's parents: <i>Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you show kindness to your parents.

And lower unto them the wing of humility and tenderness and say: 'Lord, be merciful to them both, as they did care for me when I was small.' Your Lord best knows what is in your minds. If you are righteous, He surely was ever Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). [...](17:23- 9)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_603_IqAbbs1] In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void. [...] Other needy family members, such as parents, grandparents and grandchildren, may also claim a right to maintenance[...]."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_604_IqAbbs1]</i></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement of in-group loyalty♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement of respect♣ present ♥</b> "Classical Islamic constitutional law was concerned particularly with the issue of the legitimacy of leadership. The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are. Classical commentaries name secular rulers (umara' , sultan) as well as religious ahl al-qur'an wa-l-'ilm) or legal scholars (fuqaha'). "[MAJIDBENAM_REF_605_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement of bravery♣ present ♥</b> "Beginning with the classical texts on Islamic law a fundamental bipartition of the world was evolved which would remain - with some modifications - the basis of all deliberation until well into the twentieth century. The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_606_IqAbbs1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ human religious enforcement of purity♣ present ♥</b> "Modesty or chastity is also an important virtue in the Islamic system of morality for all Muslims, men or women. To the true Muslim, man and woman alike, anything impure or degrading is abhorrent and to be avoided.

The most famous personal example of chastity in the Qur'an is the Virgin Mary: 'And (<i>remember that blessed woman</i>) who guarded her chastity' (21:91)."
