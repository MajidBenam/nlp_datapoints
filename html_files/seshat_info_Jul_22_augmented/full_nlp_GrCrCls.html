The Great Code record laws related to inheritance, ownership of slaves, rape and adultery, matters of childhood, divorce and widowhood, and sale and mortgaging of land. The legislation make clear distinctions between the different social classes (free Cretan citizens, serf, slaves and foreigners). The absence of other legislative texts set this inscription aside as a unique source for the study of the economy and society of Cretan cities. <b>The Great Code</b>  <b>I</b>. Whoever intends to bring suit in relation to a free man or slave, shall not take action by seizure before trial; but if he do seize him, let the judge fine him ten staters for the free man, five for the slave, and let him release him within three days. But if he do not release him, let the judge sentence him to a stater for a free man, a drachma for a slave, each day until he has released him. But if he deny that he made the seizure, the judge shall decide with oath, unless a witness testify. If one party contend that he is a free man, the other that he is a slave, those who testify that he is free shall be preferred. But if they testify either for both parties or for neither of the two, the judge shall render his decision by oath. But if the slave on account of whom the defendant was defeated take refuge in a temple, the defendant, summoning the plaintiff in the presence of two witnesses of age and free, shall point out the slave at the temple; but if he do not issue the summons or do not point him out, he shall pay what is written. And if he do not return him, even within the year, he shall pay in addition to the sums stated one-fold. But if he die while the suit is progressing, he shall pay his value one-fold. <b>II</b>. If one commit rape on a free man or woman, he shall pay 100 staters, and if on the son or daughter of an apetairos ten, and if a slave on a free man or woman, he shall pay double, and if a free man on a male or female serf five drachmas, and if a serf on a male or female serf, five staters. If one debauch a female house-slave by force he shall pay two staters, but if one already debauched, in the daytime, an obol, but if at night, two obols. If one tries to seduce a free woman, he shall pay ten staters, if a witness testify. . . <b>III</b>. If one be taken in adultery with a free woman in her father=s, brother=s, or husband=s house, he shall pay 100 staters, but if in another=s house, fifty; and with the wife of an apetairos, ten. But if a slave with a free woman, he shall pay double, but if a slave with a slave's wife, five. . .<b>IV</b>. If a husband and wife be divorced, she shall have her own property that she came with to her husband, and the half of the income if it be from her own property, and whatever she has woven, the half, whatever it may be, and five staters, if her husband be the cause of her dismissal; but if the husband deny that he was the cause, the judge shall decide. . . <b>V</b>. If a man die, leaving children, if his wife wish, she may marry, taking her own property and whatever her husband may have given her, according to what is written, in the presence of three witnesses of age and free. But if she carry away anything belonging to her children she shall be answerable. And if he leaves her childless, she shall have her own property and whatever she has woven, the half, and of the produce on hand in possession of the heirs, a portion, and whatever her husband has given her as is written. If a wife shall die childless, the husband shall return to her heirs her property, and whatever she has woven the half, and of the produce, if it be from her own property, the half. If a female serf be separated from a male serf while alive or in case of his death, she shall have her own property, but if she carry away anything else she shall be answerable. <b>VI</b>. If a woman bear a child while living apart from her husband after divorce, she shall have it conveyed to the husband at his house, in the presence of three witnesses; if he do not receive the child, it shall be in the power of the mother to bring up or expose. . . <b>VII</b>. The father shall have power over his children and the division of the property, and the mother over her property. As long as they live, it shall not be necessary to make a division. But if a father die, the houses in the city and whatever there is in the houses in which a serf residing in the country does not live, and the sheep and the larger animals which do not belong to the serf, shall belong to the sons; but all the rest of the property shall be divided fairly, and the sons, howsoever many there be, shall receive two parts each, and the daughters one part each. The mother's property also shall be divided, in case she dies, as is written for the father's. And if there should be no property but a house, the daughters shall receive their share as is written. And if a father while living may wish to give to his married daughter, let him give according to what is written, but not more. . . <b>X</b>. As long as a father lives, no one shall purchase any of his property from a son, or take it on mortgage; but whatever the son himself may have acquired or inherited, he may sell if he will; nor shall the father sell or pledge the property of his children, whatever they have themselves acquired or succeeded to, nor the husband that of his wife, nor the son that of the mother. . . If a mother die leaving children, the father shall be trustee of the mother's property, but he shall not sell or mortgage unless the children assent, being of age; and if anyone shall otherwise purchase or take on pledge the property, it shall still belong to the children; and to the purchaser or pledgor the seller or pledgee shall pay two-fold the value in damages. But if he wed another, the children shall have control of the mother's property. <b>XI</b>. If a slave going to a free woman shall wed her, the children shall be free; but if the free woman to a slave, the children shall be slaves; and if from the same mother free and slave children be born, if the mother die and there be property, the free children shall have it; otherwise her free relatives shall succeed to it. <b>XIV</b>. The heiress shall marry the brother of the father, the eldest of those living; and if there be more heiresses and brothers of the father, they shall marry the eldest in succession. . . But if he do not wish to marry the heiress, the relatives of the heiress shall charge him and the judge shall order him to marry her within two months; and if he do not marry, she shall marry the next eldest. If she do not wish to marry, the heiress shall have the house and whatever is in the house, but sharing the half of the remainder, she may marry another of her tribe, and the other half shall go to the eldest. . .<b>XVI</b>.A son may give to a mother or a husband to a wife 100 staters or less, but not more; if he should give more, the relatives shall have the property. If anyone owing money, or under obligation for damages, or during the progress of a suit, should give away anything, unless the rest of his property be equal to the obligation, the gift shall be null and void. One shall not buy a man while mortgaged until the mortgagor release him. <b>XVII</b>.Adoption may take place whence one will; and the declaration shall be made in the market-place when the citizens are gathered. If there be no legitimate children, the adopted shall received all the property as for legitimates. If there be legitimate children, the adopted son shall receive with the males the adopted son shall have an equal share. If the adopted son shall die without legitimate children, the property shall return to the pertinent relatives of the adopter. A woman shall not adopt, nor a person under puberty. <b>XVIII</b>. Whatever is written for the judge to decide according to witnesses or by oath of denial, he shall decide as is written, but touching other matters shall decide under oath according to matters in controversy. If a son have given property to his mother, or a husband to his wife, as was written before these writings, it shall not be illegal; but hereafter gifts shall be made as here written. <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Crete owes much of its fame in Classical Greece to its internal organization and its cultivation of the laws.

He said that "What people call peace, in Crete is simply a word, as an undeclared war is the natural reality of the cities of Crete". Τhe rivality between powerful city-states was a constant source of tension, either between them or among weaker city-states. The main cause of antagonism was the need for territorial expansion, a need that was particularly pressing for cities whose economy was based on agropastoral production. Conflicts intensified from the end of the Archaic period (end of the 6th century BCE), when land began to be concentrated into a few hands and demands by landless farmers for its redistribution intensified. The expansionist tendencies of Knossos, the most powerful city-state on the island, led to many military conflicts. Its primacy is discerned in many treaties - that with Tylissos in 450 BC, for instance - setting out the terms of joint military operations and distribution of spoils. City-states from the rest of Greece also participated in the disputes, either as arbiters (Argos) or in support of a particular Cretan city (Sparta). Archaeological evidence of contemporary military technology in Crete is very limited; however, the Cretans had undoubtedly adopted a military technology similar to that of the city-states of Classical Greece. <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> On the other hand, we do have a wealth of information on citizens’ training and martial skills. Strabo, mentioning the work of Ephorus of Cyme, reports that:  “With respect to the form of government, which Ephorus has described at large, it will be sufficient to give a cursory account of the principal parts. The law-giver, says Ephorus, seems to lay, as the foundation of his constitution, the greatest good that states can enjoy, namely, liberty; for it is this alone which makes the property of every kind which a man possesses his own; in a state of slavery it belongs to the governor, and not to the governed. The liberty also which men enjoy must be guarded. Unanimity ensues, when the dissensions that arise from covetousness and luxury are removed. Now where all live temperately and frugally, neither envy, nor injuries, nor hatred have place among equals. Whence the young were enjoined to repair to the Agelae, and those of mature age to assemble at the Syssitia, or common meals, called Andreia, in order that the poorer sort, who were fed at the public charge, might partake of the same fare as the rich. With a view that courage, and not fear, should predominate, they were accustomed from childhood to the use of arms, and to endure fatigue. Hence they disregarded heat and cold, rugged and steep roads, blows received in gymnastic exercises and in set battles. They practised archery, and the dance in armour, which the Curetes first invented, and was afterwards perfected by Pyrrhichus, and called after him Pyrrhiche. Hence even their sports were not without their use in their training for war. With the same intention they used the Cretan measures in their songs; the tones of these measures are extremely loud; they were invented by Thales, to whom are ascribed the pæans and other native songs and many of their usages. They adopted a military dress also, and shoes, and considered armor as the most valuable of all presents." <sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> Cretans were brave warriors and famed archers. The difficult economic situation of the island led many young men to offer their services as mercenaries in foreign armies especially after the Peloponnesian War.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline"

However, exceptions were permitted among powerful men for dynastic reasons, especially during the Hellenistic period (Alexander is a good example, and also the Ptolemies). And throughout Greek history, even ordinary men could have a concubine (pallakis), visit prostitutes, conduct affairs with boys, etc. There was no presumption of male sexual fidelity as a part of the marital state. That was strictly for wives. It was considered in bad taste to keep a concubine in the same house as one’s wife, but that was just about the only restriction. In general, the philosophers said that sexual desire was something men must suppress in order to achieve the good life; they thought that friendship was the most important value and it should always take precedence over sex. [...] The bottom line is that monogamy was the cultural expectation (supported by religion in the sense that even Zeus and Poseidon and Hades only had one wife each). The philosophers did not make much headway in changing this, and where they did, it was more in favor of abstinence (either with or without marriage) than of polygamy.” <sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> Classical period saw growth of polis-identity, strong association with poleis (e.g. during panhellenic festivals, though these existed in archaic period as well).

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14).

[...] We can also observe different grades of divine anger: libating with unwashed hands renders the ritual null and void, and the gods refuse to communicate with the worshipper. The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity. The intensity of the contact with the divinity corresponds directly to the intensity of the purity required for the worshipper and to the severity of the divine punishment if this requirement is violated."<sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ general supernatural enforcement of morality ♣ present ♥</b> "Although Homer's epic depicts a few exceptional figures like Tantalos and Sisyphos receiving punishment in the underworld (<i>Od.</i> 11 576-600), elaborate descriptions of underworld retributions come mostly from later sources, causing some scholars to suppose that a compensatory afterlife is a later invention.

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor—it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies.” <sup id="cite_ref-239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-239">[239]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ disputed_present_absent ♥</b> “It depends on what kind of authority. The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” <sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-240">[240]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “As I have suggested at the beginning of this paper, the idea that a ritually cleaned body cannot free a person from guilt and cannot be a sufficient requirement for a harmonious relationship between mortals and immortals can be understood as an implicit criticism of rituals. We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” <sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> “Piety required respect for one’s parents, especially in regard to making the annual offerings once they were dead. To mistreat a parent or neglect a parental tomb was a sign of moral depravity. Greek city-states legislated that children owed their parents food, lodging and burial (this goes back to Solon, the first lawgiver at Athens); those who failed in this duty could have their citizenship rights revoked. The worst crimes imaginable were incest with a parent and killing one’s own parent. Killing one’s own child did not carry the same weight of horror, although any kin-murder was considered more serious than murder of non-kin. The expectations for ritual purification after killing made these types of distinctions, and they could be regarded as a form of “regulation.” The Greeks recognized both written and unwritten laws. In general, the need to obey and respect parents was much, much stronger than any parental obligation to a child. Greek fathers throughout antiquity had the right to “expose” offspring they rejected at birth, which meant abandoning the infant either in the wild or in a place known to be used for that purpose, where it might or might not be picked up by slave traders. This did not count as murder, although once the infant was acknowledged by the father and accepted into the household, that would be a different matter. The Kyrene religious law code of the 4th century BCE says that “a man is bound as far as his brother’s children,” meaning that religious obligation (such as paying a fine levied for religious offense on a nephew) extended that far, and only on the paternal side.” <sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-242">[242]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> “Yes, this was definitely a “promoted value.” The Greeks called it either andreia (lit. “manliness”) or arete(“excellence”). A boy’s first school text was the Iliad, and he had to memorize long passages and write them out (or suffer beatings). As you know, this text is much concerned with the display of manly prowess in combat, which was the ultimate test of andreia. Evidence of cowardice (such as wounds taken in the back, or throwing away a shield in order to run) could ruin a man’s reputation in life or death. Plutarch wrote a book “On the Arete of Women,” in which he describes women who behaved in unexpectedly brave ways (usually by showing physical courage, fighting invaders, or counseling their men against cowardice). Some citations from the Hellenistic author Polybius: 5.111: King Attalus brought Gauls over from Europe as mercenaries because of their reputation for andreia. 6.46: [Citing unnamed sources] ‘For [they say that there are] two things on which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—andreia in the face of the enemy and concord at home.’ 27.8 [Deliberations by the Macedonian general Perseus after a victory]: ‘after this taste of Macedonian andreia, the Romans will be much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or harsh burden upon the Macedonians.’” <sup id="cite_ref-243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-243">[243]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> “I recommend the chapter “Greek law in the Hellenistic period” in M.

First cousin, half-sibling and uncle-niece marriages were permitted or even required for heiresses, in order to keep property within the paternal family. The Romans noticed this Greek habit of endogamy and disapproved of it. Daniel Ogden’s bookGreek Bastardy may also be of help here.
