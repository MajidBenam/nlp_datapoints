Changes in ceramics are so subtle as to be virtually indistinguishable from one phase to the next, or an early phase diagnostic style continues to appear in later phases. This poses some serious difficulties for breaking down larger periods into small phases based on the stylistic changes of diagnostic sherds and associating these to sociocultural changes." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Pollen studies by the Ecoandes Project show that the whole upper Buritaca area was covered by rainforest prior to the ninth century, but around the end of the tenth century human occupation and deforestation began. C14 dates obtained from an excavation I conducted in 1982 confirm that the early occupation of Ciudad Perdida began around 950 ± 60 BP." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"By the eighth or tenth century, transitional Nahuange-Tairona pottery had appeared at Buritaca 200, at 900 to 1,300 meters above sea level (Oyuela Cacedo 1986a), and the mature Tairona tradition was becoming established." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_6_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The ecological studies demonstrate how greatly and well the SNSM chiefdoms managed their landscapes, protecting and improving them. The center was occupied until the sixteenth century when the Spanish conquest began its processes of war and destruction.  The effects were catastrophic for the native population, reducing their numbers to less than 1% of pre-Hispanic highs following 100 years of continuous warfare. The region seems to have been completely abandoned around AD 1630 ± 55, based on C14 dates from collapsed structures and garbage (Oyuela-Caycedo 1986c, 1987a)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_CoTairo]"The term Tairona is a general, if not very accurate, label for the contact period Indian groups of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the adjacent areas of the Caribbean coast (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1953: 17-27; Bischof 1971; 1982-83). The word also applies to the archaeological culture created by their ancestors from around A.D. 800 to the Spanish Conquest. Spanish fleets first visited this coast in 1501-1502, and in 1524 Rodrigo de Bastidas founded the port of Santa Marta, from which military expeditions explored and eventually subjugated the hinterland. Tairona resistance was not finally broken until 1600." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_CoTairo]"Archaeological excavations at Ciudad Perdida indicate two major phases. Between AD 1000 and 1300, ceramic styles suggest a close connection with the coast, while after AD 1300 connections shifted to the highland regions to the west. Ciudad Perdida and surrounding communities were occupied until the late 1500s, when genocidal raids by Spaniards annihilated over 90 percent of the native population, driving the survivors into even more remote refuges." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_CoTairo]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥</b> "Between A.D. 1100-1200 and until their demise around A.D. 1600 after a century of disease, displacement, and war, these people continued to settle the narrow river valleys of the northern and western faces of the Sierra Nevada. It is these polities that are considered to be the “Tairona” proper and upon which the greater part of the research in the area has concentrated." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_CoTairo]"The socio-political organization of Tairona culture during the early part of the sixteenth century consisted of relatively independent chiefdoms, each including a priestly class and a hierarchy of chiefs as well as specialists in arts and crafts (e.g., gold workers, semiprecious stone engravers, merchants). This arts and crafts specialization, coupled with intensive exchange of agricultural products, was possible because of the regional ecological diversity found in the SNSM. The diversity encouraged the development of centers of specialization and regions of production for items such as ceramics, lithic artifacts, and agricultural products. At last archaeologists are beginning to understand the ancient system as they reconstruct the web of roads and pathways that connected all of the sites (Oyuela-Caycedo 1987a, 1990; Herrera de Turbay 1985; Kurela 1993; Herrera 2000)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CoTairo]"I believe that a religious movement that included peoples with different languages and from diverse political units (Reichel-Dolmattoff 1954a, b; Reichel-Dolmatoff and Dussan 1955; Mason 1931, 1936, 1939; Oyuela-Caycedo 1986a) produced the expansion of the “Tairona culture”. Tairona culture was a religious complex that promoted colonization of the SNSM." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CoTairo]"The Spanish encountered a truly complicated and fragmented political landscape with an assortment of ethnic and political groups of varying size, complexity, and regional power, amongst them those that may be thought of as the “Tairona”11 proper. Other groups residing in different parts of the Sierra Nevada at the end of the 15th century included the “Orejones” (Big Ears) and Chimilas to the Southwest and Southeast, the Tupe (Bari, Yuko-Yukpa) and Giriguano to the East, and the Guanebucan, Guajiro (Wayuu) and Cocina to the Northeast in the Guajira Peninsula. Spanish sources mention a number of “provinces” that they identify with these socio-political entities and called them accordingly; as in Provincia de los Orejones, Provincia de los Guanebucanes, and so on and so forth (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CoTairo]"It is nevertheless, quite clear that some of these polities were larger and more powerful than others and actually exerted some degree of control over subject populations and territories. For example, 16th century Spanish sources constantly mention two notoriously large and powerful Tairona polities that stood out from all others: Bonda and Pocigueica, with whom they warred on and off throughout the 16th century. It is also equally true that no single polity exerted its domain over all others." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the time of conquest, various polities (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951, 61):-Taironas along the rivers Don Diego, Buritaca and Guachaca (northern Sierra Nevada)-Bonda along the river Manzanares-the Santa Marta Coast populations also inhabited the Gaira and Durcino region to the South-another (possibly the same) group occupied the northern bays between Santa Marta and Dibulla-further away from Dibulla, the Guanebucán group-the populations of Betonia and Pocigueica</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥</b> "Major towns, such as Bonda and Pocigueica, were governed by chiefs (caciques) and seem to have formed the nuclei of incipient states. There is an unresolved debate about whether a higher level of organization ever existed. Reichel-Dolmatoff (1951: 88-90) argues that a number of confederations had emerged by the sixteenth century; Henning Bischof (1971; 1982-83) maintains that these were ephemeral alliances and that no permanent supralocal structure can be recognized." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CoTairo]"The 16th century accounts also suggest that constantly shifting alliances and trading partnerships, as well as occasional warfare leading to control over large areas and neighboring towns were quite common for this time." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CoTairo]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Neguanje ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥</b> "Ironically but unsurprisingly, while we were carrying out the architectural and topographic survey of Pueblito near the coast we were able to locate Neguanje period structures buried deep below Tairona terraces and structures on view to visitors and archaeologists alike. They had been, so to speak, underneath our noses all this time but had gone unnoticed by previous projects. Two overlapping Neguanje period dwellings, for example, were found almost 9 feet below the surface of a Tairona period terrace at Pueblito. In subsequent excavations at Teyuna-Ciudad Perdida we found the same pattern: earlier occupations and structures buried below structures that had been on view to everyone. When I discussed these findings in 2010 with Alicia Dussán, she indicated that it was quite clear that they had not been found because of the clean and very thick layers of fill separating the occupation levels. This had led them to assume only sterile layers of fill were to be found below Tairona household floors. This finding has allowed us to better understand the construction sequence of these places in a more nuanced and subtle fashion. Radiocarbon dates from buried occupations at both sites suggest that they were initially settled some time between A.D. 500 and A.D. 700, and grew relatively slowly up until A.D. 1100, reaching a size of about 30 acres. Core area plazas, terracing, and structures were then rapidly built some time between A.D. 1100 and A.D. 1200 and remained unchanged until A.D. 1600. That is, these areas were used and reused continuously but saw no major changes in their architectural layout. Yet both towns continued to expand after this time period, with growth concentrating mainly in residential areas. It is now clear that the Neguanje period peoples were directly related to the Tairona, and that there is a deeper time frame to the inhabitation and transformation of the northern and western side of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CoTairo] Perhaps not in the Macro Chibchan sphere: "By A. D. 600 the Initial Metal Group had evolved, in the same general area, into the International Group (see Fig. 2 for sorne of the characteristic forms and their distributions). This Group, in turn, disappeared from the archaeological record by about 900-1000. It must be emphasized that the Initial and International Groups constitute a single une of development. The division between them, typological and chronological, is an arbitrary one, and the two groups may eventually have to be combined."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Several urban clusters have been found in the upper Buritaca that consist of collections of terrace groups, making it difficult to determine where a site begins and ends. Deep valleys cut one part of a settlement from another. The largest of the sites is Ciudad Perdida, built between 1,100-1,200 masl." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CoTairo] Ciudad Perdida in the Upper Buritaca region.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"These figures fit well with the archaeological evidence from coastal and from highland regions for the existence of a three-level hierarchy of sites (Serje 1987; Oyuela Caycedo 1987b) in which the larger ones, such as Pueblito, have some 1,000 structures (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1954a: 161; 1954b; G. Reichel-Dolmatoff and A. Reichel-Dolmatoff 1955).Major towns, such as Bonda and Pocigueica, were governed by chiefs (caciques) and seem to have formed the nuclei of incipient states." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In a discussion about possible major settlements in earlier periods: "First, the conquerors never described the presence of large villages that had ample territorial control, as is the case for Bonda, Pocigueica, and Taironaca to provide a few of the best-known examples (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951). Fray Pedro de Aguado (/1581/ 1906, 5:69) describes the '...towns of Concha and Ancones, where Jagua and Jairada, and Guachaca, and Nando, and Naguanje are, towns of principal lords, river ports and Ocean ports'. This reference would support the idea of communities of similar prestige, 'towns of principal lords', none of which would have preeminence over the others."

Based on current evidence, these primary centers shared cultural styles but retained political independence; for example, there was no single “capital” of the Muisca, Tierradentro, San Agustin/Alto Magdalena, or Tairona chiefdoms. Further, these individual chiefdoms were relatively small, sometimes less than 100 km (60 miles) across, forming a complex political mosaic in Colombia."

In this time however, they built extensive networks of flagstone-paved roads and trails, irrigation and water channeling systems, terraced agricultural fields, and large stone masonry towns over a mountainous area comprising more than three thousand square kilometers, nine different biomes, and altitudes ranging from sea level to 3000 meters elevation."

If one takes into account the outlying residences, though it is still not clear if we can consider them to be part of the village or not, the area increases to about ten hectares. Despite these reservations, it seems likely that people living some distance from the main settlement cluster had some sort of relationship with the villagers, regardless of whether these residential units may or may not be considered a part of it. How fast or how slowly did the village expand at this point in time? This question cannot be answered by way of the data recovered through the shovel tests, but I will certainly address it in the next chapter, since excavations in the core area allowed us to gain a better sense of the speed and tempo of expansion during this early period. Population densities for the Neguanje village were very probably less than the 31.8 people per hectare estimated for the Tairona period, but the tight clustering and artifact densities suggest that at its peak the village population was between 100 and 160 inhabitants. If we add in the outlying residential clusters, the population might have feasibly reached 180 to 200 inhabitants. In comparison to the population figures estimated for Pueblito during the Tairona period, the demographic difference is profound and shows a dramatic increase in population."

Site 200 found in this survey, or Buritaca 200, as it was then called, is Ciudad Perdida, the “Lost City”, comprising more than 30 hectares of stone masonry terracing, circular and oblong buildings, stairways, and flag-stoned paths and sidewalks." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_57_CoTairo]Pueblito was probably bigger than Ciudad Perdida for the NGA area, even though Ciudad Perdida was the biggest settlement in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In a town such as Ciudad Perdida that by A.D. 1500 would have had 2500 to 3000 inhabitants, everyone would have been on view to everyone all the time as they moved about or worked in the open spaces and patios." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_58_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta: "The largest of the sites is Ciudad Perdida, built between 1,100-1,200 masl. The temperature is stable year-round with minor fluctuations between a maximum of 26 C during the day and a minimum of 16.5 C at night. The annual precipitation is approximately 4,000 mm. This carefully planned “city” is strategically located to dominate the Buritaca River Valley (for a discussion on Tairona urbanism see Aprile-Gniset 1991: 33-113). It has 120 residential terraces, each with one or more circular house platforms of fine stone masonry where a large circular building formerly stood. These terraces are interconnected by a complex web of flagstone stairs and pathways (Figure 22.14). Everything is linked by a simple systems of water drainage with channels designed to control water force as it ran down the steep slopes. Water runs slowly along the stone walls next to stairs and pathways to end in streams that dissect the site. In this way the Tairona controlled erosion, one of the major problems typically arising in steeply inclined environments (Serje de la Ossa 1984). If we suppose that a terrace (Figure 22.14b) represents one family unit, in contrast to the traditional western assumption that each circular house platform equals a family unit, then we can estimate that this site probably had a population of between 400-600 persons living in an area of 18 ha." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_59_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The lower portions of the Sierra Nevada, 360-500 m (1,181-1,650 ft) above sea level, were first occupied in the sixth and seventh centuries and the higher zones several centuries later. One of the largest of these late settlements is the site Ciudad Perdida (figure 10.18) Ciudad Perdida—also known as Teyuna and Buritaca 200—is a large set of terraces, circular dwellings, tombs, and plazas built on a web of ridges above the Rio Buritaca. The site covers about 30 ha (74 acres) and was discovered by looters in the mid-1970s. With more than 100 residential terraces, population may have been 2,000-8,000 people." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_60_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"By the 16th century, we estimate that Teyuna might have had a population between fifteen hundred and two thousand people.

The former attempts to differentiate among the types of Late Period settlements on the Buritaca Basin based on the number of dwelling platforms. Using such criteria, Serje (1987:90) identifies 'provincial capitals', like Buritaca 200 or Pueblito, with more than two hundred terraces; second order sites, with an average of eighty terraces; and peripheral sites, with fewer than fifty terraces. Based on that information a 'three-tiered settlement hierarchy' is proposed (Serje 1987:90). Oyuela (1995) also makes an attempt to evaluate the information about settlement patterns as they relate to models of social organization in Gaira and the Alto Buritaca Basin. Oyuela evaluated the presence of centralization in the settlements found in those two regions. Based on the rank-size method (Johnson 1981) he found a strongly convex distribution in both regions, thus proposing that the chiefdoms in the Sierra Nevada and the coastal plain did not constitute "centralized organizations" (Oyuela 1995:126)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_70_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Nevertheless, if the larger regional scale is considered, two or more clearly differentiated hierarchies may be identified. In fact, the studied area is very close to Pueblito (approximately 10km) where the Bonda settlement might belong, one of the places that the Spanish considered the seat of an important chiefdom (Figure1). Given that the most conservative estimate for Pueblito's area is 4km2, such a site would represent a higher level in the hierarchy."

Given their strategic location, it is possible that their function was to distribute and exchange products within the region, as in the well-studied cases of Formative Mesoamerica. "En el período clásico se distinguen por lo menos cuatro tipos de asentamientos como son: sitios de habitación temporal, sin ningún vestigio megalítico, tal vez campamentos ocasionales de pesca o de obtención de sal. Aldeas que en algunas ocasiones presentan infraestructura megalítica en el sector central. El tercer tipo son los centros secundarios de regular tamaño que presentan un sector central cívico ceremonial con estructuras megalíticas (no se observan sectorizaciones entre las terrazas de vivienda). El último tipo de asentamiento lo constituyen los centros primarios regionales, de los cuales se conocen dos, que son Pueblito y Ciudad Perdida. Estos se caracterizan por constar de una zona central de carácter cívico ceremonial y más de ciento cincuenta terrazas de vivienda agrupadas en sectores. Dada su situación estratégica, es probable que la función de esos asentamientos fuera la distribución y el intercambio de productos dentro de la región, de manera análoga a los bien estudiados casos de Mesoamérica durante el formativo."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_76_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Whatever the truth, Spanish sources suggest that the Tairona had a hierarchy of office- holders. Oviedo notes that the ruler of Bonda was “the Lord of all the caciques of that province” (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1953: 88), and for the Valle de la Caldera Father Pedro Simón wrote in 1628, “The towns [pueblos] would be about two hundred and fifty, and most of them obey a cacique called Guacanaoma, though there is not a single town that does not have its own Cacique or Mohan” (Simón 1882-92, 5: 192). Mohanes were native priests, and the significance of the naoma element in the cacique’s name is examined below. There is one possible mention of a female ruler, “a caciqua or principal woman among them” (Reichel- Dolmatoff 1951: 10), though the text is unclear about whether she was a ruler in her own right or simply a woman of high status, perhaps the wife of a chief. Some towns were divided into barrios, each of which had its subsidiary cacique (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951: 88). Besides caciques, Spanish sources mention capitanes, principales (nobles), mandadores (commanders), and capitanes de guerra. Fray Pedro Simón (1882-92, 5: 197) also lists a pregonero (speaker or crier) who was second only to the chief. Spanish accounts do not list the duties and powers of all these officials, but it seems clear that there was a hierarchy of civil and military office- holders." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_77_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The mohanes are undoubtedly priests (see Castellanos 1955, 2: 596), but the status of the naomas is less clear. Juan de Castellanos, writing in 1601, notes that naomas could hold political office and that they outranked ordinary caciques: “fifteen caciques, great señores, are subject to the command of the naoma called, it is said, Marocando” (Castellanos 1955, 2: 340). The same author also mentions a personage called Betoma, “whom they rec- ognized as a Naoma and who held command over all the caciques” (ibid.: 548). The political power of sixteenth-century naomas is not in doubt, but their priestly role remains ambiguous." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_78_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"We know that by the 16th century some leaders extended their political domain over other towns and lower ranking leaders, controlling great territories or “provinces”, as they were called by the Spanish. It is also true that no single leader exerted control over all the population and territory. This supposes a complicated sociopolitical arrangement, wherein different leaders probably competed with each other to extend their influence by way of alliances, trade partnerships and occasional skirmishes, so that their political power and authority increased or diminished accordingly."

Ciénaga was a meeting point for the Mompox indigenous populations and 'others which lived on the shores of the Magdalena', who met in order to obtain salt. Thanks to its strategic location close to the sea, the marshes and the mountains, and easy access to the interior plains, Ciénaga acted like an enclave of prehispanic trade between 'Tairona' societies and the populations of the Lower Magdalena and the plains of the River Cesar, enabling products from the Sierra to reach further territories via intermediaries.  "Sabemos, efectivamente, que a la llegada de los españoles Ciénaga era un mercado importante al cual acudían los indígenas de las montañas (en Friede, 1975. 1:212). Según algunas referencias del siglo XVI se trataba de "un gran pueblo, donde abajan los indios de la Sierra a rescatar pescado y sal, y traénles oro y mantas" (en Friede, 1960: 2141; de otro lado, aún en 1787. Ciénaga constituía un punto de encuentro para los indígenas de Mompox y de "otros que habitan en una y otra orilla del Magdalena" que se reunian con el fin de conseguir sal (Julíán, 1980: 110). Por su posición estratégica, cerca al mar, a las ciénagas, a la Sierra, y con fácil acceso a las llanuras del interior, Ciénaga actuaba como un enclave de comercio prebispánico entre las sociedades "tairona" y los pobladores del bajo Magdalena y Uanuras del Cesar, brindando la posibilidad de que, a través de intermediarios, los productos producidos en la Sierra Uegaran a territorios bien alejados."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_115_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"For Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff (1958, 1965 Ch. 8) as well as for Paul Wheatley (1971: 322, 327, 397) this configuration was clearly related to the emergence of ceremonial complexes among the Tairona pointing in the direction of urbanization and increasing sociopolitical differentiation. For Wheatley (Ibid: 397) however, the evidence available at that time suggested that this development had been truncated at some stage. More recently, Augusto Oyuela (1998, 2005) has argued in favor of thinking about the early emergence during the Neguanje period of this temple-ceremonial complex, which resulted in the progressive routinization of religious ritualization of Tairona and eventually contemporary Kogi life. The new data collected for Pueblito by this project suggests somewhat different alternatives than those argued by these authors. For one, the archaeological evidence clearly indicates that the Eastern Plaza and its feasting/ceremonial structure did not exist prior to about A.D. 1250. Given the data collected through shovel tests for the Western Plaza that point to buried Neguanje period occupations in this area as well, it is also highly probable that this structure was also built around A.D. 1100 to 1250. In this sense at least, the plaza and large circular rings at Pueblito were not built early enough to support Oyuela-Caycedo's hypotheses of a continuous “ritual tradition” beginning some time during the Neguanje period and continuing up to the 21st century. On the other hand, a close examination of Alden Mason's (1931,1936, 1939) and Reichel-Dolmatoff and Dussán's (1955) excavation data for both these structures definitely reveals their use in ceremonies, but also as I have argued here and elsewhere (Giraldo 2000), for elaborate feasting and conducting of a “politics of commensality” by indigenous elites and leaders. As such these do not seem to be structures exclusively or explicitly dedicated to religious activities in charge of religious specialists. In other words, these are not temples, nor do they bear anything but a superficial structural resemblance to a Kogi nuhue or cansamaría such as those described by Reichel-Dolmatoff (1990: 10) or Uribe (1990). By this I do not mean to imply that there were no temples or structures within or even outside Tairona towns,25 only that the large circular structures associated to plazas in Pueblito were used for communal gatherings, ceremonies, and feasting at which there must have been a confluence of authorities.

This arts and crafts specialization, coupled with intensive exchange of agricultural products, was possible because of the regional ecological diversity found in the SNSM. The diversity encouraged the development of centers of specialization and regions of production for items such as ceramics, lithic artifacts, and agricultural products. At last archaeologists are beginning to understand the ancient system as they reconstruct the web of roads and pathways that connected all of the sites (Oyuela-Caycedo 1987a, 1990; Herrera de Turbay 1985; Kurela 1993; Herrera 2000)."

The main building (La Capilla, No. 44), which is of oblong shape, is approximately 28 meters long and 12 meters wide at its widest and longest points. The dimensions vary somewhat given its shape, but the roofed area, including eaves, would have covered approximately 380-400 square meters. The building had at least two entrances, one on the northern side and another close to the southwest “corner”. It is probable that it had more entrances, but these are the only two that were preserved. An additional structure can be found at the terrace's northernmost end, an 8 meter in diameter foundation ring with a roofed area of 50 square meters."

A midden located on its western side shows that it was probably in use during the 15th and 16th centuries, which places its construction around the early part of the 16th century. If the size of this platform, which is approximately 82 meters in length by 13 meters wide is any measure of the effectiveness of Tairona elites living at Ciudad Perdida to mobilize labor and resources, then it certainly points to the existence of very powerful leaders during this time period. The data thus point to a long consolidated form of authority, even though its full extent, nature, and power is still an enigma."

That these places were part of a sacred landscape, akin to Inka wakas for example (see D'Altroy 2002), the “natural” places used throughout Europe as settings for rituals (Bradley 2000), or the sanctuaries of the Classical world (Alcock and Osborne 1994) is a distinct possibility.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_198_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]At the beginning of the century, a few villages and cities allied under the command of local caciques. It seems that there were internal power struggles between the Taironas and their immediate neighbours, partly between cities, partly between the authority of the caciques and that of an influential group of priests, circumstance which would then be used by the Spaniards to their advantage."Al comienzo del siglo algunas aldeas y ciudades se aliaron bajo el mando de caciques locales. Parece que en aquel entonces entre los Taironas y sus vecinos inmediatos habían surgido luchas internas por el poder, en parte entre ciudades, en parte entre la autoridad de los caciques y la de un grupo influyente de sacerdotes, circunstancia que, desde luego, fue-aprovechada por los españoles." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_199_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The level of warfare by 1530 CE indicates that the Taironas had some experience in warfare, possibly ritual warfare as well:"There is also ample ethnohistoric evidence, well documented and too detailed to review in this chapter that the Tairona were relatively effective in resisting Spanish military intervention since the very first contacts; this appears to show fairly belligerent relation between chiefdoms (Redmond 1994:32-34, Tovar 1988, 1993, 1997, Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951, Castellanos 1944 to name a few). Although this belligerence seems to have been the result of complex chiefdoms allying with the Spanish from time to time and somewhat ritualized confrontations that did not necessarily lead to extensive destruction there seems to be a clear leadership in these events and a centralized form of control over war preparations. In the most notorious case, the Chief of Bonda ordered fields to be planted to produce resources for a campaign against the town of Posigüieca in 1530 (see Figure 4.1). The Chief rallied 600 warrior and led the attack accompanied by 300 Spanish soldiers, only to reach a standoff near the town and return to Bonda without really attacking, just burning and cutting down some corn fields on the periphery of the town. A day later the Spanish attacked Posigüieca without defeating it and taking so many losses that they had to retreat defeated to Santa Marta. It should be noted that this was the third unsuccessful attempt to destroy Posigüieca with Spanish forces far exceeding those used in the conquest of the Muisca and Inca. Those who survived were the few who were on horseback and then again it is inferred that about a third of them died of their wounds. The behavior of the Chief of Bonda appears to be consistent with a ritualized practice of “showing-off” his ability to amass a crowd. Adorned in feathers and fully armed, a typical behavior for a Chief more interested in acquiring prestige than conquest (Redmond 1994, Drennan 1995:305). It is likely that he did in fact score points in his favor within his chiefdom and with Posigüieca. He evidently obtained prestige without having to obliterate his “enemy” and in the process demonstrated his ability to organize labor and extract surplus from his followers under the pretext of war. His attitude results in a win-win situation where the only ones experiencing great losses are the Spanish. After all, the new fields were planted, the bows, arrows and maces furnished, the poisoned darts produced and the warriors concentrated under a single head. The objectives of the Chief of Bonda were met, and he gained prestige within his ranks and the Spanish, accumulated corn and for the time being gained political dominance (Tovar 1993). The size and resilience of the Chiefdoms of Bonda and Posigüieca suggest that the Tairona society did have a considerable capacity to articulate and manage its resources, material and human, into politically effective strategies but that war did not have the same objectives as in the European paradigms (Ferguson and Whitehead 2000)."

La iconografía representada en cerámica, piedra y objetos metálicos, deja reconocer algunas figuras individualizadas que podrían identificarse con una divinidad solar o con chamanes ataviados. También hay series de figuras que parecen ser animales totémicos o espíritus protectores, como los que enumeré al hablar de la cerámica zoomorfa. Algunos datos históricos y arqueológicos parecen indicar la observación astronómica desde templos u otros puntos fijos. El complejo ritual de las hachas monolíticas, insignias en forma de espátula o tenedor, placas sonajeras y, no por último, la gran importancia ritual de las cuentas de collar, pueden explicarse en parte con la ayuda de los datos etnográficos sobre las tribus sobrevivientes de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_203_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The zoomorphic ceramics that Reichel-Dolmatoff refers to are: "felinos, marsupiales, murciélagos, culebras, tortugas, ranas y aves tales como paujiles y rapaces" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_204_CoTairo]&nbsp;: felines, marsupials, bats, snakes, turtles, frogs and birds such as curassows and birds of prey.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Most dysphoric ritual: priestly accession?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"In 1561, an account tells of an incursion to the Nueva Salamanca de la Ramada, an area where the town of Dibulla is located today (Restrepo Tirado 1943: 860). During this trip, the process of the accession of a priest was described: "They obeyed an Indian called mohán who cured them of sickness. At his death he would be succeeded by his son who had been kept enclosed without seeing the sun for ten years." This description greatly resembles the process of training for priesthood noted by Reichel-Dolmatoff (1976b) for the Kaggaba." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_205_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Shamanism[MAJIDBENAM_BR] "The Bird-man motif is present in almost all of the country’s precious metal societies with the exception of the Quimbaya. It symbolises the flight of the shaman to other worlds or other levels of the cosmos, and can be seen, in particular, in the representations of Bird-men from Cauca, showing a plethora of birds and other auxiliary characters, and the eagles of the Taironas." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_206_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Possible fertility ceremony[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"One unusual vessel is a double-handled bowl depicting a ritual enactment scene, at the centre of which is a circular pit with two figures standing opposite one another, apparently holding rattles and officiating (Plate LIV). A large appendage extending from between their legs appears to be a bifurcated phallus resting on the edge of the ring. At opposite sides of the ring are two serpentiform, phallic elements (unbifurcated and unattached to any figure) flanked by two standing figures with rattles. On either side of the main officiate is a seated figure holding a child. Opposite, a guardian figure stands on each side of a second officiate.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kogi ethnography gives us insight into the possible meaning of this scene.[...] Are the two seated figures holding twins? Is this the significance of the bifurcate phalli of the officiates? Is this ritual scene depicting a fertility ceremony involving the birth of twins, officiated by priests of a lineage similar to the kurcha of the Kogi? All of these iconographic elements tend to support such an interpretation, although we must allow for other meanings." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_207_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Harvest ritual?[MAJIDBENAM_BR]They had dedicated feasts, celebrated with dances, clothes adorned with plumage, and this happened particularly around the maize harvests, when women also had their feasts, dressed in White and with many collars and beads around their necks, arms and legs, and gold jewels on their necks and ears, and with them the most lively young people danced, and everything ended in drunkenness.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Simón says about the Caldera Valley: “they had incredibly grand, strange and clean feasting and dancing, which took place on big flagstone patio.  “Tenían sus fiestas señaladas, que se celebraban con danzas, vestidos de rica plumeria, y en especial se hacía esto en las cosechas de maiz, cuando también las mujeres hacian las suyas vestidas de blanco, con muchos collares y cuentan en el cuello, piernas y brazos, y joyas de oro, segun las tenían, al cuello y orejas, con que hacian sus bailes festejandolas los mozos mas briosos del pueblo, que todo venia a para en embriagueces” (32, V, 218). Sobre el valle de la Caldera dice Simón: “hacían sus fiestas y bailes de extraña grandeza, limpieza y curiosidad, como la tenían en los patios enlosados de grandísimas y pulidas piedras” (32, V, 191)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_208_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Sexual behaviour during rituals[MAJIDBENAM_BR] Simón explains that temples had depictions of ‘abominations’ and ‘horrible figures’ to entice them to have sex, and that they did it publicly with each other in temples. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_209_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Tairona presented cases of homosexuality for rituals and in preparation for warfare, selective and circumstancial. &nbsp;:"Tales concepciones, por extensión, se ampliaron a los taironas, pues aunque no eran antropófagos (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1951) sí presentaban aparentemente casos de homosexualismo ritual y preparatorio para la guerra, selectivo y circunstancial." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_210_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Importance of alcohol[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Documents indicate that alcohol consumption did not seem to be individual. Brother Pedro Simón indicates that maize harvest festivals, in which indigenous people participated with their best clothes, were characterized by the continual ingestion of alcohol until general intoxication ensued.  "Más aún, las fuentes documentales indican que el consumo de alcohol no parece ser individual. Fray Pedro Simón menciona que las fiestas de cosecha del maíz, en las que los indígenas aparecían con sus mejores vestiduras, se caracterizaban por la ingestión continua de alcohol hasta llegar a una intoxicación generalizada (Simón en Reichel-DolmatoH 1951:94)." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_211_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Fasting[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In religious and magical ceremonies, fasting played an important role. […] Simón explains the fasts thus: “while fasting, the Demon told them a thousand lies. When the Devil talked to them in his hut, the lights were turned off. For these fires, they had stacks of firewood from odoriferous and exotic tres, that could only be lumbered for these purposes. […][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Fasting was an important part of  priestly training,  and Simón says that the first thing they did was fasting between 16 and 20 years by eating only one bread roll per day, and living in retirement in caves or altitude, during which time they only saw the man bringing their food.  If they saw a woman, the fasting they had done until then was null and they had to start again, being the sensual people we have discussed. Fasting implied not eating all day until the sunset, but then they made up for it with chicha, with which they were as excessive as the others.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]“En las ceremonias religiosas y mágicas desempeñaban un papel importante el ayuno ritual […] Simón explica estos ayunos así: “Estando en estos ayunos, les hablaba el Demonio ensartándoles mil mentiras… Cuando les hablaba el Diablo en su buhío, se había de apagar la lumbre que había en el toda la noche, por mandado suyo, para lo cual tenía en la puerta del temple crecidos rimeros y haces de leña de arboles odoriferos y peregrinos, que nadie podia cortar sino para aquello” (32, V, 217, 191). “Al entrarles a hablar a los Mohanes el Demonio, era con tan gran ventisquero y hurracán que parece quería arrancar el buhío…” (32, V, 217). Los ayunos que como vimos antes también eran observados durante la primera menstruacion, formaban parte importante del aprentizaje de los futuros sacerdotes y Simón dice: “Mohanes… los cuales primero que tomasen la posesión del oficio, habían de estar en coime, que es en ayunos, diez y seis o veinte años, sin comer en ellos mas que un bollo cada dia, y tan retirados a las espesuras de los montes y en cuevas, que no había de ver en todos ellos hombres, mas que el que les llevaba la comida, y si acaso veian alguna mujer, daban por ninguno el ayuno hecho hasta allí y lo comenzaban de nuevo, como ser tan sensuales como hemos dicho…” (32, V, 217). “El ayuno ordinario era no comer en todo el dia hasta puesto el sol, pero entonces se desquitaban en beber de su chicha, en que corrian igual fortuna de exceso con las demás naciones” (32, V, 218). “ [MAJIDBENAM_REF_212_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<br>Funerary rites [MAJIDBENAM_REF_213_CoTairo]:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]-In Santa Marta in 1514 (description by Oviedo): the bones and ashes were kept within the house, in urns or big painted vases made of earthenware. Others didn't dare burning the remains, but dried them and covered them with cotton cloths, on which they put gold chains and gold plates.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]-in Bonda in 1575 (description by Simón): the burial rites were accompanied by much weeping. The bodies  of people killed by Spaniards were put on the coals, taking the grease from the beverage given to those lucky in war that designated people poured on them, and converted to ashes.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]-Another person in the region more generally had their body folded over, put into a vault with its jewels, women and slaves (but the practice of being buried with retainers is not documented anywhere else).[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Use of drugs/alcohol:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Herrera says that the coastal Indians masticate a grass called hayo, but without referring directly to the Santa Marta region. The consumption of chicha (maize beer) in substantial quantities is mentioned a few times. "Sobre el uso de la coca hay un dato en Herrera donde dice que los indios de la costa del mar mastican una hierba llamada hayo, pero sin referirse directamente a los indigenas de la region de Santa Marta (18, VIII, 24). El consumo de chicha en cantidades embriagantes se menciona en algunas ocasiones (32, V, 181, 218). [MAJIDBENAM_REF_214_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Simón describes Tairona fiesta costumes:They had their appointed fiestas which they celebrated with dances,dressed in rich featherwork, and they did this especially at the times of the maize harvests, when the women also had theirs, dressed in white, with many necklaces and beads on their necks, legs and arms, and with golden jewels, according to what they had, at their necks and ears. (1882-92, 5: 218)" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_215_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Ethnographic analogies are often drawn with the Kogi (perhaps not a reliable way of sourcing data):[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Religion may have been another basis for integrating communities. Based on ethnohistoric and ethnographic sources, the Kágaba have a priestly class known as the mámas. Although it is not certain that similar religious authorities existed in pre-contact societies, modern Kágaba settlements broadly correspond to the earlier archaeological pattern. Oyuela-Caycedo writes, “The Kágaba are a society of temples, priests, sacred hamlets, sacred spaces, complex cosmology, and sea- sonal festivities of rituals, where religious recitation and esoteric knowledge are the bases of power. Such knowledge is the immaterial property of the houses.” By “houses,” Oyuela-Caycedo means not just a dwelling but a social entity composed of people, buildings, property, and rights. In the Kágaba case, this social entity may have had an explicitly “theocratic” emphasis, as the priestly class, the mámas, had particular authority. According to Oyuela-Caycedo:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Kágaba priest (Máma) is the transmitter of the knowledge of the house; he is the living figure in charge of a temple that belongs to a house. At the same time, the temple building is the landmark of the house. The Máma is the only one who can learn the “Mother Laws” (the ultimate sacred propositions) . . . Knowledge is the main factor in the prestige and rank given to an individual in relation to his position in a house and between houses. Sacred knowledge is acquired mainly by avuncular descent, but common individuals can achieve status through the payment of goods, work or cash to the Máma in exchange for knowledge. If an individual wishes to be competent in knowledge, he must study throughout his life with different priests of houses that have alliances with his own. Each main house temple, with the figure of the Máma at the head, specialize [sic] in some aspect of knowledge . . . but no one master or temple controls the total domain of knowledge. This differential access and domain of knowledge account for the competitions and rankings between the priests and temples, as well as between the houses to which they belong. To repeat, it is not known whether late prehistoric societies in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta were organized along the same principles of houses, temples, and priestly savants. However, the Kágaba model would account for the archaeological patterns as currently understood. Further, these ethnographic data present an intriguing perspective on the subtle organization of chiefly societies in prehispanic Colombia." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_216_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"From the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, possibly of Tairona origin, come various ceramic vessels featuring different ritual scenes on their interiors, as if they also represented a temple. In one of them, the characters are arranged in a circle and wear massive masks similar to those found by Father Julián in 1778 in the Sierra, but different from those found by the German ethnologist, Theodore Konrad Preuss, in 1914 among the Koguis from the same area. The figures also wear great crowns, presumably of feathers. One of the figures clearly represents an eagle, identifiable by its hooked beak and menacing appearance. Inside, in its central part, the vessel has an incised circular figure, away from the rest, that could represent a curled up snake whose centre forms its head. Between this snake and the mysterious masked figures there are a series of small concentric circles, penetrating the ground as if they were the bases of the posts supporting the supposed temple. However, another possible interpretation is that they represent the snake’s tail ribs. It is also possible they represent both things. The vessel’s exterior is covered in rhomboids, circles, dots, etc., evoking the phosphenic figures. The same vessel is a metaphor for the uterus - the container - which cooks up its own transformation.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]This temple-vessel synthesises some of the elements of religious experience. " [MAJIDBENAM_REF_217_CoTairo][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Material evidence for feasting and/or ritual activity on the Eastern Plaza at Pueblito:[MAJIDBENAM_BR]"When Alden Mason excavated the structure in 1922 a great number of objects were found, including many fragments of large double spouted pots used for brewing chicha, (see fig. 4.21), axe-heads, and nine caches of polished stone objects with monolithic axes, stone batons, two-legged seats, winged stone ornaments, beads, uncut quartz crystals and polished stone pebbles located towards both entrances and underneath stone markers. In the center of the site, a low four-legged stone seat or banquito,was found. Roughly towards the north and south of the structure he found 22 ceramic vessels placed under stone markers at varying depths containing beads, ornaments, and unworked carnelian chips. For a complete description see Mason 1931: 93-102. Partial re-excavation of the area around the Eastern entrance (left in photograph) by Reichel-Dolmatoff and Dussán (1955: 238-239) revealed dedication offerings placed below the ring slabs and main threshold stone. The offerings had been placed in a cylindrical treasure jar and consisted of 3 polished green stone forked objects, 4 green stone winged ornaments, 23 red quartz beads, and 18 red unshaped quartz crystals. Underneath the main threshold stone they found a bat-shaped winged ornament, the tips carved to look like jaguars. By the main (1st) threshold stone and 80 centimeters below the surface, they found 3 tubular pink quartz beads lying beside a very deteriorated jaguar skull. 1 meter below the surface they also found 3 vessels with 200 quartz beads."

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_221_CoTairo] "Yet apart from these subtle markers, no other architectural feature makes it obvious that one is 'entering' or 'leaving' this particular space or that of the Western Plaza, especially because both have more than 15 direct access points giving unrestricted access to the double plaza configuration. Hence, the two subspherical stones and the stelae may very well be meant to act as portals only on certain occasions. It is also clear that the builders possessed enough knowledge about engineering and stonework to have built more substantial entryways, thresholds or walls if they had wanted to restrict access to any or both of the plazas. Instead, and to the contrary of what one would expect of an 'elite' area within a pre-Hispanic town or city in the Central Andes for example, the plazas may be reached from many different directions through multiple pathways. This suggests that the whole point of the double plaza configuration and placement was to draw in people from all over the town, and possibly even from the surrounding villages, to participate in public events. In this sense, not only is the area politically and socially important by virtue of its placement at the spatial center of the town, but also because its very design connects and convokes. Here then, power lies not in exclusion but in connection through manifest physical and social links." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_222_CoTairo]"For one, the archaeological evidence clearly indicates that the Eastern Plaza and its feasting/ceremonial structure did not exist prior to about A.D. 1250. Given the data collected through shovel tests for the Western Plaza that point to buried Neguanje period occupations in this area as well, it is also highly probable that this structure was also built around A.D. 1100 to 1250. In this sense at least, the plaza and large circular rings at Pueblito were not built early enough to support Oyuela-Caycedo's hypotheses of a continuous 'ritual tradition' beginning some time during the Neguanje period and continuing up to the 21st century. On the other hand, a close examination of Alden Mason's (1931,1936, 1939) and Reichel-Dolmatoff and Dussán's (1955) excavation data for both these structures definitely reveals their use in ceremonies, but also as I have argued here and elsewhere (Giraldo 2000), for elaborate feasting and conducting of a 'politics of commensality' by indigenous elites and leaders. As such these do not seem to be structures exclusively or explicitly dedicated to religious activities in charge of religious specialists. In other words, these are not temples, nor do they bear anything but a superficial structural resemblance to a Kogi nuhue or cansamaría such as those described by Reichel-Dolmatoff (1990: 10) or Uribe (1990). By this I do not mean to imply that there were no temples or structures within or even outside Tairona towns,25 only that the large circular structures associated to plazas in Pueblito were used for communal gatherings, ceremonies, and feasting at which there must have been a confluence of authorities. To date, no structure explicitly and unequivocally dedicated to religious activity that may be taken to be a 'temple' has yet been found or excavated in Pueblito or anywhere else for that matter." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_223_CoTairo] "I have also argued here that the creation and ongoing maintenance of these social and spatial links was probably accomplished by way of elite sponsored feasting and ceremonies taking place in Pueblito and Ciudad Perdida's central plazas and buildings involving copious amounts of food and drink. The importance of these buildings as part of a 'politics of commensality' (Dietler 2001) through which alliances, trading partnerships, and social bonds are created and recreated was highlighted by the partial excavation of storeroom at Pueblito in which the majority of artifacts were serving and drinking vessels. Inside the feasting/ceremonial structure, excavations by John Alden Mason in 1921/1922 found numerous fragments of double spouted ceramic urns used for brewing chicha, providing good evidence of the use of these buildings as venues for feasts. The artifact assemblages found inside these feasting/ceremonial buildings and nearby residences also suggests that these served as repositories of valuable goods such as stone batons, winged pendants and monolithic axes probably used in ceremonies and rituals, as well as axe-heads, carnelian, quartz, and jadeite beads. These indicate that at a certain level, social and spatial hierachies involved the construction of power and authority as capacities embedded in place. Taking a cue from Weiner (in Myers 2001: 9), it may be that these places become culturally 'dense', and politically and socially powerful by virtue of the amounts of ancestral relics, valuable objects, heirlooms, and regalia that were accumulated in them. "It is highly probable then that authority and political power at Pueblito and Ciudad Perdida revolved around hosting elaborate feasts and ceremonies involving a good portion of the population. The plaza spaces in Pueblito also suggest open air performances, meetings, or activities in front of audiences, with at least one of them having what appear to be stone benches arranged along its perimeter.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_246_CoTairo]"For one, the archaeological evidence clearly indicates that the Eastern Plaza and its feasting/ceremonial structure did not exist prior to about A.D. 1250. Given the data collected through shovel tests for the Western Plaza that point to buried Neguanje period occupations in this area as well, it is also highly probable that this structure was also built around A.D. 1100 to 1250. In this sense at least, the plaza and large circular rings at Pueblito were not built early enough to support Oyuela-Caycedo's hypotheses of a continuous 'ritual tradition' beginning some time during the Neguanje period and continuing up to the 21st century. On the other hand, a close examination of Alden Mason's (1931,1936, 1939) and Reichel-Dolmatoff and Dussán's (1955) excavation data for both these structures definitely reveals their use in ceremonies, but also as I have argued here and elsewhere (Giraldo 2000), for elaborate feasting and conducting of a 'politics of commensality' by indigenous elites and leaders. As such these do not seem to be structures exclusively or explicitly dedicated to religious activities in charge of religious specialists. In other words, these are not temples, nor do they bear anything but a superficial structural resemblance to a Kogi nuhue or cansamaría such as those described by Reichel-Dolmatoff (1990: 10) or Uribe (1990). By this I do not mean to imply that there were no temples or structures within or even outside Tairona towns,25 only that the large circular structures associated to plazas in Pueblito were used for communal gatherings, ceremonies, and feasting at which there must have been a confluence of authorities. To date, no structure explicitly and unequivocally dedicated to religious activity that may be taken to be a 'temple' has yet been found or excavated in Pueblito or anywhere else for that matter." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_247_CoTairo] "I have also argued here that the creation and ongoing maintenance of these social and spatial links was probably accomplished by way of elite sponsored feasting and ceremonies taking place in Pueblito and Ciudad Perdida's central plazas and buildings involving copious amounts of food and drink. The importance of these buildings as part of a 'politics of commensality' (Dietler 2001) through which alliances, trading partnerships, and social bonds are created and recreated was highlighted by the partial excavation of storeroom at Pueblito in which the majority of artifacts were serving and drinking vessels. Inside the feasting/ceremonial structure, excavations by John Alden Mason in 1921/1922 found numerous fragments of double spouted ceramic urns used for brewing chicha, providing good evidence of the use of these buildings as venues for feasts. The artifact assemblages found inside these feasting/ceremonial buildings and nearby residences also suggests that these served as repositories of valuable goods such as stone batons, winged pendants and monolithic axes probably used in ceremonies and rituals, as well as axe-heads, carnelian, quartz, and jadeite beads. These indicate that at a certain level, social and spatial hierachies involved the construction of power and authority as capacities embedded in place. Taking a cue from Weiner (in Myers 2001: 9), it may be that these places become culturally 'dense', and politically and socially powerful by virtue of the amounts of ancestral relics, valuable objects, heirlooms, and regalia that were accumulated in them. "It is highly probable then that authority and political power at Pueblito and Ciudad Perdida revolved around hosting elaborate feasts and ceremonies involving a good portion of the population.

Inside the feasting/ceremonial structure, excavations by John Alden Mason in 1921/1922 found numerous fragments of double spouted ceramic urns used for brewing chicha, providing good evidence of the use of these buildings as venues for feasts. The artifact assemblages found inside these feasting/ceremonial buildings and nearby residences also suggests that these served as repositories of valuable goods such as stone batons, winged pendants and monolithic axes probably used in ceremonies and rituals, as well as axe-heads, carnelian, quartz, and jadeite beads. These indicate that at a certain level, social and spatial hierachies involved the construction of power and authority as capacities embedded in place. Taking a cue from Weiner (in Myers 2001: 9), it may be that these places become culturally 'dense', and politically and socially powerful by virtue of the amounts of ancestral relics, valuable objects, heirlooms, and regalia that were accumulated in them. "It is highly probable then that authority and political power at Pueblito and Ciudad Perdida revolved around hosting elaborate feasts and ceremonies involving a good portion of the population. The plaza spaces in Pueblito also suggest open air performances, meetings, or activities in front of audiences, with at least one of them having what appear to be stone benches arranged along its perimeter.

Hence, the two subspherical stones and the stelae may very well be meant to act as portals only on certain occasions. It is also clear that the builders possessed enough knowledge about engineering and stonework to have built more substantial entryways, thresholds or walls if they had wanted to restrict access to any or both of the plazas. Instead, and to the contrary of what one would expect of an 'elite' area within a pre-Hispanic town or city in the Central Andes for example, the plazas may be reached from many different directions through multiple pathways. This suggests that the whole point of the double plaza configuration and placement was to draw in people from all over the town, and possibly even from the surrounding villages, to participate in public events. In this sense, not only is the area politically and socially important by virtue of its placement at the spatial center of the town, but also because its very design connects and convokes. Here then, power lies not in exclusion but in connection through manifest physical and social links."

The importance of these buildings as part of a 'politics of commensality' (Dietler 2001) through which alliances, trading partnerships, and social bonds are created and recreated was highlighted by the partial excavation of storeroom at Pueblito in which the majority of artifacts were serving and drinking vessels. Inside the feasting/ceremonial structure, excavations by John Alden Mason in 1921/1922 found numerous fragments of double spouted ceramic urns used for brewing chicha, providing good evidence of the use of these buildings as venues for feasts. The artifact assemblages found inside these feasting/ceremonial buildings and nearby residences also suggests that these served as repositories of valuable goods such as stone batons, winged pendants and monolithic axes probably used in ceremonies and rituals, as well as axe-heads, carnelian, quartz, and jadeite beads. These indicate that at a certain level, social and spatial hierachies involved the construction of power and authority as capacities embedded in place. Taking a cue from Weiner (in Myers 2001: 9), it may be that these places become culturally 'dense', and politically and socially powerful by virtue of the amounts of ancestral relics, valuable objects, heirlooms, and regalia that were accumulated in them. "It is highly probable then that authority and political power at Pueblito and Ciudad Perdida revolved around hosting elaborate feasts and ceremonies involving a good portion of the population. The plaza spaces in Pueblito also suggest open air performances, meetings, or activities in front of audiences, with at least one of them having what appear to be stone benches arranged along its perimeter.

Both cultures are marked by the prominence of urn burial. Among the Kagabas this is original, or primary burial. Among the Taironas it usually was secondary burial, but several cases of primary urn burial were noted. So was the use of broken pots to wedge mamas’ bodies into burial urns-as is done by the Kagabas today."

AD</span> The Taironas had ceremonial houses that the Spaniards named ‘Devil’s hut’ and the Indians ‘Santa Maria’ to imitate catholic temples dedicated to the Virgin Mary. A real ceremonial centre is also mentioned in the Tairona Valley, and the Spaniards named it Pueblo de Mohan or New Rome, ‘mostly constituted of Devil’s huts, that each village in the province had made and to which they went on pilgrimage, each going to their hut to ask for a remedy to their needs.  “Los Taironas y sus vecinos tenían sacerdotes llamados naomas y en las poblaciones había casas ceremoniales que los españoles denominaban ‘Buhío del Diablo” y los indios “Santa Maria” a imitación de los templos católicos dedicados a la Virgen. En una ocasíon se habla de un verdadero centro ceremonial en el Valle de Tairona y los españoles lo llamaron Pueblo de Mohan o la Nueva Roma: “…era su mayor parte de buhíos o caneyes del Diablo, que tenían hechos cada pueblo de los de la Provincia, donde iban en romeria, a pedir cada cual en su buhío remedio de sus necesidades…” (32, V, 201)” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_354_CoTairo] <i>"For Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff (1958, 1965 Ch. 8) as well as for Paul Wheatley (1971: 322, 327, 397) this configuration was clearly related to the emergence of ceremonial complexes among the Tairona pointing in the direction of urbanization and increasing sociopolitical differentiation. For Wheatley (Ibid: 397) however, the evidence available at that time suggested that this development had been truncated at some stage. More recently, Augusto Oyuela (1998, 2005) has argued in favor of thinking about the early emergence during the Neguanje period of this temple-ceremonial complex, which resulted in the progressive routinization of religious ritualization of Tairona and eventually contemporary Kogi life. The new data collected for Pueblito by this project suggests somewhat different alternatives than those argued by these authors. For one, the archaeological evidence clearly indicates that the Eastern Plaza and its feasting/ceremonial structure did not exist prior to about A.D. 1250. Given the data collected through shovel tests for the Western Plaza that point to buried Neguanje period occupations in this area as well, it is also highly probable that this structure was also built around A.D. 1100 to 1250. In this sense at least, the plaza and large circular rings at Pueblito were not built early enough to support Oyuela-Caycedo's hypotheses of a continuous “ritual tradition” beginning some time during the Neguanje period and continuing up to the 21st century. On the other hand, a close examination of Alden Mason's (1931,1936, 1939) and Reichel-Dolmatoff and Dussán's (1955) excavation data for both these structures definitely reveals their use in ceremonies, but also as I have argued here and elsewhere (Giraldo 2000), for elaborate feasting and conducting of a “politics of commensality” by indigenous elites and leaders. As such these do not seem to be structures exclusively or explicitly dedicated to religious activities in charge of religious specialists. In other words, these are not temples, nor do they bear anything but a superficial structural resemblance to a Kogi nuhue or cansamaría such as those described by Reichel-Dolmatoff (1990: 10) or Uribe (1990. By this I do not mean to imply that there were no temples or structures within or even outside Tairona towns,25 only that the large circular structures associated to plazas in Pueblito were used for communal gatherings, ceremonies, and feasting at which there must have been a confluence of authorities. To date, no structure explicitly and unequivocally dedicated to religious activity that may be taken to be a “temple” has yet been found or excavated in Pueblito or anywhere else for that matter."

In chapter 5 the data from the distribution of ceramics by residential areas was interpreted into a model of the social hierarchy of the last phases of Chengue. The 20% of the population that is classified as poor and as discussed in chapter 6 could be seen as an elastic labor resource, manipulated by the rest of the population as a form of surplus labor. In the case of Chengue, the “poor” households would have had little chance to break the pattern of economic disadvantage that started when the founder households settled around the lagoon. This would inevitably result in permanent economic inequality (Netting 1993:197). The advantage held by the founder households seems to have set the stage for a hereditary social hierarchy. This complements the process outlined by Clark and Blake, because it implies that competition between aggrandizers leads to accumulation of resources. It also stimulates population growth that leads to environmental stress and heightens the disadvantages of parts of a relatively small portion of Chengue’s population. The process of social differentiation did not go on very long (part of the T1 phase) and did not result in the formation of strong political elite. Such an abrupt population growth is best explained as a bottom-up process where the involuntary effect of competing factions and cost/benefit decision making at the household level create a setting where opportunities for subsistence are finite and inequality becomes inevitable."
