The archaeological data indicate that much of this architectural complexity was in existence by Monte Alban II (100 B.C. through A.D. 200). Many of these buildings do not appear to have been residential and most likely served an array of religious (e.g., the various structures associated with two-room temples), military (such as Building J and perhaps the Ballcourt), and other "administrative" functions (including a variety of other public/institutional buildings the functions of which are still unclear). At the same time, it is probably also appropriate to consider the quihuitao (royal palace) to be another example of a public/institutional building. Both the main candidate for a quihuitao at Monte Alban (the Patio Hundido complex, according to Flannery) and also the example recently excavated at El Palenque (which was probably the capital of a rival independent state polity in Late Formative times) near San Martin Tilcajete (see Spencer and Redmond 2004 in Lat Am Antiq, and Redmond and Spencer 2017 PNAS) were not associated with tombs like other elite (and non-elite) residences; also, both examples had "residential" as well as "ceremonial/governmental" components. Note that the El Palenque quihuitao is securely dated to the Late Monte Albán I phase (300-100 B.C.)'.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Law">Law</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MxAlb3A&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Law">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Sources do not suggest there is evidence for a formal legal system during this period.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specialized_Buildings:_polity_owned">Specialized Buildings: polity owned</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=MxAlb3A&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Specialized Buildings: polity owned">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Communal buildings ♣ present ♥</b> Public buildings continued to be constructed at the Main Plazas of Monte Albán and secondary centres.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Special purpose house ♣  ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Utilitarian public buildings ♣ present ♥</b> "Markets clearly have a long history in Mesoamerica before Aztec times.

Most people were interred beneath the rooms or patio of their houses, although occasionally burials were located outside, but in the general vicinity of residences (figure 7.3). Urcid (2005:28- 44) shows how conjugal pairs who were the heads of households in each generation were successively interred in tombs or, in the case of some lower-status residences, in stone-lined cists. Archaeologists often find that Zapotec tombs, when opened and explored, contain a jumble of skeletal remains of many individuals along with offerings such as pottery and jade with few articulated interments. Urcid argues that these remains represent a sequence of household heads with the bones of earlier interments disarticulated and mixed due to later openings of the tomb for rituals and burial of descendants (also see Middleton et al. 1998). "Other members of the domestic group from infants to elders were interred in stone-lined cists, graves, and occasionally in reused pit features. High-status residences often included burials of adult females with elaborate offerings that Urcid (2005:40- 1) interprets as the secondary wives of male household heads, which is consistent with evidence for polygyny among nobles at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Neonates and fetuses were often placed within ceramic vessels and usually did not include offerings, suggesting that they had not achieved full adult personhood. These patterns mean that individual residences usually had several different kinds of interments, including at least one tomb. In houses occupied over long periods, the tomb might be expanded, or additional tombs constructed. "The architectural elaboration of the tomb as well as the quantity and quality of offerings found in tomb and non-tomb interments correlates with other indicators of status such as the size and quality of domestic architecture (Urcid 2005; Winter 1986:353- 61). Mourners often decorated the bodies with shell, bone, and greenstone ornaments, suggesting beautification and the marking of status or other social roles of the interred. Tombs and burials were accompanied by offerings of ceramic vessels, sometimes including urns that symbolized deities or ancestors. Dozens of vessels recovered from some tombs suggest the wide social networks of the deceased. In tombs, Zapotecs used red pigment to decorate the bones of earlier interments and at times bones of ancestors were removed for use as heirlooms in validating status (Urcid 2005:36- 7). People often performed sacrificial rituals as part of the mortuary ceremony with dog sacrifices associated with both commoners and nobles, whereas bird sacrifice was restricted to nobles. Interments of rulers may have at times included human sacrifice." <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> This is not stated by the source, but, judging from the likely importance of these rituals, as well as likely large families and relatively high mortality rate, these rituals were probably performed relatively regularly--and "yearly" appears to be a reasonably conservative estimate.

Joyce 2004:207- 11; Urcid 2005:154- 5). Genealogy became a key element of ideologies that legitimated the social position of corporate groups as well as rulers. Using Giddens’ (1979:193- 5) framework for understanding how ideology creates, maintains, and justifies sectional interests, genealogy can be seen as having reified status distinctions among corporate groups since the prominence of apical ancestors was fixed. The imagery presented apical ancestors of noble groups as instrumental in the cosmic creation and their continued propitiation was crucial to world-centering rituals. This belief universalized the social position of the nobility by making nobles intermediaries between commoners and the divine, since nobles were both descended from and had privileged access to important ancestors. Wealth and status was further reified since rights to property, privileges, and special offices were held via membership in the corporate group. Members of ruling houses, for example, had the right to engage in warfare, take captives, play the ballgame, and offer human sacrifices.

Most people were interred beneath the rooms or patio of their houses, although occasionally burials were located outside, but in the general vicinity of residences (figure 7.3). Urcid (2005:28- 44) shows how conjugal pairs who were the heads of households in each generation were successively interred in tombs or, in the case of some lower-status residences, in stone-lined cists. Archaeologists often find that Zapotec tombs, when opened and explored, contain a jumble of skeletal remains of many individuals along with offerings such as pottery and jade with few articulated interments. Urcid argues that these remains represent a sequence of household heads with the bones of earlier interments disarticulated and mixed due to later openings of the tomb for rituals and burial of descendants (also see Middleton et al. 1998). "Other members of the domestic group from infants to elders were interred in stone-lined cists, graves, and occasionally in reused pit features. High-status residences often included burials of adult females with elaborate offerings that Urcid (2005:40- 1) interprets as the secondary wives of male household heads, which is consistent with evidence for polygyny among nobles at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Neonates and fetuses were often placed within ceramic vessels and usually did not include offerings, suggesting that they had not achieved full adult personhood. These patterns mean that individual residences usually had several different kinds of interments, including at least one tomb. In houses occupied over long periods, the tomb might be expanded, or additional tombs constructed. "The architectural elaboration of the tomb as well as the quantity and quality of offerings found in tomb and non-tomb interments correlates with other indicators of status such as the size and quality of domestic architecture (Urcid 2005; Winter 1986:353- 61). Mourners often decorated the bodies with shell, bone, and greenstone ornaments, suggesting beautification and the marking of status or other social roles of the interred. Tombs and burials were accompanied by offerings of ceramic vessels, sometimes including urns that symbolized deities or ancestors. Dozens of vessels recovered from some tombs suggest the wide social networks of the deceased. In tombs, Zapotecs used red pigment to decorate the bones of earlier interments and at times bones of ancestors were removed for use as heirlooms in validating status (Urcid 2005:36- 7). People often performed sacrificial rituals as part of the mortuary ceremony with dog sacrifices associated with both commoners and nobles, whereas bird sacrifice was restricted to nobles. Interments of rulers may have at times included human sacrifice." <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ elite status is selected ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> While elite status was hereditary it is unclear if it could still be attained through other means.

From Phase 1: Assuming continuity with previous phases, public ritual at Monte Alban would have featured human sacrifice, divination, autosacrificial bloodletting, and ancestor veneration <sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup>. However, a number of important changes occurred around this time. "Commoners were increasingly excluded from the plaza. I suspect that largescale public ceremonies in the Main Plaza were less frequent, and when carried out the presence of elite residences acted as constant reminders of the control of the plaza by the nobility." <sup id="cite_ref-517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-517">[517]</a></sup> "The ways in which commoners and perhaps nobles from hinterland communities experienced the plaza would have been colored by memories of its earlier uses and symbolism (A. Joyce 2004, 2009a). The evidence suggests to me that commoners were less actively engaged in the kinds of ritual performances and shared experiences that created a sense of belonging and identity with the symbols, rulers, and institutions of the polity. If local nobles actively competed and attempted to undermine the authority of Monte Albán, then central unifying symbols, especially surrounding the rulers of Monte Albán, would have been further weakened. The Main Plaza may have embodied an increasing separation, and perhaps tension, between the identity of commoners and rulers as well as between people in the center and periphery. Residences were increasingly enclosed and inwardly focused during the Late Classic, which might reflect these rising social tensions and divisions, especially among competing nobles and/or between nobles and commoners (Hutson 2002:68- 9; Winter 1974). An unintended outcome of competition among the nobility and the disengagement of commoners from public ceremonies could have been to weaken the allegiance of commoners and lesser nobles to rulers and ruling institutions, especially to the distant rulers of Monte Albán.

Joyce 2004:207- 11; Urcid 2005:154- 5). Genealogy became a key element of ideologies that legitimated the social position of corporate groups as well as rulers. Using Giddens’ (1979:193- 5) framework for understanding how ideology creates, maintains, and justifies sectional interests, genealogy can be seen as having reified status distinctions among corporate groups since the prominence of apical ancestors was fixed. The imagery presented apical ancestors of noble groups as instrumental in the cosmic creation and their continued propitiation was crucial to world-centering rituals. This belief universalized the social position of the nobility by making nobles intermediaries between commoners and the divine, since nobles were both descended from and had privileged access to important ancestors. Wealth and status was further reified since rights to property, privileges, and special offices were held via membership in the corporate group. Members of ruling houses, for example, had the right to engage in warfare, take captives, play the ballgame, and offer human sacrifices. Status within the group was further reified as a function of a person’s proximity to the apical ancestor. Indications that important offices could be inherited, such as that of rainmaker and paramount sacrificer, suggest the means through which other nobles as well as commoners could be excluded from positions of power." <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup> "Commoners were increasingly excluded from the plaza.
