The rest of the empire can be grouped under the heads bhuati, mandala, zisaya, pathaka, chuturasitika and dvadesaka, bhukti was the biggest division. Next to it was the mandala. It was sub-divided into visayas; subdividion that we find also in feudatory States like Sakambhari. The pathaka stood next to it. The Varanasi Visaya had a division called Kasiparapathaka. .... it can be further concluded that the pathaka was a union of villages, the number of which could vary."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_InGhdvl] "The kotta or durga may be regarded as a representative of the durga constituent of a saptanga rajya.

Its secretary might have been designated Karanika."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_InGhdvl] An imperial officer, called tantrapala in a Harsa inscription of Vigraharaja II and some others, probably was tasked with "keeping the feudatories in check, looking after the interests of his master on the borders of his empire, and using diplomacy as well as force, to gain his objective.

There are even expressions where the palace wall is confused with the city wall and the castle gate with the city gate. Nonetheless, it would be a false conclusion were one to consider the royal residence, on the strength of this description, to be a citadel. We know from the narrative literature that it was easy to negotiate the moat and wall of the king’s palace by means of a pole or rope. The palace wall formed a police and not a military protection.

Instead of attacking the alien invader he waited to be attacked and paid the price in the battle of Chandwar. The victorious Muslim army advanced as far as Benares where 'nearly 1000 temples were destroyed and mosques were raised on their foundations'. The Gangetic valley was too large in extent, and too far from the invader's based of operations to be occupied effective within a few years.

The wealth and human resources of the Kanauj territory would have made it a formidable rival to any polity based in the Delhi-Haryana-Rajasthan region, and so the Raso's recollection of a war between Jaychand of Kanauj and Prithviraj of Delhi is eminently logical. While there is no independent testimony that the Chahamana and Gahadavala kingdoms actually had a major military conflict, it is certainly a plausible scenario.

"There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...] In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_123_InGhdvl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought equates rulers and commoners ♣ absent ♥</b> Caste system.

The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is.

It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition.

[...] Thus, [for example,] Krishna [...] is a form of the supreme God who creates, maintains, and destroys the universe. In the Bhagavad Gita , Arjuna is permitted to glimpse Krishna’s cosmic form. He sees the entire universe, the sun, stars, and planets, and all the people gathered on the battlefield within the body of Krishna. Krishna tells him that everything that exists is part of himself, but that he is not limited to everything that exists. In other words, just as the Vedic Purusha extended ten finger-lengths beyond the created universe, so too Krishna is the entire cosmos and more. [...] Equating a deity with Brahman naturally makes that deity supreme. But there were many gods and goddesses in South Asia and people did not simply give up their local traditions because they adopted a belief in one supreme Principle. Instead, Hinduism developed ways to include multiple divinities within the brahmanical philosophy. Thus, different deities came to be seen as manifestations of the one Supreme. The one Brahman took on all the diverse forms of the manifest universe and that included the various gods and goddesses found in regional traditions." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_165_InGhdvl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<b>Form of Morality</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> “According to Hindu Dharmashastras, of the four stages of life, the person who is at the householder stage is the anchor of society. The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grand- children and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving—dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have “cast off” from the settled world of “this shore.” ” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_166_InGhdvl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ present ♥</b> “Coming from the Sanskrit root word ‘’Dhar’’ (sustain), ‘’Dharma’’ has been interpreted variously as a religious code of behavior, a divine system of morality and righteousness, and conformation to one’s cosmically allotted duty and nature (Radhakrishnan, 1968). It is a comprehensive term, incorporating benevolence to humanity, moral restraint (‘’yama’’), and observance of duty or obligation (‘’niyama’’). ‘’Yama’’ required the active avoidance of violence (‘’ahimsa’’), dishonesty, falsehood, jealousy, avarice, and other vices.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_167_InGhdvl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown.

Not all Brahmins have been priests and not all Kshatriyas have been rulers. The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life. To that extent they would receive greater respect than Kshatriyas.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_168_InGhdvl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_169_InGhdvl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> “As a religiously informed orientation to life’s actions and obligations, dharma gives guidelines to how husbands, wives, children, and parents should conduct themselves. Many of the selections from sources included here advise their audiences on the roles proper for various situations and consider some of the complexities and ambiguities that arise in living according to their discipline. [...] Deeply embedded in Hindu notions of marriage is a disposition toward protection. It is the husband’s obligation to protect his wife from external predators and temptations and to invest in a relationship that will sustain her commitment to him and his world. At the same time, it is the obligation of the wife to protect her husband by feeding, caring for him, and investing in a relationship that will sustain his commitment.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_170_InGhdvl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> “Universal dharma relates to all humanity and it includes ethical virtues such as compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence.
