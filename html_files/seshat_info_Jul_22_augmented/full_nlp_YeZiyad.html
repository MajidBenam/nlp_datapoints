For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life.

For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” <sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes people from different locations ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “In Islam all men are equal, whatever their colour, language, race or nationality.

When these circumstances do not exist, polygamy ceases to flourish and monogamy is, as now, the norm.

[...] In the history of Islam, the first religious waqf was the mosque of Quba' in Medina. It was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad in 622. Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar.

But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word.

For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." <sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup> "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world.

The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are. Classical commentaries name secular rulers (umara' , sultan) as well as religious ahl al-qur'an wa-l-'ilm) or legal scholars (fuqaha').

To the true Muslim, man and woman alike, anything impure or degrading is abhorrent and to be avoided. Strict modesty of dress, manner and behaviour, and absolute chastity are required both before and after marriage. The most famous personal example of chastity in the Qur'an is the Virgin Mary: 'And (<i>remember that blessed woman</i>) who guarded her chastity' (21:91)." <sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to be kind to one's parents: <i>Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you show kindness to your parents.

And lower unto them the wing of humility and tenderness and say: 'Lord, be merciful to them both, as they did care for me when I was small.' Your Lord best knows what is in your minds. If you are righteous, He surely was ever Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). [...](17:23- 9)." <sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup> In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void.

The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."<sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft.

Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty.
