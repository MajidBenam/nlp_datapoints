The Gauls, like the Romans in their triumphs, selected the finest spoils. This is why neither arrows nor sling bullets - weapons of auxiliaries rather than warriors - are found in the sanctuaries. "These objects were carried into the sanctuaries with the greatest solemnity. A passage of Caesar suggests that all warriors together came to offer to the gods the spoils that each had taken. After the rites of consecration, about which we have no evidence, they were suspended on the walls of the sanctuary. And as the Greek word <i>anatithemi</i> suggests (originally 'suspend on the walls of the temple', later 'to consecrate'), this was the essence of the consecration. Weapons, together with human and cattle skulls, became untouchable offerings that remained suspended for decades, even centuries.

It is this specific type of hunt that will be coded here. "Arrian informs us that the Celts never hunted 'without the gods'. By that he meant that the hunt, like the war to which it was related , was a ritual activity that needed divine permission and assistance. "Arrian tells us that hunting was one of the Celts' favourite occupations and not simply a noble pastime. It was a daily level of skill and courage which involved many levels of society. The methods were diverse - on horseback, on foot, with dogs, or with nets. Among the Gauls, hunting became an art for which they remained famous throughout the Roman empire. "[...] "Religion was of course intimately linked with this occupation. To kill an animal had remained, since prehistoric times, a hazardous act that could not be carried out without the consent of the gods, or at least without the ritual precautions that took its place. "There are in effect three ways of putting an animal to death: the hunt, sacrifice, and butchery. The last was the rarest in antiquity. It was therefore in sanctuaries and at the hunt that animals were killed - domestic animals in the first case and wild ones in the second. There is no doubt that this method was the first form of sacrifice. It demanded the same ritual precautions: consent of the victim or the deity thought to represent it, and the reservation of part of the spoils for this same divinity. "The hunt also had a sporting character that was recognized by the peoples of antiquity. Thus the deity of the hunt was often linked with war; this was the case with Artemis in Greece, who was also <i>kourotrophos</i> (one who rears children); the initiation of youngsters was in fact done by means of exercises and hunting trials. In Gaul, where the cultivation of the body never attained the perfection that it knew in Greece, it is probable that the hunt mainly formed part of the apprenticeship of war. A youth had to confront nature and its savage denizens before being admitted into the society of men. "[...] "It is obvious from [a] passage [from Arrian] that the capture of game was regarded as a theft from nature, and one that had to be repaid. Its redemption was made according to a principle dear to the Celts and one that Caesar had already emphasized, that 'only a life can redeem a life'. Here it was domestic animals that were exchanged for wild ones."

However, the fact that it was a form of initiation [MAJIDBENAM_REF_237_FrTeneB] suggests that it only occurred once in one's lifetime, or that it occurred a number of times throughout a relatively short, post-pubescent phase of one's lifetime, which is effectively the same as "once in a lifetime".</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ substantial minority ♥</b> Warriors.

"At the end of the early Tene (c. 300 BC) the public sanctuaries, yielding evidence of regular and intense sacrificial activity, appeared in the north of Gaul. This event has a considerable sociological significance. "The sacrifices which took place there gathered together human groups that were previously separated, at least in cult matters: priests, warriors, peasants, craftsmen perhaps. They met here regularly, but above all they devoted a particular amount of their normal work to the production of goods that together they consecrated by destroying them. Even if the three agents of Indo-European society--priest, warrior and peasant--did not hold an equal place in these ceremonies, for the first time their goods were put together to form a sacred offering for the benefit of all. "The sanctuary is an indication of a people becoming aware of its unity and its component parts. It reveals the emergence of the notion of citizenship. The citizen participated in the cult, while the outcast was excluded. [...] In the middle La Tene it was in fact in sacred places that the full richness of this Iron Age civilization appeared. [...] In the middle La Tene, the time of the accounts of the first Greek travellers in Gaul, a true pantheon was established more or less everywhere. It was not the same for the whole Celtic world and its development varied from one people to another. Some of its constituents were ancient, but its organization was the result of the work of druids, who not only imposed order upon nature, but also tried to give it to the gods. However, the latter had status, personalities and origins that were too diverse and had in the end to represent all human preoccupations and activities. "It is likely that at the end of the middle la Tene (at the beginning of the first century BC) the Gallic pantheon had reached its full development. Celtic polytheism was at that point fairly close to Greek or Roman polytheism."

"In the Moselle region of Belgic Gaul, at Hoppstadten-Weiersbach near Trier, there is evidence suggesting that an entire family was interred together in the late La Tene period (Wightman 1970, 242). This could reflect the eradication of a complete family-unit as the result -perhaps- of an epidemic, but it could also represent the practice, recorded by Caesar, of the killing of ‘favourites’ alongside the deceased head of the family which, so he comments, only became obsolete a short time before his arrival in Gaul in 58 BC."

First, the importance of hierarchy at feasts: "Ceremonial did not only attach to the hearth, but extended more widely to social gatherings and general conviviality. Feasts accompanied by scrupulous ritual were its most elaborate manifestation. Posidonius gives the following account: '[...] When a large number dine together they sit around in a circle with the most influential man in the centre, like the leader of the chorus, whether he surpasses the others in warlike skills, or lineage, or wealth. Beside him sits the host and next on either side the others in order of distinction [...]." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_314_FrTeneB] Second, the prestige that the elites enjoyed in the all-important realm of war: "A noble was first and foremost one who possessed a mount and the complete panoply of a combatant: a sword in its scabbard, a shield and spears. [...] As warriors they had the greatest privileges, and they alone could take command in war. Commoners could only serve as infantry, and in the army clients were companions-in-arms of their lord." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_315_FrTeneB] This last point is particularly significant when considering the importance of bravery in Gallic ideology: "To fight was a duty and an honour; it was one way of doubly affirming a man's status as an adult and citizen." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_316_FrTeneB] Third: "The Celts did not have castes or anything that resembled them. Instead, it was lineage that counted for most and lent weight to the powerful. Kinship founded nobility, which was not so much a hereditary right as an inheritance painstakingly assembled by the ancestors." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_317_FrTeneB] However, no evidence of actual enforcement of respect for authority could be found. And even if respect for authority was enforced--which does seem likely--it's not obvious that this would have constituted enforcement of morality, as opposed to, for example, law enforcement, or, indeed, simple enforcement of the hierarchical order, with no connection to morality proper.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ purity ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "To fight was a duty and an honour; it was one way of doubly affirming a man's status as an adult and citizen."

The men are buried with their weap- ons—usually a spear, more rarely a shield and sword. The women have their jewellery—bronze anklets, bracelets, brooches and torcs. Gold is rare and confined to small items such as finger- rings. Except in peripheral areas, such as northern Italy, the Balkans or north-western France, burials with vehicles, exotic imports or large gold objects are unknown.

These fibulae pairs were used for fastening garments at the shoulder, while a third fibula was usually found on the chest. The right to wear a torc was apparently linked to social rank or status within the family.
