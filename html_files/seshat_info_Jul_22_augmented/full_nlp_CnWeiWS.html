The development of trade, occupational complexity, and markets created a class of merchants and private landlords.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_CnWeiWS] Iron tools were used for agriculture and the use of irrigation and fertilizer became more widespread.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_CnWeiWS] Intellectualism flourished, with the rise of Confucian philosophers Mengzi and Xunzi.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_CnWeiWS][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In the 5th century BCE, the state of Jin was divided into three states: Wei, Han and Zhao. Wei was one of the largest states of the period, ruling parts of modern Shanxi and later expanding to cover western Shandong and northern and western Henan.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_14_CnWeiWS] During the Warring States period, Wei mounted a number of successful military campaigns against neighbouring states, but fell into decline after a loss to Qi in 341 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_CnWeiWS][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The Warring States period ended with the rise of the Qin state and its defeat of the imperial Zhou court.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_CnWeiWS] Qin conquered the state of Wei in 225 BCE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_CnWeiWS][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Several of China's major political institutions were created during the Warring States Period.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_CnWeiWS] Zhou rulers were replaced by strong authoritarian rulers who governed independent territorial states.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_CnWeiWS] These territorial rulers commanded dependent officials, who were responsible for registering and mobilizing peasant households for military service.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_CnWeiWS][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It is difficult to find substantiated estimates for the population of the Wei state.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Editor ♣ DH ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=CnWeiWS&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ 90,000 ♥</b> km^2 Reference?</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ 400 ♥</b> km[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Daliang to northwestern edge of quasi-polity[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Note that: "Qin, Han, Zhao, and Wei moved their capital closer to their targets to facilitate expansionist campaigns."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_CnWeiWS]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hierarchical_Complexity">Hierarchical Complexity</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=CnWeiWS&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Hierarchical Complexity">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [4-5] ♥</b>pre-reforms (fifth c bce):[MAJIDBENAM_BR]1.

Some of these energies (qi) were associated with the emotions of the human, while the souls (the hun and po) were associated with the personality. Another component was the spirit (shen), which is what gave humans consciousness, as well as the ability to control things. While alive, humans would try to cultivate these energies and their spirit, trying to refine them and to keep them within the human body…. In short, if the ghosts of recently deceased humans were dangerous in the sense of being potentially angry and resentful against the living, the spirits (both the spirits of humans who died long ago, as well as the other spirits in the human) tended to be dangerous in another sense - highly powerful, but relatively indifferent to the needs of humans. The ghosts were potentially malicious toward the living, and the spirits were (from the point of view of the living humans) indifferent and potentially capricious….This is the background against which to understand early Chinese religious practices. The problem was clear: humans had to deal with dangerous recently deceased ghosts, as well as powerful spirits who tended to be unpredictable. The goal of early Chinese practices was to transform these figures as much as possible - or at least forge relationships with them - such that they would become more responsive to the needs of the living….For the recently deceased, the first concern was to separate the personality of the deceased from the spirit. Ritual actions would be undertaken to keep the souls of the deceased with the body, which would be buried in a tomb. The goal would be to keep the souls in the tomb, removed from the living. This would be accomplished in part through ritual exhortations that the souls not leave the tomb. It would also be accomplished by making the tombs places where the souls would want to remain. Things associated with the person in life (including food, texts, etc.) would be placed in the tomb, with the hope that the souls would therefore be all the more tempted to stay there, not rejoin with the spirit and not attack the living.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_149_CnWeiWS]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=CnWeiWS&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40" title="Edit section: Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Name ♣ royal tillage ♥</b> Historical sources do not clearly indicate which Zhou ritual attracted the largest number of people, but the annual royal tillage ceremony appears to be a likely candidate, since it featured a banquet where both elites and commoners shared food and drink.  "There were at least two early ceremonies related to agricultural activities. The ceremony of the Chi (the royal tillage) in the first month of the Hsia calendar symbolized the beginning of farming season. The Chi ceremony is recorded in bronze inscriptions, where mentions of a sacred, reserved in which ceremonies took pace are frequent. The most detailed description of such activities is included in the <i>Kuo-yu</i>. Nine days before the date of <i>li-ch'un</i>, the beginning of spring (February 4 or 5), The <i>T'ai-shih</i> reported on climate conditions to the king. Five days before <i>li-ch'un</i>, the king and participants began a fast, which lasted for three days. On the day of the Chi ceremony a banquet for all the participants, including ministers, officials, and farmers, was held. At the ceremony, the king, escorted by the T'ai-shih, the official in charge of agriculture, tilled the field symbolically by turning up one chunk of soil. Ministers turned up the earth three times; officials nine times; then the farmers worked throughout the entire sacred field. Another banquet for all the participants was held, and other related rituals included archery contests. For good harvest, the king prayed to God Ti. The crops collected from the sacred field were in time offered to the king, who in turn offered them at the temple of ancestors and gods. The grain from the sacred granary could also be distributed to needy farmers. [...]" [MAJIDBENAM_REF_150_CnWeiWS] Note: There is some scholarly disagreement on the evidence regarding royal tillage. Some experts believe that ancestor worship is most suitable for largest collective ritual of the official cult.

The chief sacrificer had to purify himself in advance through abstinence of varying duration. At the appointed time, he would enter the consecrated ancestral shrine, bow, prostrate himself, and make offerings of food and wine.

[...] The participants in such rites first purified themselves through fasting. After the composition of a written agreement (<i>zaishu</i>), the killing of an animal victim (referred to as <i>shen</i>) took place at an altar, following which its left ear was placed in one vessel and its blood in another. Blood was then sprinkled on the altar as a means of summoning the gods or ancestors, following which the text of the covenant was read. Each of the participants in the covenant then drank some of the victim's blood, or in other cases smeared the blood on his lips (<i>shaxue</i>). One copy of the covenant was buried in a pit (<i>keng</i>) containing the corpse of the animal victim, while the parties to the ritual also ratified their alliance (<i>limeng</i>). Another copy of the covenant was stored in an archive (<i>mengfu</i>) (Dobson 1968: 271-272). Dobson also cites the use of human blood, including in oaths between lovers to take care of illegitimate children (<i>ibid.</i>: 272-273, 278).
