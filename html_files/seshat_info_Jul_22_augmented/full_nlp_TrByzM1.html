This and other developments led to a dramatic transformation of Byzantium with regard to dimension and complexity of the society.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_TrByzM1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The signature change was the reform of Byzantine control of the regions with the introduction of themes introduced under Constantine IV 668-685 CE[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_TrByzM1] headed by commanders called strategi.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_TrByzM1] This was a progressive development as provinces still existed with the first themes, the last European theme (Nicopolis or Dalmatia) being set up about 900 CE.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_TrByzM1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Reform of the regions into themes was directly reflected with administrative reforms at the capital. At the professional imperial administration in Constantinople, taxation and military administration was 'fused' about 680 CE into a single office called 'logothete tou stratiotikou.' "In this office, taxation and military administration were made the responsibility of one minister in the central government. The officials concerned with the muster rolls of the soldiers and with the collection of the annona were thus combined in a single functionary."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_TrByzM1][MAJIDBENAM_BR]From Justinian II (r.668-711 CE) the strategi gained powers of tax collection and each individual theme had a logothete who behaved like the logothete tou stratiotikou in Constantinople.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_TrByzM1] "Thus there grew up this fusion of military and civil authority which spread over the whole Empire with the introduction of the themes and undermined the control exercised by the state."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_TrByzM1] However, while control from the center was lost, the Byzantines gained the ability to more flexibly respond to external threats.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]After the shock of losing 1 million km2 of territory by 700 CE to the expanding Islamic Caliphate the reforms eventually appear to have put the Byzantine state, and its 5 million inhabitants, on a stronger footing.

Such food industries as there were at this time were primarily concerned with the conservation of provisions such as fish, meat and fruit. Fish for export was partly dried, partly treated with fishflour, and was placed in linen sacks for sale. Other businesses in the same line prepared for export delicatessen items such as highly prized fish sauces. Meat was salted or made up into sausages. Fruit was either dried, such as dates, apples and plums, or was bottled with honey as a conserve. The most important branch of the late antique economy was the textile industry. It managed to keep its pre-eminence in economic life up to the eighteenth century ... it was necessary to import, particularly for luxury products. This was especially true of the silk industry which up to the beginning of the seventh century had to import raw silk from China. The Chinese silk had to be spun in Syrian and Egyptian workshops before it could be woven and made up. Side by side with Chinese silk there was Indian cotton which was another essential raw material used by the late antique textile industry. Then there was indigo, an important dye used in the textile industry, which had to be imported from India. ... factories (ergasteria) on the west coast of Asia Minor and in Cilicea whose raw material was the sheeps' wool supplied from the uplands of Anatolia. Workshops using dyes to tint their materials and garments only relied in part on foreign imported dyes. At this time there was indeed a chemical industry which produced successful imitations of the Indian indigo and the still more costly Phoenician purple. The genuine purple came from the murex, a shellfish yielding purple dye, which was found off the coast of Tyre, where there were special works producing this dye. Its manufacture was an imperial monopoly and its sale was severely restricted. A chemical substitute for this purple, called 'scarlet', was manufactured on the west coast of Asia Minor. ... Cyprus produced only napkins and sheets. Syria had a monopoly of fine spun materials. The products of the factories of Byblus, Scythopolis near Damascus, Laodicea, Tyre, and Beirut enjoyed an international reputation; they were largely exported and commanded a very high price on the foreign market. ... Chinese silk imported from Persia via Palmyra was woven to western taste by silkweavers (serikopoioi) in Syria; it was then dyed purple in the famous dye factories of Tyre in Phoenicia, and finally embroidered in gold in Alexandria in Egypt. ... it was possible to get cheaper imitations, such as the scarlet wool manufactured with chemical dyes in Nicaea in Bithynia."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_105_TrByzM1] "In the sixth century ... apart from provision businesses there were only a few other industrial activities important to the state which were obliged to be organized on the compulsory gild system.

To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_426_TrByzM1] "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_427_TrByzM1] "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers. A series of individual acts or turns were presented: these included dancers, wild beasts, clowns, and on occasion, some of the spectators themselves. Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor. It is not certain how these activities evolved over the years, but they were recorded as an important and popular part of the festivities during the tenth century."

Rural paganism was still alive here and there in the sixth century, but it was later eradicated leaving behind merely a few vestigial traces: ancient gods transformed into demons (and sometimes into saints?), festivals, fortunetelling. [...] But these festivals were mere deviations from the established rituals, and their participants, whether peasants or Constantinopolitans, considered themselves orthodox Christians, attended the liturgy, and partook of the Eucharist in their churches." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_489_TrByzM1] "Above all, a Christian was to go to church--not only on Sundays and other feast days, but as often as possible and at least two hours a day. What, indeed, could be pleasanter than attendance at church? Instead of diabolical songs and dancing whores, it provided the warbling of the Prophets, the chanting of the Seraphim, the words of the Gospel. Christ was there, lying on the altar table, the Holy Spirit was in attendance. The church was like a calm harbour in the midst of turmoil. Yet people had to be cajoled to go there. They found the service boring, and only the reputation of a famous preacher would draw them to church in their hundreds. But after applauding the sermon as in a theatre, they did not even bother to remain for the liturgy of the faithful." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_490_TrByzM1] In the absence of a detailed description of daily church service, information from the preceding quote may be supplemented by the following information on Byzantine liturgical ceremonies more generally. "Liturgical ceremonies involve the symbolic use of sensible objects such as bread, wine, water, oil, salt, candles, incense, icons, furnishings (altar, baptismal font), vesture (ecclesiastical costume, baptismal robe), edifices (church, baptistery, skeuophylakeion), and ritual gestures, or actions such as anointing, blessing, signing, bathing or washing, imposition of hands, touching, kissing, dressing or stripping, eating, processions, proskynesis, kneeling, and other postures. [...] The liturgy was usually presided over by a minister in priestly orders (bishop or presbyter) and directed by a deacon who regulated the gestures and posture of the congregation via instructions (diakonika) and announced the intentions of their prayer (litany). [...] Liturgical ceremonies contain both fixed and variable elements. The 'ordinary' is the basic skeleton that remains invariable regardless of the day, feast, or season. The texts of the ordinary express a service's changeless purpose; for example, vespers is always evening prayer. The 'proper' comprises those pieces (lections, hymns, psalmody, refrains, etc.) that vary with the day, feast, or season. Christmas Vespers is evening prayer in commemoration of the Nativity.

Rural paganism was still alive here and there in the sixth century, but it was later eradicated leaving behind merely a few vestigial traces: ancient gods transformed into demons (and sometimes into saints?), festivals, fortunetelling. [...] But these festivals were mere deviations from the established rituals, and their participants, whether peasants or Constantinopolitans, considered themselves orthodox Christians, attended the liturgy, and partook of the Eucharist in their churches." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_530_TrByzM1] "Above all, a Christian was to go to church--not only on Sundays and other feast days, but as often as possible and at least two hours a day. What, indeed, could be pleasanter than attendance at church? Instead of diabolical songs and dancing whores, it provided the warbling of the Prophets, the chanting of the Seraphim, the words of the Gospel. Christ was there, lying on the altar table, the Holy Spirit was in attendance. The church was like a calm harbour in the midst of turmoil. Yet people had to be cajoled to go there. They found the service boring, and only the reputation of a famous preacher would draw them to church in their hundreds. But after applauding the sermon as in a theatre, they did not even bother to remain for the liturgy of the faithful." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_531_TrByzM1] In the absence of a detailed description of daily church service, information from the preceding quote may be supplemented by the following information on Byzantine liturgical ceremonies more generally. "Liturgical ceremonies involve the symbolic use of sensible objects such as bread, wine, water, oil, salt, candles, incense, icons, furnishings (altar, baptismal font), vesture (ecclesiastical costume, baptismal robe), edifices (church, baptistery, skeuophylakeion), and ritual gestures, or actions such as anointing, blessing, signing, bathing or washing, imposition of hands, touching, kissing, dressing or stripping, eating, processions, proskynesis, kneeling, and other postures. [...] The liturgy was usually presided over by a minister in priestly orders (bishop or presbyter) and directed by a deacon who regulated the gestures and posture of the congregation via instructions (diakonika) and announced the intentions of their prayer (litany). [...] Liturgical ceremonies contain both fixed and variable elements. The 'ordinary' is the basic skeleton that remains invariable regardless of the day, feast, or season. The texts of the ordinary express a service's changeless purpose; for example, vespers is always evening prayer. The 'proper' comprises those pieces (lections, hymns, psalmody, refrains, etc.) that vary with the day, feast, or season. Christmas Vespers is evening prayer in commemoration of the Nativity. The texts of the proper are contained in a variety of different liturgical books."

To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_571_TrByzM1] "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_572_TrByzM1] "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers. A series of individual acts or turns were presented: these included dancers, wild beasts, clowns, and on occasion, some of the spectators themselves. Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor. It is not certain how these activities evolved over the years, but they were recorded as an important and popular part of the festivities during the tenth century." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_573_TrByzM1] NOTE: It was difficult to choose between this ritual and the imperial procession (described, for example, by McCormick [MAJIDBENAM_REF_574_TrByzM1]--but it does seem that chariot races attracted the largest number of people to a single location.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b>  semi-annually <i>closest magnitude we have to this in the Code Book at the moment is yearly</i> "The fixed chariot races only took place three times a year; but they were also put on to mark special events, such as imperial victories (McCormick 1986)."

The idea is already explicit in St. Paul: widowers are allowed to remarry but are not encouraged to do so (1 Cor. 7:39-40). Early Christian writers show a remarkable consensus in supporting that view: the consensus includes Ter- tullian, Athenagoras, the Shepherd of Hermas, Clement, and Origen. In the fourth century St. John Chrysostom composed a treatise addressed ‘’To a Young Widow’’, encouraging her to remain in her widowhood rather than succumb to human weakness and remarry. // Chrysostom's early contemporary, St. Basil of Caesarea, is the author of numerous letters, a number of which were accepted in the Byzantine Church as normative canonical texts and sanc- tioned as such by the Council in Trullo (692). He writes: "The rule establishes one year of excom- munication for those who marry a second time. Other authorities even require two years. Those who marry a third time are often excommunicated for three or four years. And such a union is not called marriage, but polygamy, or rather punishable fornication ... (noevd(av xExokaoptvriv)." This negative attitude toward second or third marriages is maintained in the ninth century by St. Theodore of Stoudios; recognizing that civil law authorized such unions, he forbids their blessing in church.'5 The canons attributed to Patriarch Nicephorus (806-815)16 also forbid the "crowning" of any marriage except the first.17 This principle, which forbade ecclesiastical sanction in cases of consecutive bigamy and trigamy, must have been challenged first in the case of emperors. In the ninth century Theodore of Stoudios deplores the evil example of Emperor Constantine V Copronymos, who was married three times.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_796_TrByzM1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Ideological thought reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The Byzantine Empire maintained a network of philanthropic institutions designed to shelter travellers and homeless migrants (‘’xenoi’’), provide free medical care for the ill, nurture orphans, and organize food allotments during famines (Constantelos 1991: 113).

It refers, most often, to the restraining of the specifically sexual appetites of the body, reflecting the word’s Latin root, ‘’castus’’ (‘pure’) which also has from ancient times retained a meaning of abstinence from sexual and other sensual activities. [...] With respect to sexual purity, chastity may refer in practical terms either to a complete abstention from all sexual activity (as in the case of monastics, or as the Orthodox Church expects of all persons prior to marriage), or to the right ordering and sacred engagement of the sexual appetites within the sacramental bond of married life. But chastity as a notion is often employed to the whole spiritual and bodily demeanor of purity before God, and is not simply referring to the sexual appetites. The curbing of any and all passionate impulses may be enjoined under the call to chastity (which is why, for example, it is included as the first positive petition in the famous prayer attributed to St. Ephrem and used throughout the Great Fast); thus chastity may relate to a right practice of patience, godly conversation, the fostering of right social attitudes and activities, the refraining from gossip and slander, etc. [...] Chastity may therefore be seen as the overarching virtue of rightly ordering one’s life and activities, bodily as well as spiritually, so that the other virtues might be realized and God’s temple, the human person, made a fitting home for its King.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_845_TrByzM1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “The warmth of relations between parents and children is often stressed in Byz. literature—in evident disregard for the demans of some rigorists (e.g. the author of the vita of St. Alexio homo Dei) who praised the dissolution of family ties.” [MAJIDBENAM_REF_846_TrByzM1] At the influential Synod of Gangra (ca. 340-342), "The council’s anathemas were promulgated against the following beliefs: [...](14) that women should abandon their husbands in contempt of marriage; (15) and (16) that parents should abandon children and children abandon their parents for asceticism; [...]"[MAJIDBENAM_REF_847_TrByzM1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Based on the following quote, it appears that, though bravery in defence of Christianity was seen as praiseworthy, good Christians were not supposed to engage in physical conflict, so that even soldiers, however brave, were sometimes condemned for their actions on the battlefield.  “To the Byz., peace and violence were ideals rooted in the teachings of the New Testament and church fathers (esp.

His staff included a range of powerful officials whose responsibilities ranged from fortification to street cleaning, from maintenance for baths and the hippodrome to water management. They sponsored markets and churches, monitored the scales, measurements and weights, issued regulations for buildings and guilds, maintained public order and provided a response to fires. The Praetorium was also the main police station which was close to courts and a prison. Legatarioi were officials who had a role in policing. They wee appointed by the exarch (with the emperor’s approval). Their duties included interdiction of smuggled goods and registering foreigners who entered Constantinople and ensured they did not stay more than 3 months. Armed officers called 'collegiati' were present on the streets armed with clubs and maces.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_881_TrByzM1] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_882_TrByzM1] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_883_TrByzM1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Police levels ♣ 5 ♥</b> The Emperor (1) appointed an Exarch - city prefect - of Constantinople (2) who ran a specialist administrative building (Praetorium) which contained high officials who worked on many aspects of city life.

Policing also involves white collar crimes like fraud so market inspection which may have been run out of a different office and had a separate chain of authority could be considered police work. There were probably sub-stations around and outside the city (4) as the exarch's authority extended beyond the city. At the lowest level were the 'collegiati' patrol men (5) who were armed with clubs and maces. The chain-of-command for market inspection is known to have five levels: Baileus - eparchos - symponos - legatarios - boullotes (the last in line policed instruments used for measuring and weighing and checked quantities that had the official seal).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_884_TrByzM1] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_885_TrByzM1] [MAJIDBENAM_REF_886_TrByzM1]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Proscriptions of elites and or property ♣ ♥</b> Use of the state to repress or purge rival elite groups.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Corporal punishment by the state ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Military control over independent or semi-independent vassal states ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> <i>Were the Ghassanids still officially a vassal at this time?</i> "the internal danger from the too-powerful military governors (strategi), whose loose dependence on the central power often resembles vassal relations, made it imperative to reduce the extensive stretches of territory under their rule.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_887_TrByzM1]</div><h1><span class="mw-headline" id="References">References</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=TrByzM1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=84" title="Edit section: References">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h1><ol class="references"><li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1"><span class="cite-accessibility-label">Jump up </span>↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">(Haldon 2008, 258) Jeffreys E, Haldon J and Cormack R eds. 2008.
