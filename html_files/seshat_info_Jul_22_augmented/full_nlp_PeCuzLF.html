[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_PeCuzLF]Bauer also refers to the existence of "important villages near the modern towns of Yaurisque and Paruro", in the Cusichaca area, in Chit'apampa and the Cuyo Basin, and a chiefdom in the Lucre Basin. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_PeCuzLF] "Since periods of chiefdom developmment are frequently marked by conflict as many roughly equal polities compete for dominance, it is possible that additional research in the Cuzco region will not only help us to better define the political divisions of the area, but will also bring forth evidence of conflict and alliance formations between the many different chiefly centers."

Traditionally, it has been subdivided into three periods. The Early Formative (2200-1500 BCE) corresponds to the beginning of ceramic production and quinoa cultivation and the establishment of large, permanent villages.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_PeCuzLF] During the Middle Formative (1500-500 BCE), Marcavalle ceramics appeared and villages grew, possibly leading to the beginnings of ranked village societies.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_18_PeCuzLF] The domestication of camelids was also under way.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_19_PeCuzLF] The Late Formative (500 BCE-200 CE) saw the emergence of a three-tiered settlement pattern in the Cuzco and Oropesa basins, dominated by the settlement of Wimpillay.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_20_PeCuzLF] This period is also known as Chanapata, in reference to a dominant ceramic style discovered in the 1940s.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_PeCuzLF] It is possible that other small chiefdoms existed in the region: a few early villages have been found near Raqchi in the Chit'apampa Basin,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_PeCuzLF] and there may have been some small independent polities near Paruro and Cusichaca.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_PeCuzLF] In the Lucre Basin to the east of modern Cuzco, a small chiefdom may have centred around the site of Choquepukio.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_PeCuzLF][MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The population of these early polities remains unknown, but over 80 archaeological sites dating to this period have been surveyed in the valley by archaeologist Brian Bauer.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_PeCuzLF] Some of these were identified as hamlets and small villages, with between a few dozen and a few hundred inhabitants.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_PeCuzLF] More research is needed in order to understand sociopolitical relations at the time, but Bauer has interpreted the Late Formative as the period in which chiefdoms begin to emerge.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_PeCuzLF] This process continued and solidified in the Early Intermediate Period.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ Edward A L Turner; Agathe Dupeyron ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_Scale">Social Scale</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=PeCuzLF&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Social Scale">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Polity territory ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> 100-200 squared kilometers.

To this sum, we can add thiry additional Late Formative sites in the Province of Paruro and those that have recently been found in the Cuzco Valley.

class='meatypart'><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Editor ♣ ♥</b>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Limits_on_Power_of_the_Chief_Executive">Limits on Power of the Chief Executive</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=PeCuzLF&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47" title="Edit section: Limits on Power of the Chief Executive">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3><div>These codes refer to an explicit or defined right for some group to constrain the activity of the executive in some way, typically through a legal code, but other ways are imaginable (explain in paragraph if other mechanisms found). When coding ‘present’ for each of the below codes, provide explanation and give examples of the constraints being used, or note that the constraints were formalized but are no known instances of its use in practice.[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Right to petition executive ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown.

There is a legal mechanism for removing and replacing the head of state[MAJIDBENAM_BR]While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. So there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used. Or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal critique of executive ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal sanction of executive ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal constraint on executive ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Informal impeachment ♣ ♥</b> Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In this section we are interested in whether religious or supernatural agents impose limits on executive power. These codes refer to both formal, legal restrictions as well as informal constraints including social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. Explain in descriptive section whether the constraint was formal or informal. ‘Religious agents’ here refers to religious groups, their leaders, or even religiously motivated individuals who are not leaders (e.g., Buddhist monks, street preachers)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Critique of executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Sanction of executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This refers to religious practices or norms that work to constrain the activity of the executive. This differs from the above code in that this code refers to restrictions imposed without the need for religious ‘agents’ specifically to act. For example, witchcraft accusations or the threat of such accusations could serve to limit the activity of political actors and act as a normative-behavior reinforcement.

In this position, code situations when chief executives take on personal costs or otherwise make prosocial or selfless actions where it is stated or believed to be because of internalized religious conviction. For example, a ruler dedicating war spoils to a temple rather than using them for personal benefit. Unlike the previous position (subordination), which can be theoretical, here we are looking for actual instances when leaders were motivated to do prosocial acts by religious considerations[MAJIDBENAM_BR] <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. There is a broadly agreed-upon or customary mechanism (although perhaps not explicitly spelled out in law – see below) for power transfer.

Provide details (e.g., specified in constitution)</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Number of power transitions ♣ ♥</b> All transfers of power of the chief executive/head of state, noting whether it was done according to an orderly, consensual mechanism, or as a result of contested action (e.g., rebellion, coup d’état). Enter the total number of transitions here and list each one in the paragraph. Note Dynastic transitions where applicable</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Number of contested transitions ♣ ♥</b> How many transitions were contested (out of the total entered above), regardless of which party won the contest (i.e. incumbent or contesting agent). 1. We do not count as a contested transition any challenge that begins after 365 days have elapsed of the new reign. Caveat: care must be taken to record cases just after the cut off. We want to know when the conflict started. The reign end date of the previous ruler only tells us when the contest ended. Though a major event (e.g. a battle) can occur one and a half years after the new king's coronation the infighting/contest that lead up to it often begins earlier, such as immediately after the accession, or sometime within the first year. That infighting can be ignored by any historian who wants to simplify the text to mention only the battle. 2. Multiple separate contests within the transition timeframe should be counted as ONE contested transition. (Do not take time searching for the details of multiple separate contests but if all the detail is present in the same text opportunistically record it in the description field). 3. A transition can be contested before the new ruler is officially crowned.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Number of successful overturns ♣ ♥</b> How many contested transitions of power resulted in an overturn of the ruler. This includes breaks in the normal line of succession (i.e. a dynastic succession was broken, a different party or ethnic group took power, or a rebellion resulted in a change to the rules or procedures regarding powers transitions) or when a relative overturns the ruler unexpectedly within the expected line of succession. Note: There will often be 'succession crises' when there is no 'normal line of succession' so that there will be a 'contested transition' with no possibility of a successful overturn: i.e. 1.
