the apex of the reign of King Ahab, shortly before he participated in a regional coalition against the Assyrian Empire at the Battle of Qarqar c. 853 BCE. While the hard historical evidence of the battle's outcome is slight, it is known that the Assyrian campaign did not proceed further south afterwards, and only retook the territory four years later. Nevertheless, Ahab died shortly after the battle and many subject kingdoms rebelled upon his death, including Moab and Edom.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_2_IlYisrl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1030-722 BCE ♥</b>The early date is speculative, being approximately when the first consolidated monarchy was established by the Israelite people (traditionally assumed to be that of King David; non-Biblical evidence for his rule is thin but nonzero, for example the stela at Tel Dan.)[MAJIDBENAM_REF_3_IlYisrl] The later date is approximately when the Assyrian Empire conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel and exiled many of its inhabitants.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥</b> This is uncertain. While the region featured frequent civil war, there are no independent records or biblical traditions of powerful noblemen or the like with any territorial bases or autonomy. However, much of local administration seems to have been performed by tribal elders; and it is possible that taxes were collected within each region.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_4_IlYisrl] Pfoh (2008) argues that Israel was actually a "patronage kingdom" in which the monarchy did not control a truly unitary state.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ personal union: 1050-930 BCE; none: 929-875 BCE; alliance: 874-842 BCE; vassalage: 841-728 BCE; alliance: 727-722 BCE ♥</b>The timeline here largely follows Kelle (2007:21-23). During the initial period, Israel is presumed to have been joined to the Davidic monarchy (or a regime with the same practical effect), which is taken to be a personal union between Israel and Judah.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_5_IlYisrl] Circa 930 BCE, the Northern Kingdom splits off and develops into a separate regime; during the time of Omri and Ahab, Israel dominates its immediate neighbors and participates in an anti-Assyria regional coalition. Circa 841 BCE, Jehu seizes the throne and pays tribute to Assyria. For the next century, Israel is in a constant state of vassalage to either Assyria or Aram, as their respective political fortunes wax and wane. Finally, in 727 BCE, Israel joins in a regional rebellion against Assyria that ends with its dissolution as a polity.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ preceding (quasi)polity ♣ Ancient Phoenicia ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ population migration ♥</b> The Israelite settlements first are found in hilly, desolate regions of the highlands that had little previous settlement during the Canaanite heyday, perhaps as refuges from the domination of surrounding powers such as the Philistines.

This represents the roughly-estimated area of both the Northern and Southern Kingdoms.

Tirzah: 950-900 BCE; Samaria: 899-722 BCE  Dates are approximate; the century-points are correct. "The book of 1 Kings (12:25) says that Jeroboam I built Shechem, but it also hints (14:17) that he later moved to Tirzah; 1 Kings specifically mentions Tirzah as the capital of the northern kingdom in the days of Baasha (15:21, 33; 16:6), Elah (16:8-9), Zimri (16:15), and the  first half of the reign of Omri (16:23). Assuming that Jeroboam ruled at least part of his reign from Tirzah, as did his son Nadab, as well as Tibni, Tirzah was the seat of the  first six or seven northern kings, for a period of forty to fifty years. I see no reason to doubt the authenticity of the consistent and deeply rooted information on Tirzah as the capital of Israel. The authenticity of this memory is highlighted by the fact that Tirzah does not play an important role in the rest of the Deuteronomistic History."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_IlYisrl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Tirzah lost its importance in the early ninth century, when Omri (884-873 b.c.e.) moved the capital of the northern kingdom to Samaria, possibly in his desire to establish a link with the coastal plain and the port of Dor (de Vaux 1967, 382). Indeed, the beginning of the transformation of Israel into a more complex kingdom came with the construction of the first palace at Samaria, probably by Omri. A full-scale urban transformation of the capital and the kingdom characterizes the more advanced phase of the Omride dynasty, probably in the days of Ahab (873-852 b.c.e.)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_9_IlYisrl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Language ♣ Hebrew ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Linguistic family ♣ Afro-Asiatic ♥</b> Semitic[MAJIDBENAM_BR](Note: this map is one of many purporting to show Israel's approximate borders; they all vary somewhat, and should not be taken as authoritative.)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Short description_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The ancient kingdom of Israel 1030-722 CE was a monarchy established by Israelite people that was eventually conquered by the Assyrian Empire. Initially a monarchic union with Judah, around 930 BCE the Northern Kingdom (Israel) gained autonomy. In the 9th century Israel entered an anti-Assyria coalition but from Jehu (841 BCE) paid them tribute and thereafter were frequently a vassal of the Mesopotamian empire. After a revolt against Assyria in 727 CE the Assyrians ended the polity sending many of its inhabitants into exile.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]The century authorities ruled through administrative centers and fortresses sites that had "public buildings and ... large open spaces."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_10_IlYisrl] Local administration may have been through tribal elders who may have been responsible for tax collection. Our image of a centralized monarchy (for some of or the whole of the period) might be tempered by the ideas of Pfoh (2008) who has argued Israel was actually a "patronage kingdom" in which a monarchy did not control a truly unitary state. Nevertheless, Israel possessed a standing army with a strong chariot corps, and used weapons of iron and bronze. Fortifications were many and imposing, and the Palace of Omri was one of the grandest in the Ancient Near East.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At its height, Israel imposed tribute on many of the surrounding kingdoms, not only Judah but Moab, Edom, and perhaps others as well. The Israelite population primarily lived in cities and towns in the hills, with fortified cities protecting the frontiers on the plains and dominating major trade routes through the region. Trade linked Israel with its northern neighbor Phoenicia, particularly through the port of Dor. At the height of its power, Israel was also a significant military force, contributing the largest contingent to the regional coalition that turned back Assyria's first attempt to conquer the Levant.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At least some of the population was literate even before the 10th Century BCE, though the prevalence of literacy is disputed. While the majority of the populace lived in small towns and villages, a significant fraction lived in walled cities such as the capital, Samaria. Most of the economy was in agriculture and pastoral production; staples for export included grain, wine, and oil. In the eighth century BCE the population likely exceeded well over a quarter of a million people, a vast increase on the less than 100,000 people estimated for the earliest times.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]_Oren's long description_[MAJIDBENAM_BR]How the Kingdom of Israel began is a matter of dispute. The Bible depicts it as originally being the greater part of the old Israelite tribal confederation, and then a part of the United Monarchy under Saul, David, and Solomon (c. 1030 BCE)—before seceding during the rule of Rehaboam, and forming its own state. This narrative is more or less accepted by some archaeologists such as Mazar, while others such as Finkelstein assert that Israel actually emerged first from a process of gradual state formation, with the southern kingdom of Judah emerging later.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_11_IlYisrl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Regardless, the two kingdoms always had close interactions, and the northern kingdom of Israel was almost always the dominant one. At its height, Israel imposed tribute on many of the surrounding kingdoms, not only Judah but Moab, Edom, and perhaps others as well. The Israelite population primarily lived in cities and towns in the hills, with fortified cities protecting the frontiers on the plains and dominating major trade routes through the region. Trade linked Israel with its northern neighbor Phoenicia, particularly through the port of Dor. At the height of its power, Israel was also a significant military force, contributing the largest contingent to the regional coalition that turned back Assyria's first attempt to conquer the Levant. Israel featured a standing army with a strong chariot corps, with weapons of iron and bronze. Fortifications were many and imposing, and the Palace of Omri was one of the grandest in the Ancient Near East.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]However, starting with the assassination of the Omrid king Jehoram by Jehu (c. 841 BCE), Israel's fortunes waned; and it spent the rest of its existence as the tributary of either Aram or Assyria, depending on which of the two empires were ascendent. Even when the economy of Israel flourished during particular periods of the next century (as attested to by the greater incidence of luxury goods in archaeological finds), Israel was still subject to the depredations of foreign powers, being invaded several times. Ultimately, following an ill-fated rebellion against Assyria, the polity of Israel was dissolved (c. 722 BCE), its people exiled, and the land turned into an Assyrian province.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Israelite politics were marked with instability. In contrast to the kingdom of Judah, which featured a single ruling dynasty that traced its beginnings to David, Israelite kings frequently met violent ends. These would typically be at the hands of rebellious military commanders who would seize the throne, though such rebels ran the risk of being deposed themselves in short order. Zimri, one rebel captain, would rule for only a single week before losing the support of the army to rival captain Omri, founder of the Omrid Dynasty.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]At least some of the population was literate even before the 10th Century BCE, though the prevalence of literacy is disputed. While the majority of the populace lived in small towns and villages, a significant fraction lived in walled cities such as the capital, Samaria. Most of the economy was in agriculture and pastoral production; staples for export included grain, wine, and oil.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]A word of caution is in order about coding methodology. Much of the evidence we have about this polity comes from archaeological finds. However, the brute fact of an archaeological artifact is often used as the basis for considerable interpretation and conjecture. Methods have been improving over time, but still some archaeologists tend to leap far ahead of what the evidence will support. Additionally, the meaning of many finds is hotly disputed by archaeologists, each faction insisting for its point of view.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Worse, scholars of this particular polity often operate with ideological motives - either to prove the essential historicity of the Bible, or to disprove it—which can distort their claims. Israel Finkelstein, for example, once claimed that King David never existed, before having to revise his view after the discovery of the Tel Dan Stela.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_12_IlYisrl] (He now <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2010/12/david-and-solomon/draper-text">believes</a>, as <i>National Geographic</i> puts it, that David was "a raggedy upstart akin to Pancho Villa.") His "Low Chronology" seems to have been motivated by the attempt to disprove the early existence of the United Monarchy, and the weight of the evidence now contradicts the chronology (while still inconclusive on the matter of the United Monarchy).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_13_IlYisrl] In general, it seems that many archaeologists treat the absence of evidence as evidence of absence—risky to do, considering that new finds are unearthed practically every month.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]In short, every data point that is backed up with archaeology must be considered provisional, and new discoveries can totally upend our picture of what happened.

The surveys, mainly those conducted in the 1980s, revealed a massive wave of settlement that swept throughout this region in the Iron I (Finkelstein 1988; 1995; Zertal 1994; Ofer 1994).  The main concentration of sites can be found in the northern part of this region, between Jerusalem and the Jezreel Valley.  The settlement process may have started in the  final phase of the Late Bronze Age (the late thirteenth or early twelfth centuries b.c.e.), accelerated in the early Iron I (the late twelfth to mid-eleventh century), and reached its peak in the late Iron I (the late eleventh and  first half of the tenth centuries b.c.e.). In the late Iron I there were approximately 250 sites in this area (compared to ca. 30 sites in the Late Bronze Age), with a total built-up area that can be estimated at roughly 220 hectares (ca. 50 hectares in the Late Bronze Age). Using the broadly accepted, average density coefficient of two hundred people living on one built-up hectare in premodern societies, the late Iron I population can be estimated at circa 45,000 people."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_15_IlYisrl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Estimation of population is based on the results of surface surveys; if done properly, the collection of pottery sherds at a given site can shed light on the size of the site in every period of habitation. Accordingly, one can draw a settlement map for a given period with all sites, classified according to size, and compute the total built-up area. Deploying a density coefficient (number of people living on one built-up hectare in premodern, traditional towns and villages), it is possible to reach the total number of inhabitants.  The population of [the Northern Kingdom of] Israel on both sides of the Jordan River in its peak prosperity in the middle of the eighth century can accordingly be estimated at 350,000—three times larger than the population of Judah of that time (Broshi and Finkelstein 1992)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_16_IlYisrl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]It should be noted that these estimates are highly speculative, and there is reason to believe that they underestimate the true population by a considerable amount. "Some of the densities recently put forward for area coefficients have been based on unwalled, premodern villages…. How similar is such a village to a walled Bronze or Iron Age town or city? Although this is not a case of comparing apples and oranges (more like oranges and grapefruit), it seems probable that the economic constraints of building a defensive system put a permanent physical limit on the settlement area," leading to higher population densities.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_17_IlYisrl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [15,000-20,000] ♥</b> "The estimated area of Iron Age II Samaria according to Kenyon… is 70 hectares, with an estimated population of 17,000.

The agglomerated village type consists of individual buildings, or complexes of several buildings, with streets of varying width and irregular open areas left between the individual units. The edges of this village type are open, and living space is relatively close and restricted.

In larger centers, such as Tel Dan, the paved plaza outside the city gate was a more developed locale—though the stalls for such a marketplace could still be temporary and the traders might only occasionally visit. Perhaps the most developed attempt to outline a local extramural market center would be the recent work of Yifat Thareani, who argues that the public building at Tel Aroer, containing an unusually large number of weights for measuring silver, served a commercial function (2011: 161-73, 301-4)."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_31_IlYisrl]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ food storage sites ♣ present ♥</b> "The ostraca house at Samaria received goods from clans across the territory of Manasseh (Reisner, Fischer, and Lyon 1924, with modifications in Tappy 2001: 497, fig. 84).

The part of the palace that was exposed (foundations of walls only) is circa 55 x 40 m in size.

It would only be considered part of the present polity if it were indeed built during the presumed United Monarchy period, for if it were built later it would have been after the kingdoms divided and thus would be part of a separate polity. Furthermore, its dimensions as described in the Bible would make it smaller than the Palace of Omri, and it would only qualify as "most impressive" if its building materials were more costly than those of Omri (e.g. overlays of gold etc.), which cannot be verified.

Casemate walls could be used as soldiers’ dwellings, or to store food or weapons that could be used in case of siege. Sometimes the stone casemates served as a framework, which was filled with earth. From the Divided Monarchy onwards massive walls are more frequent. The earliest type is the inset and offset type, built with sections of around 6m long that alternately project and recede.

For example, the Assyrian Kurkh Monolith of Shalmaneser III describes the events of the Battle of Qarqar, and puts Ahab's contingent at 10,000 infantry and 2,000 chariots. However, the Assyrians were known to exaggerate the numbers of their foes, so as to heighten the achievement of victory or explain away losses.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_82_IlYisrl] Other explanations for the apparently overlarge army exist. “A better explanation can be derived from the fact that Assyrian records of this battle make no mention of Israel’s immediate neighbors of Judah, Moab, and Edom, kingdoms described elsewhere as being under the influence, and perhaps even under the control, of Israel during this period…. Thus, another possible explanation for the size of Israel’s forces at Qarqar is that kingdoms like Judah, Moab, Edom, and perhaps Phoenicia contributed contingents that were counted under the banner of Israel.”[MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_IlYisrl] Army sizes given in the Bible are considered by scholars to be equally exaggerated. Partly this is because they do not match well with scholarly population estimates of the time (though see above about the reliability of such estimates), and partly this is by analogy to the observed boasting of other ANE monarchies such as Egypt and Assyria.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Professional army ♣ [1,000-10,000] ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Largest fielded army ♣ [5,000-15,000] ♥</b> Assuming this to be the Battle of Qarqar, see above note.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Maximum logistical lag ♣  6 ♥</b> Dorsey[MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_IlYisrl] estimates that the average travel speed for Israelite armies was about 15 miles (24 km) per day.

'Official' here can be somewhat flexible -- it can mean supported by the state, or simply the ritual system most widely practiced, or (for practical reasons) jus thte system we happen to know the most about </span> Notably, the Bible states (I Kings 12:24-29) that the monarch of the seceding Northern Kingdom severed its links with the Jerusalem cult, setting up new cults instead to bolster his power. Later, King Ahab is portrayed in the Bible as having sponsored the worship of Phoenician deities, but the extent to which this sponsorship lasted, and the practices involved, are unknown. "Regardless of the identity of the deities that were worshiped in northern shrines (see, e.g., Köckert 2010), in the ninth century cult had not yet been centralized, seemingly not even at a given site. Archaeological evidence of cult at Samaria is lacking, and the same holds true for Jezreel."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_98_IlYisrl] Archaeologists such as William Dever also believe that the "folk" religion was quite different from the "official" religion, with most of the archaeological finds relating to the former.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_99_IlYisrl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]In general, however, we can say that inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom most frequently worshipped local deities, either Canaanite or Phoenician (for example, in II Kings 1, King Ahaziah is depicted seeking an oracle from Baal-Zevul of Ekron), with many cultic figurines having been found throughout the region; as well as YHWH, localized to various places such as "YHWH of Samaria" and "YHWH of Teman".[MAJIDBENAM_REF_100_IlYisrl] Whether this use of YHWH implies continuity with the older Canaanite deity El, or is a syncretism of a distinct Biblical religion, is disputed by scholars. Animal sacrifice was clearly a part of religious ritual; some scholars argue that all meat needed to be consecrated to a deity before eating. It is likely that human sacrifice was practiced at times,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_101_IlYisrl] but the archaeological evidence for same is inconclusive.

Oren Litwin ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Editor ♣ ♥</b>Coding the regime and political-culture variables of Phase II for this polity has significant difficulties. While many scholars have undertaken subtle analyses of the Israelite political culture,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_102_IlYisrl] these analyses are usually based on the Bible—both because of its later historical significance, and because it is simply the only comprehensive source we have for the time period. But the Bible is an imperfect source for the Phase II variables. Its concerns are not anthropological and it often silently assumes that the reader is familiar with existing cultural practice; as a result, it rarely describes the cultural features we are interested in explicitly. Furthermore, many scholars believe that the Bible was written centuries after the fact, as we noted above, rendering its use as a source problematic.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]On the other hand, even with the least sympathetic understanding of the Bible's historicity, we can at least say that it records a representation of the political memory of the times being written of. This is particularly the case since the Bible records political institutions that are startlingly different from those of the consolidated monarchies and empires surrounding Israel: chiefly, the pre-monarchical tribal confederation, and the conceptually limited monarchy, who does not make the law but is (in theory) bound by it in the same way that the common folk are. This latter concept was so unique that the Biblical tradition would provide the direct impetus for the growth of constitutional government in early modern Europe.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_103_IlYisrl] It is unrealistic to suppose that such novel institutions would be invented out of whole cloth by a later writer, at a time and place (e.g. Babylonia) when the legitimacy of absolute kings was unquestioned; that gives us some confidence that the depictions are, at least in outline, reflective of some reality.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Meanwhile, the Bible itself records that Israelite culture retained several features of the older Canaanite one, and that several kings tried to import political institutions and ideologies from surrounding polities such as Assyria in order to buttress their own authority. Thus, the lived experience of political institutions was likely different from the "ideal" system laid out in the Mosaic law, even in the best case.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Therefore, in coding the following variables, the Bible will have significant weight, but need not be the final word.

To date, no surviving legal documents or references to legal proceedings have been found from this period by archaeologists. Even the Bible does not fully describe the legal system; however, it seems that each significant town had some sort of justice system "at the gate of the city," administered by local זקנים (elders);[MAJIDBENAM_REF_108_IlYisrl] I Kings 21 also includes an obscure category of notables called חורים (sometimes translated "nobles" or "prominent ones," literally "the pure, distinct, or shining ones," with the post-biblical meaning of "freemen") who took part in judicial proceedings. Priestly figures may have played some unspecified role as well, perhaps by administering supernatural ordeals in unusual circumstances. Guilt, according to biblical accounts, was primarily determined through testimony of at least two witnesses. The final verdict lay with the presiding judges. There is no reference to prosecuting or defending advocates.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Additionally, several Biblical texts suggest that patriarchal heads would render judgments on matters internal to the family, up to and including capital punishment (e.g. Genesis 38). This would be consistent with other Middle-Eastern tribal societies down to the modern era. It is unclear where the authority to do so came from—whether it was recognized by the "official" law of the land, or whether it was a set of customary practices in opposition to the "official" law.

If it did, it has no ideological justification at all in the Bible, whose ideology is broadly egalitarian. Surrounding cultures were, however, strongly stratified; so it is conceivable that Israelite kings may have tried to set up a nobility to reward their supporters. Ahab had his גדולים, "great ones" (II Kings 10:11), and other texts reference חורים, often translated as "nobles," but whether these actually reflected a hereditary nobility or simply prominent men is totally unknown. During the United Kingdom succession struggle of Solomon and Adoniyahu (depicted in I Kings 1), the key supporters of each side are priests, prophets, or military men; but that does not exclude a nobility arising later. (Relatedly, whether royal bureaucrats were selected or hereditary is also unknown, though families of powerful royal bureaucrats are attested to in the Southern Kingdom;[MAJIDBENAM_REF_116_IlYisrl] and the line between "noble" and "bureaucrat" is fine indeed.)[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Kessler[MAJIDBENAM_REF_117_IlYisrl] identifies the עמי הארץ ("people of the land") of the Southern Kingdom as a "landed aristocracy." Prominent and powerful people they certainly were, but to be a true aristocracy one must not simply have power, but some sort of formal caste privilege, for which evidence is unclear. But here we get to a question of definition: if one's father is wealthy and that wealth passes on to you, does that count as a "hereditary elite status" in our present sense?

However, that shared vassalage also meant that no individual had standing to oppress another, and underwrote a religious claim to something akin to egalitarianism (patriarchal, to be sure).[MAJIDBENAM_REF_124_IlYisrl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The picture of Canaanite religion is often drawn from the texts found at ancient Ugarit (in spheres outside religion, however, most scholars do not include Ugarit within the scope of Canaan). While the Ugaritians distinguished themselves from Canaanites, Ugaritic religious literature has enough links with later biblical literature to place Ugarit on a cultural continuum with Canaan.… A large number of male and female deities was worshiped throughout the area, known from Ugarit, the Bible, various Canaanite personal names, and inscriptions. The high god 'El, the father-god, head of the council of gods, lived on top of a mountain at the foot of which was the source of fresh water. Of the same 'generation' was Asherah, a marine goddess ('atiratu yammi at Ugarit); the gods at Ugarit are called her children and she is called creator of creatures.… These deities demonstrate continuity with those of the national religions of the Iron Age: Yahweh in Israel, for instance, is a storm god as well as an 'El figure (patriarch, head of the council). There is no evidence that Chemosh in Moab, Milkom in Ammon, and Qaws in Edom were any different. In fact, there is some slight evidence that they were similar; they were also national gods from the same time period, and the onomastica are similar; and the Mesha stela shows Chemosh leading Mesha in war and requiring a kind of 'holy war' destruction."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_125_IlYisrl][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"The four ranks in [Canaanite] society - royal, noble, peasant, and slave - were mirrored by four tiers of gods (Handy 1994; M.

In the second rank were the cosmic gods, who ruled aspects of the natural realm such as the storms that fertilized the land, the lights in the sky, the endlessly chaotic sea, the vast earth, and the eternal underworld. On the third level were the gods who assisted with practical aspects of daily life, such as gods of craftsmanship, gods of childbearing, and the family ancestors who had become gods after death.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_127_IlYisrl] "The rise of David as king over all Israel and his selection of Jerusalem as his political and religious capital plays a foundational role in the conceptualization and development of ancient Israelite religion because it establishes a close interrelationship between the Davidic kings and YHWH. This interrelationship is evident in YHWH's promise of an eternal dynasty to David immediately after David brings the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem in 2 Sam. 6. According to 2 Sam. 7, David had thought to build a “house” or Temple for YHWH once he had become king, but the prophet Nathan came to David and declared that YHWH did not desire a “house.” Instead, YHWH would build a “house,” i.e., a dynasty, for David so that his descendants would rule forever in Jerusalem. David never built the “house,” or Temple, for YHWH in Jerusalem, but his son Solomon did and thereby established the Davidic monarchy and the Jerusalem Temple as the two primary institutions of ancient Israel or Judah.

According to the story, the patron god, Yahweh, is angry, but not because David has raped and murdered (Noll 1999, pp. 35 -6). Yahweh expresses disgust that David has taken the wrong man’s wife, for he, Yahweh, is eager to give David the wives of other men if David desires them (12:7b-8). As punishment for David’s sin, the woman’s child shall die and another man shall rape several of David’s other wives (12:9-14). The moral values of Canaanite culture are clearly on display in this tale: the divine patron punishes a man by killing a child and orchestrating the rape of other women.

Polygyny, as the marriage of the same man to two or more wives with the same legal status, is distinct in scripture from concubinage, in which a man took secondary wives (usually foreigners or women of lower social standing). It is distinct, too, from a sexual relationship between a free man and a slave woman of his household, which seems to have been unrestricted…. Although the scriptures presuppose that polygyny is valid, they invite the reader to regard it with suspicion.… Deuteronomy 17:17 counsels that a king should not have many wives lest his heart be distracted. Solomon’s downfall is attributed to his having many wives and concubines, although his attachment to foreign women may have been the chief source of his troubles (1 Kgs 11:1-6). The polygamous marriages of Esau, Elkanah, and Jacob were marred by favoritism and by discord among wives. The story of Abraham, his wife Sarah, and her foreign handmaid Hagar (Gen 16) drives that message home, although Hagar was presumably only a sexual partner, and not Abraham’s wife in the proper sense (notwithstanding Gen 16:3).
