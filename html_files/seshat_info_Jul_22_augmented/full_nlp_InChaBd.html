[...] [the] First reason is that Brāhman scholars, and priests within Brāhmanical temples, generally did not understand or value festival religion. Festival religion had its roots within the non‐Brāhmanical communities that were traditionally not allowed to worship within the Brāhmanical temples; in many ways it represents an alternative religious form to that offered within the Brāhmanical temples. [...] Second, the festivals have been neglected by scholars because in the nineteenth century when western scholars began the study of Hindu religion, they looked primarily at texts." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_192_InChaBd] Therefore, a generic "large-scale festival" has been reconstructed on the basis of data collected by Younger.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_193_InChaBd] Much of this data relates to the present, as well as to regions (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka) located farther South than the chosen NGA. However, Younger appears to imply that his observation would apply to South India more generally, and, regarding the antiquity of certain festivals, he writes: "Each chapter in this study is a description of a particular festival that is still celebrated. Nevertheless, in some festivals participants insisted that the festival had been celebrated in exactly the same way since preagricultural times and that the hunting symbols providing the basic structure of the celebration were taken from the everyday occupation of the early celebrants. While I was skeptical at first, and made determined efforts to find external evidence to date the celebrations, in the end I found the internal evidence convincing, and suspect that the festivals structured around preagricultural ritual symbols might well be quite old." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_194_InChaBd] The following are a number of generic observations that may well apply to large-scale festivals as they were celebrated throughout Indian history: "The deities have been invited to share in the celebration of the community, but there is no certainty that they will come. Stone temples in South India were built like fortresses with a number of concentric walls around the 'seat' of the deity, or 'seats' of the deities. Priests fed, bathed, and worshiped the deities within these temples daily, and landlords or kings who made major donations for building the temples could arrange for worship within one of the corridors. However, for the mass of the people, entry to the temple was restricted and the primary worship of the deity took place on festival occasions. For the deity to come out of the temple into the community was a major event and involved transferring the power of the deity into either an utsava ayūdha (festival instrument) or an utsava mūrti (festival image). Sometimes this transfer itself is a frightening experience, but the utsava form of the deity is thought to have a totally different personality and can be known only in the context of its encounter with the festival crowds. Priests fed, bathed, and worshiped the deities within these temples daily, and landlords or kings who made major donations for building the temples could arrange for worship within one of the corridors. However, for the mass of the people, entry to the temple was restricted and the primary worship of the deity took place on festival occasions." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_195_InChaBd] "In North India the primary form of popular religion is 'pilgrimage', but individual ritual features such as ecstatic behavior, healing, and large excited crowds are common in both North Indian 'pilgrimages' and South Indian 'festivals.' What distinguishes the South Indian form of popular religion from similar North Indian forms is the more elaborate social arrangements that are part of the South Indian festival.' The 'Dravidian' marriage arrangements characteristic of South India permit marriages with first cousins on the mother's side. This arrangement helped keep land within the larger family network and led to the creation of tight endogamous caste groups. To operate in the economic, political, and cultural arenas, these relatively small caste groups needed forms of common social interaction with others, and festivals provided one of the most effective forums for social interaction. Of course, other structures of social interaction define everyday economic and political relations among the castes, and psychological and religious dimensions of festival activity transcend the social, but South Indian 'festivals' have a specific social function in both reflecting and redefining social structures. This distinguishes them from the more diverse 'pilgrimage' traditions so prominent in North India."

Of course, other structures of social interaction define everyday economic and political relations among the castes, and psychological and religious dimensions of festival activity transcend the social, but South Indian 'festivals' have a specific social function in both reflecting and redefining social structures.

While objects were offered into the fire in the Vedic rites, objects were offered to deities on altars in temple Puja. In the Puja system the items were meant for the enjoyment of the deity rather than as offerings tendered for a tangible (or intangible) benefit of the patron or community. As Davis recounts, 'in Puja, a worshipper invokes or invites the deity into some material form, most often an image or icon visually and symbolically representing the deity, and presents to him both material offerings such as food and clothing and devoted services such as the recitation of his praises, music, dance, and songs. Agama texts classify all these material and performatory presentations to the deity as "services" (Upacara). Vishnu and Siva, as gods simultaneously transcendent and immanent, enter into a variety of both anthropomorphic and aniconic objects so that their devotees may see them and make their offerings of homage.' "In Puja the divine service always takes place in reference to an altar upon which are placed statues or images (Murti) requiring regular worship. Puja in temples and shrines gradually developed into a complicated daily service that was enhanced during special monthly and seasonal observances. Puja is generally centered on pleasing the Lord in the temple with offerings of food, water, incense, flowers, fan, sweets, camphor, lamp wick, unguents, and conch. Music and devotional songs were key items in this arsenal of offerings.

"With respect to the fundamental characteristics of the Vasantotsava as found in the above Sanskrit texts, we can fruitfully focus our attention in four general directions. Firstly, the Spring Festival crosses sectarian boundaries. It is a popular festival celebrated by several sects as well as outside any readily identifiable sectarian context. No main deity or group of deities is here the consistent object of devotion; the Vasantotsava may be celebrated by all, regardless of private or public devotional affiliations. Second, the element of fire appears in some context in almost all descriptions of this festival: it is a symbol of death, renewal, transformation and purification. Third, the significance of the marriage motif with respect to the Vasantotsava is indicated by a number of texts including the Bhavisya Purana (as previously noted). [...] Fourth and finally the rituals of the Vasantotsava revolve, to a greater or lesser extent, around sensuality. The festival is a fertility festival and erotic motifs from both the mortal and the immortal realms are freely combined with fertility motifs. These four components of the Spring Festival will be treated in turn in the sections that follow. "[...] "The eroticism of the spring celebrations as found in the Ratnavali is characterized by a certain amount of social freedom and licentiousness. Thus the Spring Festival is a peculiar mix of control and freedom: the festival occurs within the city under the auspices of kings and Brahmins and at the same time social barriers are purposefully broken down and the erotic permeates the ritual. The breakdown of social relationships is indicated by rituals such as playing 'Holi' (throwing colored powder), mixing of castes and men and women in the streets, sex, licence, and powder. Eroticism and sexual licence as brought out in the throwing of powder and dancing which comprise this festival reflect the sexual potency of the season."

However, the vast majority of the scholarly literature, at least in English, focuses uniquely on dysphoric rituals that are performed by individuals, often in isolation--e.g. particularly extreme forms of Jain fasting rituals, or Aghori corpse meditation. Collective dysphoric rituals exist in contemporary South India, and some of them appear to have particularly ancient origins. Of course, it is problematic to assume that contemporary South Indian rituals have been the same for hundreds, or even thousands, of years. However, at this early stage of the Seshat enterprise, it is acceptable to use "low-hanging fruit", as we wait for experts to look through the data and confirm or deny the validity of our choices. Moreover, this is what anthropologist Paul Younger [MAJIDBENAM_REF_359_InChaBd] writes on the subject of the antiquity of certain rituals: "in some festivals participants insisted that the festival had been celebrated in exactly the same way since preagricultural times and that the hunting symbols providing the basic structure of the celebration were taken from the everyday occupation of the early celebrants. While I was sceptical at first, and made determined efforts to find external evidence to date the celebrations, in the end I found the internal evidence convincing, and suspect that the festivals structured around preagricultural ritual symbols might well be quite old." The ritual coded here is a pilgrimage ritual, loosely based on the pilgrimage to the Sabarimalai shrine of Ayyappan in the mountains of Kerala. The following is a detailed description of this pilgrimage. Though it is unlikely that this ritual was performed exactly the same way in ancient India, it seems reasonable to infer that groups of young men performed arduous and possibly dangerous journeys to remote shrines, as a kind of initiation into adulthood. "For either 41 or 51 days (there seems to be a difference on how long the vow should hold) a small group (I observed groups as small as three and as large as fifty) is bound together in the three activities of preparation, travel, and celebration. [...] For the duration of the pilgrimage, this small group cuts itself off from the rest of society and tries to leave all distinctions of age, status, or any other form of social identity behind. Acting as one unified personality, they assume the personality of an exuberant male youth familiar with the forest. "For a rather high percentage of the participants, the 'first‐timers' (kaṇṇis), the entire exercise is an initiation, much like Manikantha's when he went into the forest for tiger's milk just before he was to be crowned as yuvarāja. Probably in years past this initiatory aspect of the pilgrimage was more central, and almost the whole of the ritual was an initiation of South Indian youth. Even now, most of the preparatory rituals are much like initiation rites. "The most important step in the preparation is saying the solemn vow in the home‐town temple. For this ceremony a large number of family members usually accompany the participant to lend their support. The vow involves a promise to wear a black lungi (a dramatic contrast to the usual white one worn by South Indian men), to eat only the simple fruits and millets in the forest, to abstain from sexual activity, and to grow a beard. The vow is sealed by the wearing of a rudrākṣa necklace. The group takes this vow together and thereby place themselves under an experienced spiritual guide, or periyaswāmi, who will take charge until they return. "Under the strict guidance of the periyaswāmi, the trip begins with each kaṇṇi wrapping up a two‐compartment packet (irumuṭi). The front compartment holds items for the final act of worship (a coconut filled with ghee, dried rice, betel leaves, arecanuts, and a coin), and the back compartment holds other coconuts for worship along the way and more rice and gram for the pilgrim's consumption. The packet is carried on the head throughout the trip. Once the packets are ready, the periyaswāmi leads the group off toward the mountains, visiting as many temples as he can find along the way. All along the way (under some periyaswāmis for 24 hours of every day), antiphonal chants ring out (called the śaraṇam viḷi) varying the name from 'Ayyappaṉ śaraṇam' ('I take refuge in Ayyappaṉ') to 'Swāmiye śaraṇam,' to 'Śaraṇam Ayyappaṉ,' until the participants are dazed and participate in the nonstop activity of the group with blind impulsiveness. "When the group reaches the little town of Erumeli at the edge of the forest, the second‐year swāmis paint the kaṇṇis in colored paints and require them to perform the wild petta tuḷḷal dance until they reach uncontrollable frenzy. After this, the initiates are again warned that the forest is full of tigers and wild elephants and reminded that the trip involves the climbing of steep slopes and the swimming of turbulent rivers, so that only those spiritually prepared are likely to live. Thus prepared, the group undertakes the last part of the pilgrimage, which involves walking through the dense forest for 4 days and 45 kilometers of arduous climbing. "Finally the pilgrims arrive at the long‐sought wondrous shrine. There the noisy crowd becomes an object of reverence itself, and the cries of thousands constantly ascend. Gradually groups line up at the 18 steep stone steps before the temple, and in a last cry of exuberance throw ghee‐filled coconuts against the stone. Then, with the assistance of anchored ropes and calm police constables standing on carefully braced platforms, the worshipers climb the sacred steps and enter the quieter confines of the temple. There they watch in wonder as the priests pour the ghee from their coconuts over the image of Ayyappaṉ. In a surprisingly short time, they head for home. "One of the most notable features of this festival, which distinguishes it from all others I know in the area, is that women are not allowed to participate. Women were not allowed to participate in the past because the central ritual is really a male initiation rite that tests the young man's ability to stand up to the rigor of a dangerous forest."

"There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...] In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’.

The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is.

[...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions - Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sīta. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala."

By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them.

The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

[MAJIDBENAM_REF_475_InChaBd] "The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled <i>Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications</i>. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste."

The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others.

One may conclude that while Varadaraja and Devaṇa saw dishonesty by these professional as mere financial bungling, Mṇdhava took their misconduct more seriously." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_481_InChaBd] However, it seems that Hindu Law had only a nominal link to Hindu precepts, and does not therefore count as "human enforcement of morality":  "The growth of law in India may be likened to the evolution of disciplines like grammar, poetics, etymology, and prosody etc. Early speculations on these started in the samhitās and gained strength as auxiliaries to the Vedas.

Second, it seems that, in Hinduism, punishment or reward for certain behaviours was believed to occur mainly through reincarnation, not through the action of other humans: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths. According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life. Then, after a certain amount of time, the individual would be reborn on earth once again. The mechanism that regulated this system was karman, a word that literally means "action."

Many of the selections from sources included here advise their audiences on the roles proper for various situations and consider some of the complexities and ambiguities that arise in living according to their discipline. [...] Deeply embedded in Hindu notions of marriage is a disposition toward protection. It is the husband’s obligation to protect his wife from external predators and temptations and to invest in a relationship that will sustain her commitment to him and his world. At the same time, it is the obligation of the wife to protect her husband by feeding, caring for him, and investing in a relationship that will sustain his commitment." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_487_InChaBd] However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for mistreating one's parents. Instead, it seems any punishment or reward was believed to occur through reinarnation: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths.

They dance before the beasts, leap on to their rough backs and embrace them like garlands, and dance upon their backs. One embraces a bull, 'crushing out its strength' and clasping it around the neck; another 'lies on the side of the bull'; while another catches a charging bull by the ears and thus quells it ... For all these exploits the youths are garlanded with various flowers and the performance is accompanied by drumming.
