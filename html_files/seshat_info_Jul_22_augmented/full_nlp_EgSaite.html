They include: 1. A renewed "quest for new religious solutions which emphasized individual salvation. Generally, people were perhaps less optimistic that a virtuous life would bring them a blessed eternity, and more reliance was placed on the gods as a source of comfort. Traditional preparations for the afterlife continued, but people were also determined to enjoy their daily pleasures while they were still alive." <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> 2. "Although weak and foreign dynasties tried to revive the myth of the god-king in order to support their royal status, the political power of the king continued to decline, along with his influence on religion." <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> 3. An "increased association between the temples and lay people. One noticeable feature was an increase in the custom of setting up personal statues inside the temples so that the owners could benefit from the regular rituals for the gods (which were the same as those performed in earlier periods), and thus receive sustenance from the divine food offerings. It also emphasized the owner's devotion to the god, and gave him a claim on the deity's attention. This tradition emphasized the fact that the gods were now regarded as better guarantors of individual postmortem protection than the age-old mortuary cults." "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> 4. "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Because it doesn't seem that these changes affected most of the variables we are interested in, it seems reasonable to infer continuity with earlier periods in terms of equality, prosociality, slavery, human sacrifice, and morality. Indeed, the the first millennium BCE was characterised by a "deep-rooted revival of things past that affected many aspects of Egypt's court culture, religion, script, literature, art, architecture, and burial practices." <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Religion ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Genus ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion Family ♣ ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Alternate Religion ♣ ♥</b>If scholars are in disagreement over whether Egypt of the Kushite Empire experienced a period of centralized rule, this undoubtedly did occur during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664-525 BCE),<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> which has been called the 'Saite Renaissance'. The Saite kings, from their palace at Memphis,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> gradually managed to construct a considerably more centralized state than that of the preceding period.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The high point of Saite power was the reign of Amasis II, whose administration commanded sufficient revenues to enable him to build a fleet to conquer Cyprus.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> An important phenomenon of this period was the development of the Demotic script (from the Greek word <i>demos</i>, 'the people'), which originated in the delta but spread throughout Lower and Upper Egypt under Psamtik I and his successors.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Based on Hieratic, a cursive script using simplified Egyptian hieroglyphics, Demotic was useful in everyday contexts such as accounting, letter-writing and non-religious literature, which grew in importance during the period.[MAJIDBENAM_BR]<i>Population and political organization</i>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Upper Egypt, which before the Kushites had long been ruled by a militarized priesthood, was always a difficult nut for the central administration in the Nile Delta to crack. At first, the main influence the Saites had over the Twenty-fifth Dynasty aristocracy at Thebes was through the priestly position of the God's Wife of Amun. This was held by a Saite priestess at the Amun temple, and an observer (<i>rsw</i>) based in Thebes who was often called 'governor'.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Established in the Kushite Period, the God's Wife of Amun role was of 'very great and publicly acknowledged' political importance.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]To increase their hold over Egypt, Saite strategy, under the first ruler Psamtik I, sought the removal of the nome system of administration; instead a military official was directly appointed to oversee the whole Southern Land (covering the region from Aswan to Memphis).<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Named leader of the fleet and based in Herakleopolis, this official also acted as the 'revenue accountant for Middle and Upper Egypt'.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> The Saite king ruled from Memphis, where there was a High Council of aristocrats who reported directly to him.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> The vizier acted as the supreme judge of the realm.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> In the Late Period, almost all officials were also priests<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> and oracles featured in the elections of officials and even of kings.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> The military was usually led by the supreme chief of the expedition,<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> but under Amasis II the chief physician also occupied important military roles such as 'leader of the Aegean foreign (troops)' and 'admiral of the royal fleet'.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>[MAJIDBENAM_BR]Theban Egypt was not brought under the effective control of the Memphite kings until Psamtik II's campaign against the Kingdom of Napata between 592 and 591, which ended what had essentially been a 'period of compromise' in Upper Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Before that time, Saite authority was so weak that they were forced to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Kushite pharaohs of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty.

And for the greatest of the festivals the king came to Thebes in person to be at the centre, and to absorb some of the power that the occasion generated. "This most important of festivals was the Festival of Opet. It came round every year, in the second month of the season of Inundation. In the mid-18th Dynasty it lasted for eleven days. By the end of the reign of Rameses III in the 20th it had been lengthened to no less than twenty-seven days. At that time at Medinet Habu the festival was celebrated by the distribution of 11,341 loaves, 85 cakes, and 385 jars of beer. The core of the festival was an unusually long procession of images of the holy family of Thebes. The route lay between Karnak itself and the temple of Luxor (Figure 97, p. 266). In the time of Hatsheput the outward journey was made by land, using the newly built southward extension of courts and pylons at Karnak, pausing at six way-stations, whilst the return journey was by river. By the late 18th Dynasty both the outward and the return journeys were being made by river. Each of the deities travelled in a separate barge, towed by smaller boats and by gangs of men on the bank, who could include high court officials, hauling on ropes. It was one of the occasions when the public could present pleas to the gods before their portable barques, and before colossal <i>ka</i>-statues of the king (see below for the meaning of <i>ka</i> [divine essence - EC]). Detailed scenes of the processions, depicting also the soldiers, dancers and musicians who followed the progress of the barges from the bank, were carved on the walls of Luxor temple, the destination of the festival. "[...] The procession of the Opet Festival took the king to the temple. Leaving the crowds outside he entered and proceeded in the company of priests to the enlcosed chambers at the back. There, in a charges incense-laden atmosphere and the mystic presence of the god Amun (and his ithyphallic manifestation Amun-Min), the king and his <i>ka</i> were merged, and the king's person transformed. When the king reappeared, he did so miraculously transformed into a divine being, 'Foremost of all the living <i>Kas</i>.' His reappearance in public freshly transfigured was the real climax, the moment of cheering which implied that the miracle had worked and had been accepted as having worked." <sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup> The following relates to festivals more generally: "Commoners could participate by witnessing a sacred performance, by communing with the gods through prayer and oracles, or simply by singing, dancing, and feasting. For ordinary Egyptians, festivals were a time of sensory stimulation through sound movements, scents, and the nervous anticipation of being in the company of the divine. Festivals were community affairs, a time for the residents of a village or town to abandon their daily tasks and come together in celebration. [...] Their repeated commemoration was part of the rhythm of life, providing security through predictability. This was particularly true of the celebrations marking the renewal of the king (such as the Opet or the Decade Festival), which symbolized the victory of order over chaos. [...] "Festivals also served to bolster state control and promote royal ideology. [...] The Opet and Sed (jubilee) festivals specifically commemorated the renewal of the king's power. [...]. "Festivals presented logistical and economic challenges. They required huge amounts of bread, beer, wine, and precious incense, and the preparation for the larger festivals involved massive mobilization of people and resources. If the king was to attend, the additional needs of the members of the royal court had to be met. This apparently meant that citizens could be subject to an unreasonable requisitioning of supplies. The Edict of Hormheb (Dynasty 18) expressly forbade the 'agents of the queen's estate' from harassing the 'local mayors, oppressing them and searching for the [supplies] for the trip downstream ... each year during the [festival of Opet].'

His festival was celebrated in the fourth month of inundation, from the twelfth to the thirtieth day, when the Nile receded and crops began to sprout - a potent natural symbol of resurrection. The festival is known as Khoiak, after the name of the month in which it was celebrated. It is known from Middle Kingdom texts (the Ikhernofert stela and texts of King Neferhotep) and from a great number of private stelae and Middle Kingdom monuments from Abydos. Though we lack the overall 'script' for the festival, because the earlier records refer only to isolated events, later records, including Roman-era texts from the walls of the rooftop chapels of the Temple of Hathor at Dendera (Fi. 21), provide a fuller account of the Khoiak festival. "[...] "Unlike the localized Opet or Decade festivals, which were celebrated only in Thebes, the Khoiak Festival was celebrated throughout the country. The broad geographic spread of the festivities commemorated the dispersal of the parts of Osiris's body across all parts of Egypt. [...] "The festival had two major components, both of which provided opportunities for public participation. The first part of the festival was a dramatic reenactment of the death and resurrection of Osiris and the defeat of his foes. This was performed before the public, much like a Christian passion play. [...] The religious drama followed a set script, laid down on a papyrus scroll that kings could cite to prove the authenticity of the festivals they held.  [...] The second aspect of the festival was the manufacture, procession, and ceremonial internment of Osiris figurines. New images of Osiris, his ennead (the eight gods associated with him), and the jackal god Wapwawet were made, and sacred boats, sledges, and shrines were constructed to convey the divine statues through the necropolis. "During the festival, the king was supposed to play the role of Horus, the faithful son who avenged the murder of Osiris. However, Middle Kingdom accounts indicate that the king appointed a surrogate to represent him during the festival, just as the First Priest of the god acted on behalf of the king in daily temple rituals (see Chapter 3). At Abydos, the priests claim to have played the role of deities, but we do not know whether they donned costumes or simply stood as representatives of the gods. Some parts of the ritual enactment took place in the temple to which the public had no access. Other parts took place where the gathered crowds could watch and participate. "The festival began with the arrival of the royal delegation. Within the dark confines of the Osiris Temple, a priest offered myrrh, wine, and other 'divine products' to 'Osiris, in all his identities.' The official Ikhernofert claimed that within the temple of the statue of Osiris was embellished with lapis, turquoise, gold, and 'all precious stones' and was clothed with garments. The statue was then placed in a new naos of gold, silver, copper, <i>sesnedjem</i>-wood, and cedar. Construction of the naos and of the god's boat was overseen by Ikernofert himself. "These preliminary acts complete, the procession set out from the temple and made itself visible to the waiting throngs. It set out through the necropolis, led by the statue of Wepwawet (especially appropriate, because his name means 'Opener of the Ways'), who acted as the protector of the gods. Dramatic tension was fueled by a reenactment of the attack on Osiris by the company of Seth, which retold the story of Osiris's murder on 'the sandbanks of Nedit.' [...] One can imagine the screams and groans from the assembled onlookers as the two factions clashed and Osiris was slain. As in passion plays, this sequence always concluded with the triumph of good, as the priest representing Horus defeated Seth's company. In his speech of victory, he proclaimed: 'I avenged Wennofer (Osiris) on that day of great fighting, and I felled all his enemies in the sandbanks of Nedit.' "The victory of Horus was followed by a 'great procession' simulating the sorrowful funeral of Osiris. [...] "Once at the tomb of Osiris, participants enacted the funeral rites and recited an invocation to Re - 'Come down to me!' - to bring the life-giving forces of the sun back to the dead god. Several references to dancing suggest that some of the ritual dance, perhaps to celebrate the victories of Horus and Thoth, was performed. Finally, the procession returned to the Osiris Temple, and the statue of the god was restored to its shrine. "The public participated in the festivals of Osiris through their observation of the procession presented during Khoiak but also in more personal and intimate ways, especially through the creation and manipulation of images of the mummiform god. [...] "Some of these figurines were made during the Khoiak Festival, kept for a year, and then ritually buried, whereas others became a part of an individual's funerary equipment." <sup id="cite_ref-281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-281">[281]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> "Osiris, the primary deity of the dead and the legendary first ruler of Egypt, was a god who symbolized eternal rebirth through the story of his own resurrection.

[...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the sun rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-320" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-320">[320]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times." <sup id="cite_ref-321" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-321">[321]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> Relatively detailed contemporary descriptions do not mention audiences, as suggested by Teeter's summary of the ritual <sup id="cite_ref-322" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-322">[322]</a></sup>.</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> "Texts indicated that the priests who assisted in the daily offering service were drawn from the ranks of <i>wabs</i>, lectors, and God's Fathers, all of whom, in some time periods, were part-time priests (see Chapter 2).

The first record of the feast dates to Dynasty 11. The festival was most popular in the New Kingdom, the Ramesside Period, and Dynasties 25-26, but there are references to the festival as late as 117 BC during the reign of Ptolemy VIII. By that time, however, the festival had likely changed character, taking on more Osirian overtones. [...] "The focus of the festival was the parade of statues portraying the gods and deceased royalty (Plate VIII). [...]  The procession, led by the king, was accompanied by throngs of priests who carried the great fans signifying the presence of the deity and by huge crowds of locals. [...] "Graffiti note that priests watched for the procession from the heights of the west bank. It must have been an exciting and prestigious duty, for some of the priests recorded that they stood lookout for several years in a row. One the flotilla was spotted, mobs of people who lived on the west bank joined the crowd that had followed the procession from the east. Everyone was dressed in his or her finest white linen clothing, clutching flowers and food offerings as they greeted the 'divine arrival' as it moored on the west bank. "[...] People crowded around the pageant clamoring for a view of the gods. One can imagine the roadways and canals of the west bank lined with people laden with bouquets of flowers and baskets of offerings, and crying out in honor of the gods. "[...] "During the first day of the festival, the procession wound its way through the necropolis. The musicians and onlookers made - intentionally - a lot of noise, for according to the texts, those buried in the western necropolis harkened to the sound of the procession. The clamor enlivened them and caused them to emerge from their tombs to see Amun and to meet with their families. "During the festival, priests could participate by carrying the divine boat or walking alongside it, holding the broad fans that announced the divine presence. A much larger number of ordinary people took part as well, by observing the procession and enacting rituals at the family tombs. For them, the most important aspect of the Feast of the Valley was the sensual communion between the living and the dead that took place at the tombs. "[...] The properties of smell, sound, and taste were thought to be capable of transcending the barrier between life and death to reach the deceased and bring him or her into the celebration. These senses were further stimulated by copious amounts of beer and wine, which created an ecstatic state and brought the living closer to he dead. The revelers called on Hathor, addressing her as the 'Lady of Drunkenness.' The families encouraged each other: 'For your <i>ka</i>! Drink the intoxicating drink! Celebrate a beautiful day ... may your heart be refreshed in your house [i.e., tomb].' "The necropolis was filled with activity, noise, smells, and music. Fueled by alcohol and the excitement of the festival, the living recited hymns to their ancestors' statues to encourage the spirits of the deceased to enliven them; 'Emerge from the earth! Behold Ra and follow Amun in his beautiful Feast of the Valley!' The spirits were encouraged to join the procession: 'May you be in the crew of the royal boat and may you hear the clamor in the temples in wester Thebes. May you see Amun in the Beautiful Feast of the Valley and follow him to the temple precincts.' "Bands of musicians circulated through the necropolis visiting individual tombs. Women shook beaded necklaces (<i>menat</i>) and clanged their metallic rattles (sistra) (see Plate III) both instruments sacred to Hathor, while male musicians clapped and sang, creating a hypnotic rhythm that reverberated among the tombs. Their refrains continued into the night[...]" "The odor of food filled the necropolis. The dead were presented with fragrant roasted birds and meat. Sweet myrrh oil was poured on the meats, making the scents even more alluring. [...] "Another source of sensory stimulation was the enormous, fragrant bouquet of flowers, called an <i>ankh</i> (a pun on the word <i>ankh</i> that also means 'life'), that each family presented to its deceased ancestors (Plate X). [...] "All these rituals were enacted to produce an ecstatic union of the dead and the living - to bring the living into the realm of the dead and the dead back to the living." <sup id="cite_ref-359" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-359">[359]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> "The Feast of the Valley was observed once a year, on the first day of the second month of summer in conjunction with the appearance of the new moon." <sup id="cite_ref-360" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-360">[360]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> "The Feast of the Valley was observed once a year, on the first day of the second month of summer in conjunction with the appearance of the new moon." <sup id="cite_ref-361" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-361">[361]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> "The Feast of the Valley was observed once a year, on the first day of the second month of summer in conjunction with the appearance of the new moon." <sup id="cite_ref-362" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-362">[362]</a></sup></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ 48 ♥</b> hours.

They include: 1. A renewed "quest for new religious solutions which emphasized individual salvation. Generally, people were perhaps less optimistic that a virtuous life would bring them a blessed eternity, and more reliance was placed on the gods as a source of comfort. Traditional preparations for the afterlife continued, but people were also determined to enjoy their daily pleasures while they were still alive." <sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> 2. "Although weak and foreign dynasties tried to revive the myth of the god-king in order to support their royal status, the political power of the king continued to decline, along with his influence on religion." <sup id="cite_ref-582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-582">[582]</a></sup> 3. An "increased association between the temples and lay people. One noticeable feature was an increase in the custom of setting up personal statues inside the temples so that the owners could benefit from the regular rituals for the gods (which were the same as those performed in earlier periods), and thus receive sustenance from the divine food offerings. It also emphasized the owner's devotion to the god, and gave him a claim on the deity's attention. This tradition emphasized the fact that the gods were now regarded as better guarantors of individual postmortem protection than the age-old mortuary cults." "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." <sup id="cite_ref-583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-583">[583]</a></sup> 4.

For worshipers, the animals' relation to deities was comparable to that of living and deceased human intermediaries. Some sacred animals gave oracles. Although an individual could dedicate burials of animals, the animals were not personal but communal religious property. While alive, they were kept in temple complexes, and they were normally buried in vaults or catacombs filled with the mummies of other animals of various species.

Phrases translated as “to marry” include “to establish a household” (grg pr), “to enter a household” (ʿq r pr n) and, in later periods, “to live together” (ḥms jrm) with someone. [...] Given the definitions of marriage in ancient Egyptian society, there was nothing inherent in the relationship to prevent polygamy—a man could, in theory, cohabit with more than one woman in pursuit of offspring. Polyandry, in which one woman has multiple husbands at the same time, is unattested. In practice, however, polygamy was uncommon outside of the royal family; cases of polygamy among nonroyals are uncommon and often ambiguous. The Egyptians tended toward multiple marriage in the form of serial monogamy rather than polygamy, since the ease and acceptance of divorce—as well as the mortality rate—made marriage and remarriage the most common pattern for individuals with multiple spouses. The infrequency of polygamy may also be a function of the expense of keeping additional wives and their children; the domestic dynamics of having multiple wives and the physical limitations of the home could also be limiting factors.
