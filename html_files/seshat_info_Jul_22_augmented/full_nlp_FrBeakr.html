[...] Rather than representing a coherent migration of a distinctive people, the Bell-Beaker phenomenon is better seen as the outcome of the kind of processes discussed at the end of Chapter 5: as part of the breakdown of traditional social structures and the emergence of more mobile ways of life that began in northern Europe after 3000 BC.

[...] In some regions Beaker practices were adopted wholesale and marked a sharp break with earlier traditions. In others there was some continuity: For example, final burials in some megalithic tombs contained Beaker material. Settlements belonging to the makers of Beaker pottery are elusive, and it has been suggested that they led a relatively mobile way of life, probably associated with pastoralism, though probably, like Corded Ware, Beaker material was used by communities practicing many economic strategies."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_7_FrBeakr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ succeeding (quasi)polity ♣ Atlantic Complex ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Supracultural entity ♣ Chalcolithic; Late Neolithic ♥</b>  [MAJIDBENAM_REF_8_FrBeakr]  "The following are the more important of the archaeological cultures, which fall within the timespan of the Late Neolithic: the south-eastern European Late Gumelnitsa, Salcutsa, and the Late Tripolye culture of the Ukraine, the central European Corded Ware, Globular Amphora, BodrogkeresztUr, Baden, late Funnel Beaker, and Bell Beaker cultures."

Some were composed of small, dispersed communities with 10 to 20 domestic units,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_21_FrBeakr] but larger groups could gather into fortified settlements: Los Millares in Spain was home to 1000-1500 people.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_22_FrBeakr] The Beaker culture is also associated with demographic growth in Europe, as the small-scale polities moved into previously marginal lands.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_23_FrBeakr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]The spread of this material culture has been interpreted as evidence for a wide set of circulation networks, fuelled by elite demand for prestige goods.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_24_FrBeakr] The items may have been exchanged on the occasion of social rituals consolidating the power of emerging leaders.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_25_FrBeakr] In this interpretation, the archaeologically visible spread of Beaker culture would not be tied to immigration but to the emergence of mobile ways of life,[MAJIDBENAM_REF_26_FrBeakr] with independent leaders affirming their belonging to a wider cultural sphere through the consumption and display of valuable items.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_27_FrBeakr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]Beaker people built on the legacy of their early Neolithic predecessors, reusing and modifying ceremonial structures such as Stonehenge.[MAJIDBENAM_REF_28_FrBeakr] However they distinguished themselves through their burial customs, preferring single burials in grave pits to passage and gallery graves.

It seems that the population of the areas of influence of the Bell Beaker was mainly dispersed. The settlements are single or isolated, or, at most, there are concentrations of 10 to 20 domestic units. This type of settlement may allow its inhabitants to move with a certain frequency." [MAJIDBENAM_REF_30_FrBeakr] From that we can infer that polity population was probably around 100 inhabitants.

This ridge 700-800 m long and between 70-100 m wide, would give roughly 5 to 8 ha of fertile land. This area could be expected to support a family of four to seven people (Harrison 1986). If all the eight sites along the ridge were occupied at the same time, the total number of people in this long "village" would number only up to 50 individuals (Harrison 1986)."

"Use of carts suggests the presence of roads. As previously mentioned, a cart track was found under a Funnel Beaker megalithic tomb at Flintbek, near Kiel in Germany in 1989 (Zich 1993) which can be dated typologically to around 3630/3500 BC. A number of scholars have attempted to reconstruct Neolithic roadways. Bakker(1976:66-67)notes that "the difference between the prehistoric major routes in the North European Plain and those of the early Middle Ages was very slight" Also, the existence of trackways in bog areas may be connected with the appearance of carts around 3500 BC. Wooden trackways, 4 m wide and made of oak, pine, alder and ash, dated to the Third millennium BC have been found in bogs in northern Germany (Hayen 1985). Trees from an estimated 40 ha of forest were needed to construct 1 km of trackway. The trackway at DUmmer, dated to the mid-third millennium BC, is 2.5 km long and used 15,000 planks from 2,500 trees, mostly alder, for its construction. Not all trackways were suitable for wheeled transport as has been shown by Coles (1975). The track built of split alder trunks at Abbot's Way in England is over 1200 m long, but only 1-1.5 m wide, with an irregular surface. Such constructions indicate that members of Neolithic communities could be mobilized from time to time for communal activities."

Distincive bell-shaped beakers were buried with human remains and consistently grave goods of daggers and wrist guards [MAJIDBENAM_REF_83_FrBeakr]. [MAJIDBENAM_REF_84_FrBeakr][MAJIDBENAM_BR]"Death and Afterlife. Most of our information about the ideology of the Bell Beaker communities comes from graves and funerary rites. The common funerary rite of the Bell Beaker communities is the single burial. The most frequent rite is the inhumation of the body in a crouched position and in a single burial in a grave pit beneath a low barrow. The position of men was different from the position of women: Men were buried with their heads facing north and their bodies lying on their left side; and women with their heads facing south and their bodies lying on their right side; the bodies of both men and women faced east. The grave goods were also different depending on sex. And in some cases, it seems that the occupations of the buried individual were reflected in the grave goods. The funerary rites of the Bell Beaker communities were classified in central Europe in a very strict way, but, in the rest of Europe, there is more variability. For example, in Great Britain and in Ireland, the influence of the Bell Beaker rituals was mostly reflected in an increase in the number of single burials, as an innovation from previous funerary rituals. But in these areas, the burials do not follow a uniform pattern in terms of the orientation of bodies, and there is a higher variability in the shape of graves (besides the typical single burial in a grave pit beneath a low barrow, there are wells, stone cists). In many cases, the burials do not have a trousseau. In Southeast France as well as in the Iberian peninsula, although there were single burials, the most common burial of the Bell Beaker communities was based on the reuse of previously built or previously used funerary structures: megalithic sepulchers and near caves. In the case of the burials in old sepulchers, it is very difficult to define which objects pertain to which individual and in which position the bodies were buried."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_85_FrBeakr]</div><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Largest_scale_collective_ritual_of_the_official_cult">Largest scale collective ritual of the official cult</span><span

Central Iberia. Unfortunately, very little appears to have been written about the way the Bell Beaker phenomenon developed in the Paris Basin. "The discovery of Beaker pottery both in settlements and tombs clearly evidences that the commensality rituals in which they were used and displayed took place not only at funerals but also at other social ceremonies in the habitats. Bell Beakers have been extensively documented in settlements, which has provided the argument for considering them domestic ware dedicated to everyday activities (cooking, storage, consumption). However, this may merely be a false dichotomy between rituals (burials and monuments) and the domestic (purely economic), typical of modern western society, and which was presumably not the case either in primitive groups or in prehistoric ones (Bradley 2003, 2005). "Moreover, in our opinion there are a number of arguments which might suggest that they were in fact extremely special pots for very special social occasions (Rojo et al. 2008b). First, they only represent 1-5% of the total amount of pottery in each settlement where they are located, meaning that the activities for which they were used probably not so frequent. At the same time, although certain vessels were roughly made, most Beaker pottery in the Iberian interior was carefully made, in certain cases exhibiting a fine finish (even burnished in some examples), thin walls (4-5 mm.), and sinuous profiles in addition to which the decoration is often not confined to the outside of the vessel but also appears inside (near the rim) and occasionally on the bottom or base (Fig. 7.6, 7.8). Taken together, all of these are clearly non-functional features for everyday ware, and even less so for cooking pots (Garrido-Peña 2000, 80-167). The ceramic Beaker forms documented in settlements are the same as those present in tombs (Bell Beakers, carinated bowls, ‘cazuelillas’ and bowls), with the additional appearance of decorated storage vessels (Fig. 7.4). Given their dimensions, these large clearly domestic usage pots, might have played a major role in Beaker commensality rituals, as previously mentioned, whether as a vessel for brewing the beverages consumed in the Bell Beakers - alcoholic beverages as shown in content analyses - or for use in feasts. "[...] "The presence of Beaker pottery in settlements might also have reflected the practice of commensality rituals in the domestic sphere of social life, always in special and significant ceremonial contexts for the group. In the absence of any stable political institutions, and in a situation of unstable leadership, as appears to have been the case of the Beaker period (Garrido-Peña 1997, 2000, 2005, 2006), the custom of hospitality rituals or so-called ‘work party feasts’, where leaders donate large quantities of food and alcoholic drink to the community in exchange for labour (for example working on the host’s lands), well documented ethnographically (Sherratt 1987, 98; Dietler 1990, 1996; Adams 2004, 62), might have proved a good means to recruit supporters and manpower. In the El Ventorro Beaker settlement (Madrid), the large concentration of Beaker potsherds and fauna (nearly 80% of the remains discovered at the site) documented in a large hut (number 013) has been interpreted as the vestiges of feasting activities (Díaz del Río 2001). In this habitat, the excavation of pit 025 (Priego and Quero 1992) has also yielded extremely special materials such as three almost complete Beaker vessels and the exceptional Beaker cup potsherd already mentioned. Unfortunately, this was an old excavation and no information is available concerning for example the faunal remains of the structure, or content analysis of the vessels, although it seems plausible to argue that they were the remains of a particular ritual event in which perhaps beer was consumed in those very special vessels, before these were finally and intentionally broken and thrown to the pit (Rojo et al. 2008b, 323). "In fact the production of prestigious alcoholic beverages is one possible way to acquire power and wealth. The investment of surplus in the form of beer consumed by certain members of the community in those feasts might create obligations or deferred reciprocity, serving as an important instrument for the acquisition of power. The greater the benefit which leaders could promise to their supporters for their contribution to those competitive feasts, the greater the motivation those supporters had to produce surplus and allow the leaders to control it. Leaders compete with each other to organize ever more important feasts, in order to attract external supporters and exchange relationships (Karp 1980; Vencl 1994, 313-4; Hayden 1995, 1996; 2001; Adams 2004, 61). Ethnographic records are rich in examples of the value of beer in ‘primitive’ societies. In many African groups, beer is a valued luxury food, and an indicator of status and wealth that also required a significant investment in terms of grain and labor (Arthur 2003, 516-7). "[...] "It then seems reasonable to argue that during the full Copper Age in central Iberia both in domestic life and in special rituals and occasions (burial ceremonies and commemorations), complex commensality rituals were held in a competitive and politically unstable social context, which proved particularly favourable for such phenomena. The struggle for power and the search for supporters might have stimulated the competitive organization of hospitality ceremonies and feasts amongst emerging leaders seeking to build or reinforce their social position. The complex network of exchanges and relationships (political pacts, marriage exchanges), already known in the region since the Neolithic, evolved and increased in size and intensity during the Chalcolithic, at a time when increasing social tensions emerged. Bell Beakers began to circulate and were used in this changing and unstable scenario, one of the contexts in which they displayed their full potential and social value probably being commensality rituals held in settlements and tombs as a crucial part of the social life of these communities."[MAJIDBENAM_REF_86_FrBeakr]</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> in absolute numbers</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (participants) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ Inclusiveness (audience) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b><b>Dysphoric elements</b><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fasting ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that this ritual likely revolved around feasting and drinking [MAJIDBENAM_REF_87_FrBeakr].</div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ vigil/sleep deprivation ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ fear ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ humiliation ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ disgust ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></div><div class='meatypart'><b>♠ poisoning/dysphoria-causing drugs ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Chemical analyses of residue found in a number Bell Beaker pots suggest that they once contained a mixture of alcohol and hallucinogenic substances [MAJIDBENAM_REF_88_FrBeakr].

remains after death and particularly death by violence (such as murder, execution, and death in battle). Many Iron Age ritual enclosures and pits contained human skeletal remains from people who were either sacrificed or buried there after death. Similarly, it is usually impossible to ascertain whether graves that contain more than one burial represent the sacrifice of individuals such as slaves, followers, or wives to accompany an important person into death; such sacrifices are attested to in Thracian, Scythian, and other steppe burials but may not have been practiced else- where. The fortuitous preservation of Iron Age bodies in bogs, however, confirms the classical references to human sacrifice. Such bog bodies were rare in other periods but not entirely absent: For example, the bodies of two fourth-millennium individuals who had suffered an unnatural death were found in a bog at Stoney Island in Ireland, and a few others are known from Denmark. Since the deposition of votive offerings goes back to Mesolithic times, it is possible that some of the early collections of human remains, such as the Ofnet skull nest and the Talheim massacre, may also be evidence of human sacrifice."
