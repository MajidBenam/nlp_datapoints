It is interesting that while this was a case of conflict within a society, it apparently originated within an administrative elite rather than between "classes" of markedly different social and economic characteristics. This view is supported by the rapid depopulation of the Susiana as seen primarily in the abandonmnt of smaller settlements. The aggregate area of large centers decreased by 22 percent from approximately 43 to 35 hectares.
